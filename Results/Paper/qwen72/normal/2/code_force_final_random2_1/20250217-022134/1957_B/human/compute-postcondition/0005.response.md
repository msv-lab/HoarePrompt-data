Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1` and its current value is 1.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`.

The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the second element in the list `l1`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not explicitly provided, we can only describe it based on the given information.

Output: **k (where k is the second element in the list l1)**
