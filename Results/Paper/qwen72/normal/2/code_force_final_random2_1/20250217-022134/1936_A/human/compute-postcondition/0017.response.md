Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), `i` is 3, the output buffer has been flushed, and `mak` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the final state includes all the initial conditions with the updated value of `mak`.
