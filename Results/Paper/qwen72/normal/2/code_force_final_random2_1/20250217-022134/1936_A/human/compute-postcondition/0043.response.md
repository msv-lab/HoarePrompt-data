The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing `[1]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, and `pans` is an empty list if `s` is neither `<` nor `=`. The output buffer has been flushed.**
