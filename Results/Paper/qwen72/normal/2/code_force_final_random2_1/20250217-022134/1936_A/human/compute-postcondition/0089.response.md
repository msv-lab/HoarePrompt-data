The `sys.stdout.flush()` function flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all data written to `sys.stdout` is immediately sent to the terminal or console. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `mak` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the user input, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed.**
