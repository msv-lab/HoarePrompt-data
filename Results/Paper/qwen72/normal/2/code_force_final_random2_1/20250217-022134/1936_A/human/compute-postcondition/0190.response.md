Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
   - `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
   - The standard output buffer has been flushed.
   - `s` is the user input string.
   - If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1 and `pans` is `[1]`.
   - If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0, 1]`.
   - Otherwise, `pans` is `[1]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will output a question mark followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `mak` and `mak2` are both described as the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
   - The value of `mak` and `mak2` depends on the user input `s`:
     - If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1.
     - If `s` is `=`, `mak` is not specified, but since `mak` and `mak2` are both the largest integer for which the user input was `<`, they would both be 1 if `s` is `<`.
     - If `s` is anything else, `mak` and `mak2` are not specified, but they would still be 1 if `s` is `<`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the user input `s` is `<`, `mak` and `mak2` are both 1.
   - Therefore, the print statement will output:
     - `?` (question mark)
     - `1` (value of `mak`)
     - `1` (value of `mak2`)
     - `2` (value of `i`)
     - `1` (value of `mak2` again)

Output: **? 1 1 2 1**
