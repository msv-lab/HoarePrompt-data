To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **String Literal**: The first argument to the `print` function is the string literal `'?'`.
2. **Variable `mak`**: The variable `mak` is used twice in the `print` statement. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the value of `mak`. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value.
3. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is used twice in the `print` statement. According to the initial state, `i` is 1.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the string `'?'` followed by the value of `mak` twice, and then the value of `i` twice. Since the value of `mak` is not specified, we will represent it as `mak`.

Output: **? mak mak 1 1 (where mak is the value of the variable `mak`)**
