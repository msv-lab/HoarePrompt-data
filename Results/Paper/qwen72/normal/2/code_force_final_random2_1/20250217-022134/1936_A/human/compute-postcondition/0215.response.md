Postcondition: ***`n` remains the same as the input integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `mak` is either 0 or `n + 1` depending on whether the user input was '>' (if it was, `mak` is `n + 1`; otherwise, it remains 0 or `n` as initially set), `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was '<', `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was '=' or '<' and must have at least `n + 2` elements, the standard output buffer has been flushed.***
