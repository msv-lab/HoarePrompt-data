The provided code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all output is written immediately. This operation does not alter the values of any variables or change the program's state beyond the flushing of the output buffer.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 0 or 1, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed.**
