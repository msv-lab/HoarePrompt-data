Postcondition: ***`n` remains the same as the input integer, `i` is `n`, `mak` is either 0 or `n` depending on the user input (0 if the input was not '>' and `n` if the input was '>'), `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was '<', `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was '=' or '<' and must have at least `n + 1` elements, the standard output buffer has been flushed.***
