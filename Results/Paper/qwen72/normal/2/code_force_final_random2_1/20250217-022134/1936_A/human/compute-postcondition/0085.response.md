Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mak` is updated to the current value of `i`, which is 2.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `mak2`, `pans`, and the output buffer status) remain unchanged from their initial state.
