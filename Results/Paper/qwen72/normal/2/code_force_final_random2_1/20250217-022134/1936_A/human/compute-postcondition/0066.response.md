Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` remains the same as the initial value.
- `i` is 3.
- `mak` is 2 if the user input was `>`, otherwise `mak` remains 0 or 1 depending on the initial user input.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 4 elements.
- The output buffer has been flushed.
- The user input is either `>` or not `>`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`pans` List**: 
   - `pans` is a list containing integers where the user input was `=` or `<`.
   - It must have at least 4 elements.

2. **`mak` Value**:
   - If the user input was `>`, then `mak` is 2.
   - Otherwise, `mak` is 0 or 1 (depending on the initial user input).

3. **`i` Value**:
   - `i` is 3.

### Determining the Values:
- Since `pans` has at least 4 elements, `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]` are valid indices.
- If the user input was `>`, then `mak` is 2, so `pans[mak]` is `pans[2]`.
- If the user input was not `>`, then `mak` is 0 or 1, so `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]` or `pans[1]`.

### Final Output:
- The print statement will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `pans[mak]`, `pans[mak]`, `pans[i]`, and `pans[i]`.

### Case 1: User Input was `>`
- `mak` is 2.
- `pans[mak]` is `pans[2]`.
- `pans[i]` is `pans[3]`.
- Output: `? pans[2] pans[2] pans[3] pans[3]`.

### Case 2: User Input was not `>`
- `mak` is 0 or 1.
- `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]` or `pans[1]`.
- `pans[i]` is `pans[3]`.
- Output: `? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[3] pans[3]` (where `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]` or `pans[1]`).

### Final Answer:
Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[3] pans[3]** (where `pans[mak]` is `pans[2]` if the user input was `>`, otherwise `pans[0]` or `pans[1]` depending on the initial user input).
