The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the standard output buffer, which means it ensures that all data written to the standard output (like print statements) is actually written out immediately. This operation does not change the values of any variables.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 3
- `i` is 3
- If the user input is a string equal to `<`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains undefined.

Since the code snippet only affects the output buffer and does not modify any variables, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, if the user input is a string equal to `<`, `mak` is 1; otherwise, `mak` remains undefined.**
