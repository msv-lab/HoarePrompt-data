The code snippet `pans.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `pans`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`
- `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`
- The standard output buffer has been flushed
- `s` is the user input string
- If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1 and `pans` is `[1]`
- If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0, 1]`
- Otherwise, `pans` is `[1]`

After executing the code snippet:
- `pans` will be updated to include the value of `i`, which is 2.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`
- `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`
- The standard output buffer has been flushed
- `s` is the user input string
- If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1 and `pans` is `[1, 2]`
- If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0, 1, 2]`
- Otherwise, `pans` is `[1, 2]`

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, the standard output buffer has been flushed, `s` is the user input string, if `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1 and `pans` is `[1, 2]`, if `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0, 1, 2]`, otherwise, `pans` is `[1, 2]`**
