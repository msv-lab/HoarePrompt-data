Output State: **`n` remains the same as the initial value, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to the original value of `mak` (which could be 0 or the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<`), `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 2 elements, the output buffer has been flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the state of the output buffer.
