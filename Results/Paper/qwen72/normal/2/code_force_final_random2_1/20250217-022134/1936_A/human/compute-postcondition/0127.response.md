To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` remains the same
- `i` is `n-1`
- `mak` is 0
- `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`
- `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`
- The output buffer has been flushed

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the length of the list `pans`.
- For the loop to execute, `len(pans)` must be greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `len(pans) - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `i` should be initialized to 1 (the starting value of the loop).
- `pans` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`n` remains the same, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 2 elements, the output buffer has been flushed**
