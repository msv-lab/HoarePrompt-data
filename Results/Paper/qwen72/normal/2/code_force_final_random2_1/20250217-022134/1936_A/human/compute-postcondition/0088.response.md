Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `mak` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the user input.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`.
- The output buffer has been flushed.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will print a string starting with `'?'`.
- It will then print the value of `mak` twice.
- It will then print the value of `i` twice.

### Values:
- `mak` is either 0, 1, or 2 (depending on user input).
- `i` is 3.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the following:
- The character `'?'`.
- The value of `mak` twice.
- The value of `i` twice.

Since `mak` can be 0, 1, or 2, the output will depend on the value of `mak`.

### Possible Outputs:
- If `mak` is 0: `? 0 0 3 3`
- If `mak` is 1: `? 1 1 3 3`
- If `mak` is 2: `? 2 2 3 3`

### Final Answer:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 3 3 (where [mak] is the value of mak, which can be 0, 1, or 2)**
