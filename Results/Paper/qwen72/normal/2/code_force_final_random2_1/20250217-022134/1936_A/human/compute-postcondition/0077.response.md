Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Let's break down the values being printed:

- `'?'`: This is a string literal and will be printed as is.
- `mak`: According to the initial state, `mak` is 0.
- `mak` (again): Again, this is 0.
- `i`: According to the initial state, `i` is 1.
- `i` (again): Again, this is 1.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
