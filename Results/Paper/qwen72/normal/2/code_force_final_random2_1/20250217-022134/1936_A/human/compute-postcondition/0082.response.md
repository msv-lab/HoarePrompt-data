The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is 0 or 1, `mak2` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than `i`, which means `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 0 or 1, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed.**
