To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given State:
- `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`.
- The standard output buffer has been flushed.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the length of the list `pans`.
- For the loop to execute, `len(pans)` must be greater than 1, because the range function `range(1, len(pans))` will generate values from 1 to `len(pans) - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The variable `i` is not relevant to the initial state of the loop head, as it will be set by the loop itself.
- The list `pans` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`n` remains the same as the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 2 elements, the standard output buffer has been flushed.**
