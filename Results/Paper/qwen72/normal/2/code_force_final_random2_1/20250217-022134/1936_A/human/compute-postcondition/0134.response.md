Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` remains the same (its value is not specified, but it is a positive integer).
- `i` is 2.
- `mak` is 1 if the user input is `>`, otherwise `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 3 elements.
- The output buffer has been flushed.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`pans` List**:
   - `pans` contains integers where the user input was `=` or `<`.
   - Since `pans` must have at least 3 elements, let's assume `pans` has at least 3 elements: `[p1, p2, p3, ...]`.

2. **`mak` Value**:
   - `mak` is either 0 or 1 depending on the user input.
   - If the user input was `>`, `mak` is 1.
   - If the user input was not `>`, `mak` is 0.

3. **Indices in `pans`**:
   - `pans[mak]` will be either `pans[0]` or `pans[1]` depending on the value of `mak`.
   - `pans[i]` will be `pans[2]` because `i` is 2.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by four values from the `pans` list.
   - The first two values are `pans[mak]` repeated twice.
   - The last two values are `pans[i]` repeated twice.

### Possible Outputs:
- If `mak` is 0:
  - The print statement will be: `? pans[0] pans[0] pans[2] pans[2]`.
- If `mak` is 1:
  - The print statement will be: `? pans[1] pans[1] pans[2] pans[2]`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `pans` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `pans`.

Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[2] pans[2] (where `pans[mak]` is either `pans[0]` or `pans[1]` depending on the user input, and `pans[2]` is the third element of the `pans` list)**
