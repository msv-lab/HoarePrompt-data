To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - If the user input is a string equal to `<`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains undefined.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print a question mark followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`.
   - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - The value of `mak` depends on the user input:
     - If the user input is `<`, `mak` is set to 1.
     - If the user input is anything other than `<`, `mak` remains undefined.

4. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If the user input is `<`, `mak` is 1, so the `print` statement will output:
     ```
     ? 1 1 3 3
     ```
   - If the user input is not `<`, `mak` is undefined, and the `print` statement will raise a `NameError` because `mak` is not defined.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will depend on the user input. However, since the user input is not specified in the initial state, we need to consider both possibilities:

- If the user input is `<`:
  Output: **? 1 1 3 3**
- If the user input is not `<`:
  Output: **NameError (because `mak` is undefined)**

Since the task requires a single output, and without knowing the user input, we can only provide the most precise description based on the given conditions:

Output: **? 1 1 3 3 (if user input is `<`), otherwise NameError (because `mak` is undefined)**
