Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is a placeholder (not used in the print statement).
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `pans` is a list containing `[1]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, and `pans` is an empty list if `s` is neither `<` nor `=`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Explanation of Variables:**
   - `mak`: This variable holds the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2`: This variable is equal to `mak`.
   - `i`: This variable is explicitly set to 2.
   - `mak2` (repeated): This is the same as `mak`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `?`, followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` separated by spaces.
   - Since `mak2` is equal to `mak`, the values of `mak` and `mak2` will be the same.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be `?` followed by the value of `mak` (which could be 0 or any integer 1 ≤ i < n), then the value of `mak2` (which is the same as `mak`), then the value of `i` (which is 2), and finally the value of `mak2` again.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest integer i (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<` or 0 if no such i exists)**
