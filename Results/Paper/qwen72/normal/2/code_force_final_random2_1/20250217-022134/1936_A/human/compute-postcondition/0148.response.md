Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

Explanation: The value of `mak` is set to 0, overriding its previous value. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `mak2`, `pans`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The output buffer has already been flushed, and this state remains valid.
