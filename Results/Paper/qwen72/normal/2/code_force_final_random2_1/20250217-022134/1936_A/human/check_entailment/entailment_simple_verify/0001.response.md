### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can make up to \( 3n \) queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of indices.

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - The program starts by finding the index \( \text{mak} \) such that \( p_{\text{mak}} \) is the maximum value in the permutation.
   - This is done by comparing \( p_{\text{mak}} \) with each \( p_i \) for \( i \) in \( 1 \) to \( n-1 \).

3. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair:**
   - Once \( \text{mak} \) is identified, the program then tries to find another index \( \text{mak2} \) such that \( p_{\text{mak}} \oplus p_{\text{mak2}} \) is maximized.
   - It does this by comparing \( p_{\text{mak}} \) with each \( p_i \) again, but this time it keeps track of indices that have the same value as \( p_{\text{mak}} \) (i.e., \( p_{\text{mak}} \mid p_i = p_{\text{mak}} \)).

4. **Final Comparison:**
   - After identifying potential candidates for \( \text{mak2} \), the program compares the XOR values of these candidates to find the maximum.
   - It prints the indices \( \text{mak2} \) and the candidate with the maximum XOR value.

5. **Query Count:**
   - The program makes \( n-1 \) queries to find \( \text{mak} \).
   - It then makes \( n \) queries to find potential candidates for \( \text{mak2} \).
   - Finally, it makes up to \( \text{len(pans)} - 1 \) queries to find the maximum XOR value among the candidates.
   - The total number of queries is \( (n-1) + n + (\text{len(pans)} - 1) \leq 3n \), which satisfies the constraint.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( n = 2 \) correctly, as it will directly compare the two elements and output the result.
   - For larger \( n \), the program ensures that it finds the maximum XOR value efficiently within the query limit.

### Detailed Analysis of the Code:

- **Initialization and Input Handling:**
  - The function reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
  - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).

- **Finding the Maximum Value \( \text{mak} \):**
  - The program initializes \( \text{mak} \) to 0 and iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \).
  - It queries \( p_{\text{mak}} \mid p_{\text{mak}} \) vs \( p_i \mid p_i \).
  - If the result is '<', it updates \( \text{mak} \) to \( i \).

- **Finding Potential Candidates for \( \text{mak2} \):**
  - The program initializes \( \text{mak2} \) to \( \text{mak} \) and an empty list \( \text{pans} \).
  - It iterates over \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \) and queries \( p_{\text{mak}} \mid p_{\text{mak2}} \) vs \( p_i \mid p_{\text{mak2}} \).
  - If the result is '<', it updates \( \text{mak} \) to \( i \) and resets \( \text{pans} \) to contain only \( i \).
  - If the result is '=', it appends \( i \) to \( \text{pans} \).

- **Finding the Maximum XOR Value:**
  - The program initializes \( \text{mak} \) to 0 and iterates over the indices in \( \text{pans} \).
  - It queries \( p_{\text{pans}[mak]} \mid p_{\text{pans}[mak]} \) vs \( p_{\text{pans}[i]} \mid p_{\text{pans}[i]} \).
  - If the result is '>', it updates \( \text{mak} \) to \( i \).

- **Outputting the Result:**
  - The program prints the indices \( \text{mak2} \) and \( \text{pans}[mak] \) as the final result.

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness of the Strategy:**
  - The strategy of finding the maximum value \( \text{mak} \) and then finding potential candidates for \( \text{mak2} \) is sound.
  - The final comparison to find the maximum XOR value among the candidates is also correct.

- **Query Efficiency:**
  - The program ensures that the total number of queries does not exceed \( 3n \), which is within the allowed limit.

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where \( n = 2 \) and larger values of \( n \).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the strategy to find the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized, while adhering to the query limit. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: **True**
