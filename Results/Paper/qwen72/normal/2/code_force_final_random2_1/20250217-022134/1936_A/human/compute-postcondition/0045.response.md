The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered data is written to the output stream immediately. This operation does not alter any of the variables in the current state.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing `[1]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, and `pans` is an empty list if `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, and the output buffer has been flushed.**
