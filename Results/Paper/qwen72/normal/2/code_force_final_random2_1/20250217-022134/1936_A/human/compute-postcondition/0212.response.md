To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `mak` is either 0 or `n` depending on the user input:
  - `0` if the input was not '>'.
  - `n` if the input was '>'.
- `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was '<'.
- `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was '=' or '<' and must have at least `n + 2` elements.
- The standard output buffer has been flushed.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`pans[mak]`**:
   - `mak` is either 0 or `n`.
   - If `mak` is 0, `pans[mak]` is the first element of `pans`.
   - If `mak` is `n`, `pans[mak]` is the element at index `n` of `pans`.

2. **`pans[i]`**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `pans[i]` is the element at index `n + 1` of `pans`.

3. **`pans` List**:
   - `pans` contains at least `n + 2` elements.
   - Since `pans` must have at least `n + 2` elements, both `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]` are valid indices.

### Possible Values:
- If `mak` is 0, then `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`.
- If `mak` is `n`, then `pans[mak]` is `pans[n]`.
- `pans[i]` is `pans[n + 1]`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the following:
- The string `'?'`.
- The value of `pans[mak]` twice.
- The value of `pans[i]` twice.

Since the exact values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]` depend on the specific values in the `pans` list, we can describe them as follows:

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where mak is either 0 or n, and i is n + 1)**
