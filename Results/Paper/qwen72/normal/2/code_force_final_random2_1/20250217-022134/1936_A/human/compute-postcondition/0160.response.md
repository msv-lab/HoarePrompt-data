The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 3), and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3. If the user input is a string equal to `<`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains undefined.**
