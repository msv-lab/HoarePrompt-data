Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `s` is the user input string, the output buffer has been flushed, if `s` is `<`, `mak` is 2 and `pans` is `[2]`, if `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[2]`, otherwise, `pans` is `[2]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pans = [i]` assigns the list containing the value of `i` to the variable `pans`. Since `i` is 2, `pans` is now `[2]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
