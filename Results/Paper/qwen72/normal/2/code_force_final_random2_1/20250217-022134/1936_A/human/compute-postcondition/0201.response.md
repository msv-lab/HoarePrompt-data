Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 2 elements.
- The standard output buffer has been flushed.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`pans[mak]`**:
   - `mak` is 0.
   - Therefore, `pans[mak]` is the first element of the list `pans`.

2. **`pans[mak]` (second occurrence)**:
   - This is the same as the first occurrence, so it is also the first element of the list `pans`.

3. **`pans[i]`**:
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `pans[i]` is the last element of the list `pans`.

4. **`pans[i]` (second occurrence)**:
   - This is the same as the third occurrence, so it is also the last element of the list `pans`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output a string with the format `?`, followed by the first element of `pans`, the first element of `pans` again, the last element of `pans`, and the last element of `pans` again.

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[n-1]] [pans[n-1]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the list pans and pans[n-1] is the last element of the list pans)**
