Postcondition: ***`n` remains the same as the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is 0 or `n-1` depending on the user input, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 2 elements, the standard output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is `>`, `mak` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.***
