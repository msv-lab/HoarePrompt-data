Postcondition: ***`n` remains the same, `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if the user input is not `>`, otherwise `mak` is 2. `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 3 elements, the output buffer has been flushed.***
