Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
- `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` is `[0]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list.
- `s` is the user input string.
- The output buffer has been flushed.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output a string starting with `?` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` separated by spaces.
- `mak` and `mak2` are both described as the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`. This means they are the same value.
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- Since `mak` and `mak2` are the same, the last two values in the print statement will be identical.

### Output:
The print statement will output the following:
- `?` (a literal question mark)
- `mak` (the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<`)
- `mak2` (which is the same as `mak`)
- `i` (which is 1)
- `mak2` (which is the same as `mak`)

Since `mak` and `mak2` are the same, the output will be:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 1 [mak]** (where `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<`)
