Output State: **`n` remains the same as the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 2 elements, the standard output buffer has been flushed.** 

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` ensures that the standard output buffer is flushed, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged.
