Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` remains the same (its value is not specified, but it is assumed to be greater than 3 since `i` is 3).
- `i` is 3.
- `mak` is 1 if the user input is not `>`, otherwise `mak` is 2.
- `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 4 elements.
- The output buffer has been flushed.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`pans`**: This list contains integers where the user input was `=` or `<`. It must have at least 4 elements.
2. **`mak`**: This variable is either 1 or 2 based on the user input.
3. **`i`**: This variable is 3.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
- **`pans[mak]`**: Since `mak` is either 1 or 2, `pans[mak]` will be the element at index 1 or 2 in the `pans` list.
- **`pans[i]`**: Since `i` is 3, `pans[i]` will be the element at index 3 in the `pans` list.

### Example Values:
- Let's assume `pans = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (this is a valid example since `pans` must have at least 4 elements).
- If `mak` is 1, then `pans[mak]` is `pans[1]` which is 2.
- If `mak` is 2, then `pans[mak]` is `pans[2]` which is 3.
- `pans[i]` is `pans[3]` which is 4.

### Final Output:
- If `mak` is 1, the print statement will output: `? 2 2 4 4`.
- If `mak` is 2, the print statement will output: `? 3 3 4 4`.

Since the exact value of `mak` depends on the user input, we need to consider both cases.

### Final Answer:
Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]] (where `pans[mak]` is the element at index `mak` in the `pans` list, and `pans[3]` is the element at index 3 in the `pans` list)**. 

For the specific example:
- If `mak` is 1: **? 2 2 4 4**
- If `mak` is 2: **? 3 3 4 4**
