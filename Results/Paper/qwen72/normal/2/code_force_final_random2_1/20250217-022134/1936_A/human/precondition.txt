t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, representing the length of the permutation p. The permutation p is a sequence of unique integers from 0 to n-1. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
