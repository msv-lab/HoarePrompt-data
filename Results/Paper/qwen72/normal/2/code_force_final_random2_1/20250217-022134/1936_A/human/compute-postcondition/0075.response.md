Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `mak` to 0, overriding its previous value. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `mak2`, `pans`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial state. The output buffer being flushed is also still valid.
