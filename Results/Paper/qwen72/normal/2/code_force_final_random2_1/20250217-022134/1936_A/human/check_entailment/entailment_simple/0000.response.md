### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Query Strategy**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`, which represents the length of the permutation.
   - The variable `mak` is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to track the index of the element that, when compared with others, helps in finding the maximum XOR.

2. **Finding the First Maximum**:
   - The first loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`. For each index `i`, it queries the comparison of `(p_mak | p_mak)` and `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i`. This step ensures that `mak` points to the index of the element that is part of the maximum OR value seen so far.

3. **Finding the Second Maximum**:
   - The variable `mak2` is set to `mak`. This will be used to track the second index that, when combined with `mak`, gives the maximum XOR.
   - The list `pans` is initialized to store potential candidates for the second index.
   - The second loop iterates through all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1`. For each index, it queries the comparison of `(p_mak | p_mak2)` and `(p_i | p_mak2)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i` and resets `pans` to `[i]`.
   - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `pans`.

4. **Finalizing the Maximum XOR Pair**:
   - The third loop iterates through the indices in `pans` to find the index `i` that, when compared with `pans[mak]`, gives the maximum OR value.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `mak` to `i`.
   - Finally, it prints the indices `mak2` and `pans[mak]` as the pair that maximizes the XOR.

5. **Query Count**:
   - The function uses at most `3n` queries, which is within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem's constraints and logic. It efficiently finds a pair of indices that maximize the XOR value using the allowed number of queries. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
