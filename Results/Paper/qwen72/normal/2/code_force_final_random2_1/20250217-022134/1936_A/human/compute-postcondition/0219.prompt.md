Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function operates in an interactive environment where the input is a secret permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and the interaction involves querying the comparison of bitwise OR results of selected indices. The function must find a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices is maximized, using no more than 3n queries. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, the length of the permutation n satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '<':
            mak = i
    mak2 = mak
    pans = []
    for i in range(n):
        print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        s = str(input())
        if s == '<':
            mak = i
            pans = [i]
        elif s == '=':
            pans.append(i)
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, len(pans)):
        print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '>':
            mak = i
    print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` remains the same as the initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`, or it remains the highest index where the user input was `>` during the loop, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` remains the same, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations, `n` remains the same as the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`, or 0 if no such input was given, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the standard output buffer has been flushed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
