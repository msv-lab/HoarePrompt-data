Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` remains the same (its value is not specified, but it is a constant).
- `i` is 1.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 2 elements.
- The output buffer has been flushed.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`pans[mak]`**:
   - `mak` is 0.
   - Therefore, `pans[mak]` is the first element of the `pans` list.

2. **`pans[mak]` (again)**:
   - Since `mak` is 0, this is the same as the first element of the `pans` list.

3. **`pans[i]`**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - Therefore, `pans[i]` is the second element of the `pans` list.

4. **`pans[i]` (again)**:
   - Since `i` is 1, this is the same as the second element of the `pans` list.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output a string where the first two elements are the first element of the `pans` list, and the last two elements are the second element of the `pans` list.

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]] (where [pans[0]] is the first element of the `pans` list and [pans[1]] is the second element of the `pans` list)**
