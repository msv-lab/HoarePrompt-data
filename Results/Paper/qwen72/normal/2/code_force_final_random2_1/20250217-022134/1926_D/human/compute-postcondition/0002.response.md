To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `_` and `times`.

- The variable `_` is a placeholder used in Python to indicate that the value from the loop (in this case, the range) is not needed. It will take on values from 0 up to but not including `times`.
- The variable `times` determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute at least once, `times` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of integers.
- The list of integers `a_1, ..., a_n` consists of non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `times` is an integer input by the user.
- `check` is 2147483647.

For the loop to execute, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `times` is greater than 0. The variable `_` will automatically be set to 0 at the start of the loop and will increment with each iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, the list of integers `a_1, ..., a_n` consists of non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `times` must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647**
