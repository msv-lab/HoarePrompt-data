Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, the list of integers `a_1, ..., a_n` consists of non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `times` must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `data` is a list of integers from the input, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `n`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, ..., a_n`, `times`, `check`, `data`, `dic`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` is now equal to the input integer `n`.
