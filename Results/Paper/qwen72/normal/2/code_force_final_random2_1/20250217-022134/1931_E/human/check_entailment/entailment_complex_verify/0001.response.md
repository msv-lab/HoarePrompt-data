### Reasoning:

1. **Base Case Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the base case where `n == 1`. However, there is a mistake in the implementation. The function should check the length of the string representation of the single number in `nums`, not `n` itself. The correct condition should be:
     ```python
     return 'Sasha' if len(str(nums[0])) >= m + 1 else 'Anna'
     ```
   - This ensures that the length of the number (or its reversed form) is checked against `m + 1`.

2. **Total Digit Count Calculation:**
   - The function correctly calculates the total number of digits in the list using `sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`. This is correct as it sums up the lengths of all numbers in the list.

3. **Counting Trailing Zeros:**
   - The function `zerocnts` is used to count the number of trailing zeros in each number. This is done by converting the number to a string and iterating from the end to find the first non-zero digit. The count of trailing zeros is returned. This is correct and necessary for the optimal play strategy.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The function `func_1` then sorts the counts of trailing zeros in descending order and iterates over them in steps of 2, subtracting the counts from the total digit count. This simulates Sasha's strategy of concatenating pairs of numbers, which reduces the total number of digits in the list. This is a correct approach to simulate the game.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - After processing all the numbers, the function checks if the remaining total digit count is at least `m + 1`. If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins. This is the correct final decision logic.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `n = 2`, `m = 2`, `nums = [14, 2]`
  - Anna can reverse `2` to get `2`, and Sasha can concatenate `2` and `14` to get `214` (or `142`), which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Sasha wins.
  - Output: `Sasha`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `n = 3`, `m = 5`, `nums = [9, 56, 1]`
  - Anna can reverse `56` to get `65`, and Sasha can concatenate `65` and `9` to get `659` (or `965`), which is less than \(10^5 = 100000\). Anna wins.
  - Output: `Anna`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `n = 4`, `m = 10`, `nums = [1, 2007, 800, 1580]`
  - Anna can reverse `2007` to get `7002`, and Sasha can concatenate `7002` and `800` to get `7002800` (or `8007002`), which is greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Sasha wins.
  - Output: `Sasha`

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `n = 4`, `m = 5`, `nums = [5000, 123, 30, 4]`
  - Anna can reverse `5000` to get `5`, and Sasha can concatenate `5` and `123` to get `5123` (or `1235`), which is less than \(10^5 = 100000\). Anna wins.
  - Output: `Anna`

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `n = 10`, `m = 10`, `nums = [6, 4, 6, 2, 3, 1, 10, 9, 10, 7]`
  - Anna can reverse `10` to get `1`, and Sasha can concatenate `1` and `10` to get `110` (or `101`), which is less than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Anna wins.
  - Output: `Anna`

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `nums = [6]`
  - Sasha wins if the length of `6` (or its reversed form) is at least `2`. Since `6` has only one digit, Anna wins.
  - Output: `Anna`

- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `nums = [10]`
  - Sasha wins if the length of `10` (or its reversed form) is at least `2`. Since `10` has two digits, Sasha wins.
  - Output: `Sasha`

- **Test Case 8:**
  - Input: `n = 8`, `m = 9`, `nums = [1, 2, 9, 10, 10, 2, 10, 2]`
  - Anna can reverse `10` to get `1`, and Sasha can concatenate `1` and `10` to get `110` (or `101`), which is less than \(10^9 = 1000000000\). Anna wins.
  - Output: `Anna`

- **Test Case 9:**
  - Input: `n = 4`, `m = 5`, `nums = [10, 10, 10, 10]`
  - Anna can reverse `10` to get `1`, and Sasha can concatenate `1` and `10` to get `110` (or `101`), which is less than \(10^5 = 100000\). Anna wins.
  - Output: `Anna`

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct but has a critical error in the base case handling. The base case should check the length of the single number in `nums`, not `n` itself. Once this is fixed, the program will handle all test cases correctly.

Final: **False**
