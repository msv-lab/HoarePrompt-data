The value of `tot` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. Since the condition about breaking out of the loop or if statement is not triggered by this code snippet, it does not affect the control flow.

Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 10^9, `tot` is 1, `i` is `len(num) - 1`. If the last character of `num` (i.e., `num[i]`) is not '0', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
