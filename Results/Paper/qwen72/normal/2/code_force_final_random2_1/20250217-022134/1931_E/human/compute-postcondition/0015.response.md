Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 10^9, `tot` is the number of trailing zeros in `num`, and `i` is the index of the first non-zero digit from the right, or -1 if all digits are zero.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from the last character of `num` to the first character.
- For each iteration, if the current character is '0', `tot` is incremented by 1.
- If the current character is not '0', the loop breaks.
- After the loop finishes, `tot` will hold the number of trailing zeros in `num`.
- The variable `i` will be the index of the first non-zero digit from the right, or -1 if all digits are zero (since the loop would have broken before reaching the end).

This output state accurately reflects the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
