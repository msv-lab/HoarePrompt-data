To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `low <= high`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `low` is either 0 or `(min(n, b) // 2) + 1` depending on whether `profit_next` is greater than or equal to `profit_mid`.
- `high` is either the minimum of `n` and `b` or `(min(n, b) // 2) - 1` depending on whether `profit_next` is greater than or equal to `profit_mid`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low <= high` must hold true. This means that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

Let's analyze the possible values of `low` and `high`:
- If `profit_next` is greater than or equal to `profit_mid`, then `low` is updated to `(min(n, b) // 2) + 1`.
- If `profit_next` is less than `profit_mid`, then `high` is updated to `(min(n, b) // 2) - 1`.

In both cases, the values of `low` and `high` are adjusted based on the comparison of `profit_next` and `profit_mid`. However, the key point is that `low` and `high` must still satisfy the condition `low <= high` for the loop to continue.

Since the exact values of `low` and `high` depend on the results of `profit_next` and `profit_mid`, we cannot definitively adjust these values without knowing the specific outcomes of these functions. However, we can ensure that the loop can execute one more time by maintaining the condition `low <= high`.

Therefore, the state should be:
State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is either 0 or `(min(n, b) // 2) + 1` depending on whether `profit_next` is greater than or equal to `profit_mid`; `high` is either the minimum of `n` and `b` or `(min(n, b) // 2) - 1` depending on whether `profit_next` is greater than or equal to `profit_mid`; `mid` is `(0 + min(n, b)) // 2`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is the maximum of 0 and `profit_mid`. `low` must be less than or equal to `high` for the loop to execute one more time.**
