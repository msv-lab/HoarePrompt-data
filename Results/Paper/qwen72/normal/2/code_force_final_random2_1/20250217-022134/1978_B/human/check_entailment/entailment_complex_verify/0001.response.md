Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the maximum profit Bob can make by selling `n` buns, where the first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`, and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at a fixed price `a`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the total profit for a given `k`.
   - The formula used is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
   - `k * b` is the sum of the prices of the first `k` buns if they were all sold at `b` coins.
   - `- k * (k - 1) // 2` adjusts for the fact that the prices decrease linearly (this is the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, which is the adjustment needed for the decreasing prices).
   - `(n - k) * a` is the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the fixed price `a`.
   - The function correctly implements the profit calculation for any valid `k`.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`, which are the possible values for `k`.
   - It iterates using a binary search approach, calculating the profit for the current `mid` and the next value `mid + 1`.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it means increasing `k` might yield a higher profit, so it updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - The maximum profit found during the search is returned.
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently, and the constraints are handled correctly.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - The binary search in `func_2` efficiently finds the optimal `k` by comparing the profits of consecutive values.
   - The constraints and edge cases are handled correctly, including when `k` is 0 or `n`.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

Final: **True**
