Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is `(min(n, b) // 2) - 1`; `mid` is `(0 + min(n, b)) // 2`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is the maximum of 0 and `profit_mid`. Additionally, `profit_next` is less than or equal to `profit_mid`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, which is `(min(n, b) // 2) - 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit`) remain unchanged.
