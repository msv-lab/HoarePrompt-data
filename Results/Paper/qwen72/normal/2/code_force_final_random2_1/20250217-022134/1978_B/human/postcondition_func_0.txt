The function `func_1` accepts four non-negative integer parameters `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, with the constraints `0 <= k <= min(n, b)` and `1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9`. It calculates and returns the value `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`. After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned value, which is the result of the specified arithmetic operation.
