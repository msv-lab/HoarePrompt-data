### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum profit Bob can make by selling \( n \) buns, where the first \( k \) buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
   - The modified price for the \( i \)-th bun (1 ≤ \( i \) ≤ \( k \)) is \( b - i + 1 \).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
     - This function calculates the total profit for a given \( k \).
     - The formula used is \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \).
     - This formula correctly computes the sum of the modified prices for the first \( k \) buns and adds the profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns sold at the usual price \( a \).

   - **`func_2(n, a, b)`**:
     - This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
     - It initializes `low` and `high` to 0 and \( \min(n, b) \) respectively.
     - It iterates using a binary search, calculating the profit for the current midpoint \( mid \) and the next midpoint \( mid + 1 \).
     - It updates the maximum profit found so far and adjusts the search range based on which profit is higher.
     - The function returns the maximum profit found.

3. **Binary Search Validity**:
   - The binary search approach is appropriate because the profit function is unimodal (it increases to a peak and then decreases).
   - By comparing the profit at \( mid \) and \( mid + 1 \), the function can efficiently narrow down the search range to find the optimal \( k \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \( k = 0 \), the function correctly returns the profit from selling all buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - When \( k = \min(n, b) \), the function correctly calculates the profit from selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price \( a \).

5. **Example Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the program:
     - For \( n = 4 \), \( a = 4 \), \( b = 5 \), the optimal \( k = 1 \) gives a profit of 17.
     - For \( n = 5 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \), the optimal \( k = 5 \) gives a profit of 35.
     - For \( n = 10 \), \( a = 10 \), \( b = 5 \), the optimal \( k = 0 \) gives a profit of 100.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit using a binary search approach and handles all edge cases and examples provided in the problem description.

Final: **True**
