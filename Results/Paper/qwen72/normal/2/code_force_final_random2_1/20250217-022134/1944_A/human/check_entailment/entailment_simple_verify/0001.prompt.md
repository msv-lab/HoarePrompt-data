You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2, representing the number of islands and the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
        
    #State: All iterations of the loop have completed. The variable `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each of the `t` test cases, the values of `n` and `k` were read from the input and the appropriate output was printed based on the condition `n if n - k <= 1 else 1`. The loop has executed exactly `t` times, and no further iterations will occur.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` islands, initially fully connected.
   - Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit.
   - We need to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater's optimal destruction.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `k` is 0, no bridges are destroyed, and Everule can visit all `n` islands.
   - If `k` is large enough to disconnect all bridges from island 1, Everule can only visit island 1.
   - The critical point is when `k` is just enough to disconnect island 1 from all other islands. This happens when `k >= n-1`.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It prints `n` if `n - k <= 1`, otherwise it prints `1`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - If `n - k <= 1`, it means `k` is large enough to disconnect island 1 from all other islands, so Everule can only visit island 1. This is correct.
   - If `n - k > 1`, it means `k` is not large enough to disconnect island 1 from all other islands, so Everule can still visit all `n` islands. This is also correct.

However, there is a logical error in the condition `n - k <= 1`. The correct condition should be `k >= n - 1` to check if all bridges from island 1 can be destroyed. The current condition `n - k <= 1` is equivalent to `k >= n - 1`, so the logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
