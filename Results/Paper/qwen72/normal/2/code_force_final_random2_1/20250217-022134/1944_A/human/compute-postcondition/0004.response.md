Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, the loop will execute again if there are remaining iterations as specified by the initial `int(input())`.** 

Explanation: The values of `n` and `k` are now updated to the integers read from the input. The other variables (`_` and `t`) remain unchanged, and the condition for the loop to execute again is still valid.
