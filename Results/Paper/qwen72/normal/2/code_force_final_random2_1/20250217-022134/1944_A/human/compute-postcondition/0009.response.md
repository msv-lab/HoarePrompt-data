Output State: **All iterations of the loop have completed. The variable `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each of the `t` test cases, the values of `n` and `k` were read from the input and the appropriate output was printed based on the condition `n if n - k <= 1 else 1`. The loop has executed exactly `t` times, and no further iterations will occur.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the initial number of test cases `t` has been fully processed. For each test case, the values of `n` and `k` were read from the input, and the correct output was printed according to the given condition. The loop has completed all `t` iterations, and there are no more test cases left to process.
