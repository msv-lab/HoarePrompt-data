Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\). `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. `t` is a list containing the values of `ai` whenever `op` was 0 after processing each element in `a`. `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, the bit at position 29 in `x` (`u`) is 0, `v` is even, `op` is the final result of the XOR operation of the 29th bit of each element in `a`, and `ai` is the final result of the XOR operation of all elements in `a` that contributed to `ai` when `op` was 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
- For each element `val` in `a`, the variable `op` is updated by XORing it with the 29th bit of `val`.
- The variable `ai` is updated by XORing it with `val`.
- If `op` is 0 after processing `val`, `ai` is appended to the list `t`, and `ai` is reset to 0.
- After all iterations, `t` will contain the values of `ai` whenever `op` was 0.
- The final value of `op` will be the result of XORing the 29th bit of each element in `a`.
- The final value of `ai` will be the result of XORing all elements in `a` that contributed to `ai` when `op` was 0.
- The variables `ans`, `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
