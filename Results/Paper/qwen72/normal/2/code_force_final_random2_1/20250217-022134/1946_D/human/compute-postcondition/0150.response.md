Postcondition: ***`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `u` is not 0, `v` is even, and the current value of `v` is non-zero. `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val`, and `a` has at least one element. If `op` is 0, `cnt` is 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains 0. `val` is the first element in `a`.***
