Functionality: ** The function `func_5` processes a list `a` of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and a non-negative integer `x` also less than \(2^{30}\). It returns the maximum value between the length of the list `a` after processing and a computed value `ans`. The value of `ans` is determined by counting the maximum number of elements in `a` whose bits at a specific position (from 29 to 0) match certain conditions. If these conditions are not met, the function may return -1. The function modifies the list `a` during its execution, but the original values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged. **
