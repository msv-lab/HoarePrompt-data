Output State: **`u` is now the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is now the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `u` is not 0, and `v` is even, the current value of `v` is non-zero, `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val`, `cnt` is 1, `a` must have at least one element, `val` is the first element in `a`. The current value of `op` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1.
- All other variables (`u`, `v`, `op`, `a`, `val`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions that `u` is not 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `a` has at least one element, and `val` is the first element in `a` are still valid.
- The current value of `op` remains 0.
