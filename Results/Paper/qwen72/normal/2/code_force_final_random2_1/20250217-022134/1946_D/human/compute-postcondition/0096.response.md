The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `op`) remain unchanged. The current value of `op` is still 0, and `a` remains a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), with at least one element.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and `a` must have at least one element. `op` is 0. `cnt` is increased by 1.**
