The code snippet `ai ^= val` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the variable `ai` and `val`, and assigns the result back to `ai`. Given the initial state:

- `a` is a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least three elements.
- `val` is the third element of `a`.
- `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.

After executing the code snippet:

- `ai` is updated to `ai ^ val`.

The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least three elements; `val` is the third element of `a`; `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `ai` is now `ai ^ val`.**
