Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least one element, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `t` is a list containing the value `ai`, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, the bit at position 29 in `x` (`u`) is 0, `v` is even, `op` is the bit at position 29 of `val`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, and `op` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `t.append(ai)` adds the value of `ai` to the list `t`.
- Before the code execution, `t` was an empty list. After the code execution, `t` contains the value of `ai`.
- All other variables (`a`, `n`, `x`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `op`, `ai`, and `val`) remain unchanged or retain their previously defined values.
