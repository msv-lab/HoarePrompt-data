To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `val` and `a`.

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements of the list `a`.
- For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, `a` must have at least one element. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0, and `a` must be a non-empty list.

### Final State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and it must have at least one element.
- `val` is the first element of `a`.

### State:
**`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least one element, `val` is the first element of `a`, `x` is updated to the value returned by `func_3()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, the bit at position 29 in `x` (denoted as `u`) is 1, `v` is even and currently has a non-zero value, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 0.**
