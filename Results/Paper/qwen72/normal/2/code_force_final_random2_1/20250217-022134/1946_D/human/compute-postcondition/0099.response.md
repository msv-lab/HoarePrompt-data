Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and `a` must have at least two elements. `op` is updated to the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.** 

Explanation: The value of `op` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `op` and the result of `(val >> i & 1)`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
