The code snippet `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates the value of `op` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `op` and the bit at position `i` (which is 29) of `val`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least three elements
- `val` is the third element of `a`
- `x` is updated to the value returned by `func_3()`
- `t` is an empty list
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 29
- The bit at position 29 in `x` (denoted as `u`) is 1
- `v` is even and currently has a non-zero value
- `op` is the result of `op` XOR the bit at position 29 of `val`. If `op` is 0, `cnt` is 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains 0

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. `val >> i & 1` shifts `val` right by 29 bits and then applies a bitwise AND with 1. This extracts the bit at position 29 of `val`.
2. `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise XOR between the current value of `op` and the extracted bit.

Since `i` is 29, the bit at position 29 of `val` is extracted and XORed with `op`.

Let's denote the bit at position 29 of `val` as `bit_29_val`.

- If `bit_29_val` is 0, `op` remains unchanged.
- If `bit_29_val` is 1, `op` is toggled (flipped).

Given that `op` was previously XORed with the bit at position 29 of `val`, and now it is XORed again with the same bit, the effect is to toggle `op` back to its original value before the first XOR operation.

Therefore, the final value of `op` will be the same as it was before the first XOR operation.

The output state is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least three elements
- `val` is the third element of `a`
- `x` is updated to the value returned by `func_3()`
- `t` is an empty list
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 29
- The bit at position 29 in `x` (denoted as `u`) is 1
- `v` is even and currently has a non-zero value
- `op` is the same as it was before the first XOR operation with the bit at position 29 of `val`
- If `op` is 0, `cnt` is 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains 0

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least three elements, `val` is the third element of `a`, `x` is updated to the value returned by `func_3()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, the bit at position 29 in `x` (denoted as `u`) is 1, `v` is even and currently has a non-zero value, `op` is the same as it was before the first XOR operation with the bit at position 29 of `val`, if `op` is 0, `cnt` is 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.**
