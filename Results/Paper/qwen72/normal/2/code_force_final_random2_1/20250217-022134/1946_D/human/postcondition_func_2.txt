The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the standard input, splits the input by spaces, and returns a map object that converts each split element into an integer. The input is expected to be a string of space-separated numerical values. After the function concludes, the returned map object can be iterated over to access the converted integers.
