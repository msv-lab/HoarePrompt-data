Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(29, -1, -1):
    u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
    if u == v == 0:
        continue
    if u == 0:
        if v % 2:
            return ans
        else:
            op = ai = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                ai ^= val
                if not op:
                    t.append(ai)
                    ai = 0
            a, t = t, []
    elif v % 2:
        continue
    elif v:
        op = cnt = 0
        for val in a:
            op ^= val >> i & 1
            if not op:
                cnt += 1
        ans = max(ans, cnt)
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\). `t` is an empty list. `ans` is -1, and `i` is 29. If the bit at position 29 in `x` (`u`) is 0, then `a` is a list containing the values of `ai` whenever `op` was 0 after processing each element in the original `a`. `v` is even, `op` is the final result of the XOR operation of the 29th bit of each element in `a`, and `ai` is the final result of the XOR operation of all elements in `a` that contributed to `ai` when `op` was 0. If `u` is 1, then if `v` is odd, the current iteration is skipped. If `v` is even and non-zero, `val` is the last element of `a`, `ans` is the maximum of -1 and `cnt`, and `op` is the result of XORing the bits at position 29 of all elements in `a`. If the final value of `op` is 0, `cnt` is the count of elements in `a` whose bit at position 29 is 0; otherwise, `cnt` is the count of elements in `a` whose bit at position 29 is 0 minus 1. If `v` is zero, the loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is the 29th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 29th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the final result of the XOR operation of the 29th bit of each element in `a`, `ai` is the final result of the XOR operation of all elements in `a` that contributed to `ai` when `op` was 0, `val` is the last element of `a`, `cnt` is the count of elements in `a` whose bit at position 29 is 0. If `u` is 0, `op` is the XOR of the 29th bits of all elements in `a`, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a` that contributed to making `op` zero at some point during the loop, and `a` is now a list containing the values of `ai` each time `op` became zero. If `u` is not 0 and `v` is odd, the state remains unchanged. If `u` is not 0 and `v` is even and not zero, `ans` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`. If `u` is not 0 and `v` is zero, the loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, and all other variables remain unchanged. If `u` is 0, `op` is the XOR of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `ai` is 0, `a` is an empty list, and `t` is the list containing the XOR of all elements in `a` if `op` is `False` after the final iteration; otherwise, `t` remains unchanged. If `u` is not 0 and `v` is odd, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `u` is not 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is the XOR of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `cnt` is the number of times `op` was 0 during the loop's execution, and `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `u` is not 0 and `v` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
