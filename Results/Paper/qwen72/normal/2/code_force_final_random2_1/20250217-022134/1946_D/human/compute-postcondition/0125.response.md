Postcondition: ***`u` is now the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is now the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is now `0 ^ (val >> 27 & 1)`, `ai` is `0`, `a` must have at least one element, `val` is the first element in the list `a`, and `t` is a list that now includes `0` as its last element if `op` is `False`. If `op` is `True`, `ai` remains `ai ^ val` and `t` does not change.***
