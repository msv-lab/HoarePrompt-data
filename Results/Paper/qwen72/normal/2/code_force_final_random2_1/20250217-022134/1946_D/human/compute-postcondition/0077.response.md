Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least one element; `val` is the second element of `a`; `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`; `ai` is 0; if `op` is 0 after the update, `t` is a list containing the value `val`; otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `a` remains a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least one element.
- `val` remains the second element of `a`.
- `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, where `i` is an unspecified index. This bitwise operation updates `op` based on the bit at position `i` of `val`.
- `ai` is set to 0.
- If `op` is 0 after the update, `t` is a list containing the value `val`. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.
