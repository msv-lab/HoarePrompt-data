The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `u` is not 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `a` has at least two elements, if the new `op` is 0, `cnt` is now 2; otherwise, `cnt` is now 1, `val` is the second element in `a`.**
