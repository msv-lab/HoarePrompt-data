Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least two elements, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `t` is a list containing the value `ai` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` is an empty list if `op` is 1, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, the bit at position 29 in `x` (`u`) is 0, `v` is even, `op` is now `op ^ (val >> 29 & 1)`, `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `val` is the next element in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> 29 & 1)`, which means the 29th bit of `val` is XORed with the current value of `op`.
- All other variables (`a`, `n`, `x`, `t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `ai`, `val`) remain unchanged or their conditions are still valid as described in the initial state.
