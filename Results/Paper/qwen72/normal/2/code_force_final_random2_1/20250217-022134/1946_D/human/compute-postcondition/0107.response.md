Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\). The variable `op` is the result of the XOR operation of the 29th bits of all elements in `a`. The variable `cnt` is the count of how many times `op` was 0 during the loop iterations. The variable `val` is the last element of `a` processed in the loop. The variable `ans` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `t`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `ai`) remain unchanged.**
