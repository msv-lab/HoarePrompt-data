The only object in the loop head is the variable `val`, which is taken from the list `a`. Therefore, we can only adjust `val` based on the elements of `a`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `a` is a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least one element.
- `val` is the first element of `a`.
- `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.
- If `op` is 0 after the update, `ai` is 0 and `t` is a list containing the value `ai ^ val`.
- Otherwise, `op` is not 0 and `ai` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element of `a` must become the new `val`. Since `a` contains at least one element, and the loop has already processed the first element, the list `a` must still contain at least one more element for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `val` is now the second element of `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least one element; `val` is the second element of `a`; `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. If `op` is 0 after the update, `ai` is 0 and `t` is a list containing the value `ai ^ val`. Otherwise, `op` is not 0 and `ai` remains unchanged.**
