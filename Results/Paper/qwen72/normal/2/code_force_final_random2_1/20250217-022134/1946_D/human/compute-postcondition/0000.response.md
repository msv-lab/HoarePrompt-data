Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).**

Explanation: The code snippet calls the function `func_3()` and assigns the returned values to `n` and `x`. The new values of `n` and `x` are whatever `func_3()` returns. The list `a` remains unchanged and continues to be a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).
