Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is the 29th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 29th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the final result of the XOR operation of the 29th bit of each element in `a`, `ai` is the final result of the XOR operation of all elements in `a` that contributed to `ai` when `op` was 0, `val` is the last element of `a`, `cnt` is the count of elements in `a` whose bit at position 29 is 0.**

Explanation:
- `u` is assigned the value of the 29th bit of `x` (since `i` is 28, `x >> i & 1` gives the 29th bit).
- `v` is assigned the sum of the 29th bits of all elements in `a` (since `i` is 28, `val >> i & 1` gives the 29th bit of each element in `a`).
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
