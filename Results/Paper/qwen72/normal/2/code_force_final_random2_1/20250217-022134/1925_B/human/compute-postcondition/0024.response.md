Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input and 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is 3, and `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on the conditions described. If `x % i == 0` and `n` ≤ `x // i`, `ans` is set to 3. If `x % i == 0` and `n` ≤ 3, `ans` is set to the maximum of the original `ans` (0 or 1) and `x // 3`. If `x % i == 0` and neither of these conditions is met, `ans` remains unchanged. If `x % i != 0`, `ans` remains unchanged.***
