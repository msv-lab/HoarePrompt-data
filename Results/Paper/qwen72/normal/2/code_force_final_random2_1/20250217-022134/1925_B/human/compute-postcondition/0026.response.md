To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` is the first integer from the input.
   - `n` is the second integer from the input, and \(1 \leq n \leq x\).
   - `i` is calculated as `isqrt(x) + 1`, where `isqrt(x)` is the integer square root of `x`.
   - `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` such that either \( n \leq \frac{x}{i} \) or \( n \leq i \). If no such divisor exists, `ans` remains 0.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `isqrt(x)` is the integer part of the square root of `x`. For example, if `x = 16`, then `isqrt(16) = 4`.
   - `i` is `isqrt(x) + 1`. So, if `x = 16`, then `i = 4 + 1 = 5`.
   - `ans` is determined based on the conditions involving `n`, `x`, and `i`.

3. **Finding `ans`:**
   - We need to find the largest divisor of `x` such that either \( n \leq \frac{x}{i} \) or \( n \leq i \).
   - To find the divisors of `x`, we iterate through numbers from 1 to `x` and check if they divide `x` without a remainder.
   - For each divisor, we check if it satisfies either of the conditions \( n \leq \frac{x}{i} \) or \( n \leq i \).
   - The largest divisor that meets these conditions is assigned to `ans`.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `x = 20` and `n = 4`.
   - `isqrt(20) = 4`, so `i = 4 + 1 = 5`.
   - We need to find the largest divisor of 20 such that either \( 4 \leq \frac{20}{5} \) or \( 4 \leq 5 \).
   - The divisors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20.
   - Checking the conditions:
     - For 20: \( 4 \leq \frac{20}{5} \) is false, \( 4 \leq 5 \) is true.
     - For 10: \( 4 \leq \frac{20}{5} \) is false, \( 4 \leq 5 \) is true.
     - For 5: \( 4 \leq \frac{20}{5} \) is true, \( 4 \leq 5 \) is true.
     - For 4: \( 4 \leq \frac{20}{5} \) is true, \( 4 \leq 5 \) is true.
     - For 2: \( 4 \leq \frac{20}{5} \) is true, \( 4 \leq 5 \) is true.
     - For 1: \( 4 \leq \frac{20}{5} \) is true, \( 4 \leq 5 \) is true.
   - The largest divisor that satisfies the conditions is 20.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the largest divisor of `x` that meets the given conditions.
   - If no such divisor exists, `ans` remains 0.

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x such that either n ≤ x // i or n ≤ i, or 0 if no such divisor exists)**
