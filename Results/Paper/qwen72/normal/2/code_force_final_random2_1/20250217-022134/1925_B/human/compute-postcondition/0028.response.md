Functionality: ** The function reads two integers, `x` and `n`, from the input, where `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8` and `1 ≤ n ≤ x`. It then calculates the largest divisor of `x` such that either `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `n` is less than or equal to `i`, where `i` is a divisor of `x`. If no such divisor exists, the function prints `0`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
