To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i`, `x`, and the function `isqrt(x)`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(1, isqrt(x) + 1)` contains at least one value. This means `isqrt(x) + 1` must be greater than 1.
3. **isqrt(x)**: The function `isqrt(x)` returns the integer square root of `x`. For the loop to execute, `isqrt(x)` must be at least 1.
4. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
   - `x` is the first integer from the input.
   - `n` is the second integer from the input, and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
   - `ans` is 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` starts at 1.
- **`x`**: For the loop to execute, `isqrt(x)` must be at least 1. Since `isqrt(x)` is the integer square root of `x`, `x` must be at least 1 (because `isqrt(1) = 1`).

### Final State:
- `t` remains as an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `x` must be at least 1.
- `n` remains as the second integer from the input, and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
- `ans` remains 0.
- `i` is 1.

### State:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input and 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**
