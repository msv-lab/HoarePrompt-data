Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `y` is an input integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is `x - 2`, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`. If `num` is 1, `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1 plus 1. Otherwise, `count` remains the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1.***
