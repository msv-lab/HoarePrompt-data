You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the last input integer, `x` is the last input integer that must be greater than 0, `y` is the last input integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is `x - 2`, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`, `_` is equal to `T`, ensuring the loop has executed `T` times. If `num` is 1, `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1 plus 1. Otherwise, `count` remains the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads and processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of the number of sides of a polygon (`n`), the number of vertices chosen by Bessie (`x`), and a placeholder value (`y`). It also reads a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function calculates and prints the number of additional vertices that can be chosen such that no two chosen vertices are adjacent. After processing all test cases, the function ends without returning any value. The final state includes the printed results for each test case, and the input variables `t`, `T`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `list0` reflect the last processed test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves a regular polygon with `n` sides, where `x` vertices are already chosen by Bessie. The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing no more than `y` additional vertices. In this version, `y` is always 0, so we cannot add any new vertices.

2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by the list of `x` chosen vertices.

3. **Sorting the Vertices**: The program sorts the list of chosen vertices, which is necessary to calculate the gaps between consecutive vertices.

4. **Counting Triangles**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of vertices and calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive vertices. Each gap of size 1 can contribute to forming a triangle.
   - It also checks the gap between the last vertex and the first vertex (considering the polygon is cyclic).

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The program adds the number of gaps of size 1 to `x - 2`. This is because each chosen vertex can form a triangle with its adjacent vertices, and the total number of triangles formed by `x` vertices is `x - 2`.

6. **Output**: The program prints the calculated number of triangles for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:
- **Gap Calculation**: The program correctly identifies gaps of size 1 between consecutive vertices and counts them.
- **Cyclic Gap**: The program correctly handles the cyclic nature of the polygon by checking the gap between the last and first vertices.
- **Triangle Counting**: The formula `count + x - 2` is correct for counting the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed with the given vertices.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the input, sorting, gap calculation, and final triangle counting correctly.
