Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is `x - 2`, `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1. If `num` is 1, then `count` is incremented by 1 and `num` remains 1.***
