The code `list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `list0`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `T` is an input integer that must be greater than 0
- `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 (updated from input)
- `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5) (updated from input)
- `y` is an integer (updated from input)
- The second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`

After executing the code, the list `list0` will contain the `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` provided in the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 (updated from input), `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5) (updated from input), `y` is an integer (updated from input), `list0` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**
