Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is the new input integer, `x` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `y` is the new input integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is `x - 2`, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`, `_` is incremented by `x - 1`, ensuring `T` remains greater than the current value of `_`. `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1. Additionally, the current value of `num` is 1.**
