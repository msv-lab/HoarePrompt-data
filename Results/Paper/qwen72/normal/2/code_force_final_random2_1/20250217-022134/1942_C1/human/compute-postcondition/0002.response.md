The provided Python code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into three parts, which are then converted to integers and assigned to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `T` is an input integer that must be greater than 0
- `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9
- `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)
- `y` is an integer equal to 0
- The second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`

After executing the code snippet:
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values read from the input.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `T` is an input integer that must be greater than 0
- `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 (updated from input)
- `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5) (updated from input)
- `y` is an integer (updated from input)
- The second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` (still valid)

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 (updated from input), `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5) (updated from input), `y` is an integer (updated from input), the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**
