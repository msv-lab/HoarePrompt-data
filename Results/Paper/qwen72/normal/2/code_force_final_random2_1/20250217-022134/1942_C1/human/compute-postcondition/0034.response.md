Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `y` is an input integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is 0. If `num` is 1, `count` is 1 and `num` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 and `num` is `list0[1] - list0[0] - 1`.***
