The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. 

- `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases, with each test case providing a pair of `n` and `k`.
- `n` is an integer representing the length of the strings to be formed, and `k` is an integer representing the number of the first lowercase English alphabets to be used. Both `n` and `k` are within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 26.

For each test case, the function returns a string composed of the first `k` characters of the alphabet repeated `n` times. The string 's' is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw', and the returned string is a substring of 's' from the start up to the `k`-th character, repeated `n` times.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. It processes `t` test cases, each with a pair of integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it returns a string composed of the first `k` characters of the alphabet, repeated `n` times.**
