Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly address the problem requirements. The function `func_1` generates a string by repeating the first `k` letters of the alphabet `n` times. This approach does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters are included in the output string.

For example, for the input `(2, 2)`, the expected output should be a string like `"baab"` which includes all possible subsequences of length 2 using the letters 'a' and 'b'. However, the provided solution would output `"aabb"`, which does not include the subsequence "ba".

A correct solution would need to generate a string that includes all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters, ensuring that the string is as short as possible. This typically involves a more complex algorithm than simple repetition.
