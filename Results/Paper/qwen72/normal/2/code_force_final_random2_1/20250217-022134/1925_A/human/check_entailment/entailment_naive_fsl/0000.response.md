Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided solution does not generate a string `s` that ensures all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence. Specifically, the function `func_1` simply repeats the first `k` letters of the alphabet `n` times, which does not guarantee that all combinations of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

For example, consider the input `n = 2` and `k = 3`. The expected output should be a string where all possible 2-letter combinations of 'a', 'b', and 'c' (i.e., 'aa', 'ab', 'ac', 'ba', 'bb', 'bc', 'ca', 'cb', 'cc') appear as subsequences. However, the provided solution generates the string `abcabc`, which does not include all these combinations as subsequences. For instance, the combination 'cc' is not a subsequence of `abcabc`.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it fails to meet the requirement for at least one potential case.
