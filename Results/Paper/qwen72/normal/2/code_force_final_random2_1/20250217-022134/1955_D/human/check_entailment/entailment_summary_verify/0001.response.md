### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Initial Counters**:
   - The program initializes `cnt_aa` with the first `m` elements of `a` using `Counter`.
   - It initializes `cnt_bb` with all elements of `b` using `Counter`.

3. **Intersection and Differences**:
   - `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, representing the common elements and their counts.
   - `pairs_in_D` is the sum of values in `D`, which represents the number of matching elements.
   - `E` is the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, representing elements in `a` that are not in `b`.
   - `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, representing elements in `b` that are not in `a`.

4. **Initial Check**:
   - If `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, it sets `fnd` to 1, indicating that the initial segment is good.

5. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new element `in_aa` and the element being removed `out_aa`:
     - It updates the counters `D`, `E`, and `C` accordingly.
     - It checks if the updated `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` and increments `fnd` if true.

6. **Output**:
   - After processing all subsegments, it prints the value of `fnd` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of Input Handling**:
  - The program correctly reads the input in the specified format and processes each test case independently.

- **Correctness of Initial Counters**:
  - The use of `Counter` from the `collections` module is appropriate for counting elements in arrays `a` and `b`.
  - The intersection `D` and differences `E` and `C` are computed correctly.

- **Correctness of Sliding Window Logic**:
  - The sliding window approach is efficient and correctly updates the counters as the window moves through the array `a`.
  - The conditions for updating `D`, `E`, and `C` are logically sound and ensure that the number of matching elements is accurately tracked.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 1 or when `m` is equal to `n` correctly.
  - It also handles cases where there are no matching elements or where all elements match.

### Conclusion:

The program is logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality. It handles the input and output formats as specified, and the sliding window approach ensures efficiency and correctness.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
