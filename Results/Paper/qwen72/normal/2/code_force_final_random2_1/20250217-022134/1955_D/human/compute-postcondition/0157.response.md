Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their previous values. The loop will continue if there are still elements in both `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` to form a new pair `(in_aa, out_aa)`.**
