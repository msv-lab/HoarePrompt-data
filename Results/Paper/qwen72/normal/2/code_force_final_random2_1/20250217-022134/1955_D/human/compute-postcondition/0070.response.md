Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `fnd` will be the total number of times `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` (i.e., the common elements and their minimum counts), `E` and `C` counters will reflect the final state of the intersection and differences between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` after processing all elements in the loop, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `nabors` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time, `aa` is now a list of strings from the input, `bb` is now a list of strings from the new input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in `bb`.**
