Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with a length greater than `m`, `in_aa` is the third element of `aa[m:]`, and `out_aa` is the third element of `aa[:n - m]`. If `C[in_aa]` > 0, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 (if `D[out_aa]` > 0), `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 (if `E[out_aa]` > 0), otherwise `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1, `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1. If `C[in_aa]` <= 0, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 (if `D[out_aa]` > 0), `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 (if `E[out_aa]` > 0), otherwise `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1, and `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.***
