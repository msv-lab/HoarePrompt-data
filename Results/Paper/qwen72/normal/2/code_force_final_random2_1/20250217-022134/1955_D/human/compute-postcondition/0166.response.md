Output State: **`E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` before the execution of the if-else block; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. If `D[out_aa]` > 0, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` <= 0, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` <= 0, `E[out_aa]` is also decremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values. The loop will continue if there are still elements in both `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` to form a new pair `(in_aa, out_aa)`.**
