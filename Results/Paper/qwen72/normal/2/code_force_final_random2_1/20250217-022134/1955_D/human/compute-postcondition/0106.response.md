Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with a length greater than `m`, `in_aa` is the second element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the second element of `aa[:n - m]`. If `C[in_aa]` > 0, `C[in_aa]` is two less than its original value (if it was greater than 1), `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `D[out_aa]` and `E[out_aa]` remain unchanged, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, and `fnd` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `C[in_aa]` is one less than its previous value (if it was greater than 0), `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `D[out_aa]` and `E[out_aa]` are updated based on the conditions described, `pairs_in_D` is updated accordingly, and `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged.***
