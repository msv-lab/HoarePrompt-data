The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into three parts, converting each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial condition that `nabors` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by this code.

Output State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.**
