Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `fnd` will be the total number of times `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution, `D`, `E`, and `C` counters will reflect the final state of the intersection and differences between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` after processing all elements in the loop, `pairs_in_D` will be the final count of intersecting pairs in `D`, `nabors` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time, `aa` is now a list of strings from the input, `bb` is now a list of strings from the new input.**
