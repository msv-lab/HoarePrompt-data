Postcondition: ***`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` before the execution, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `in_aa` (next element in `aa[m:]`), `out_aa` (next element in `aa[:n - m]`), `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `E`, `C`) retain their previous values.***
