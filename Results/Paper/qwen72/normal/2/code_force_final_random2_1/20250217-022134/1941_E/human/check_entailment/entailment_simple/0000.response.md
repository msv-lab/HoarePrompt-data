Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input for multiple test cases and processes each test case individually. It reads the dimensions of the grid, the number of bridges, and the maximum distance between supports, followed by the grid itself.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function starts by incrementing the first `d-1` elements of the row by 1. This is correct because these elements represent the cost of installing supports at the beginning of the row.
   - **Dynamic Programming**: The function then iterates through the rest of the row, calculating the minimum cost of installing supports while ensuring the distance constraint is met. The use of `min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i])` ensures that the minimum cost of the previous `d+1` elements is considered, which is necessary to maintain the distance constraint.
   - **Return Value**: The function returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the total cost of installing supports in that row.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Reading Input**: The function reads the input for a single test case, including the grid and the parameters.
   - **Calculating Costs**: It calls `func_1` for each row to calculate the cost of building a bridge in that row.
   - **Summing Consecutive Costs**: It then calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows.
   - **Finding Minimum Cost**: Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 1 (building only one bridge) and when `k` is equal to `n` (building bridges in all rows).
   - The constraints ensure that the input is valid, and the program handles these constraints correctly.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the minimum cost, which is appropriate given the constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
