Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `len(costs) - k`, `costs` remains a list of length `n`, and `total_costs` is a list containing the sums of every consecutive `k` elements in `costs`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will have reached the value `len(costs) - k`.
- The list `costs` will still have the same length `n` as it did initially.
- The list `total_costs` will contain the sum of every consecutive `k` elements from the list `costs`. For example, if `k` is 3, `total_costs` will contain the sums of elements `[costs[0], costs[1], costs[2]]`, `[costs[1], costs[2], costs[3]]`, and so on, up to the last possible group of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`.
