Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `len(costs) - k`: This means that after the loop completes, the variable `i` holds the value of the length of the `costs` list minus `k`.
- `costs` remains a list of length `n`: This indicates that the `costs` list has `n` elements.
- `total_costs` is a list containing the sums of every consecutive `k` elements in `costs`: This means that `total_costs` is a list where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(min(total_costs))
```

### Analysis:
- `total_costs` is a list where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
- The `min(total_costs)` function will find the minimum value in the `total_costs` list.
- Since `total_costs` contains the sums of every consecutive `k` elements in `costs`, the `min(total_costs)` will return the smallest sum among these sums.

### Output:
The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum sum of any consecutive `k` elements in the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where min(total_costs) is the minimum sum of any consecutive k elements in the costs list)**
