To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i`.
   - The expression `len(costs) - (k - 1)` determines the range of the loop.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, the range must be non-empty, meaning `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 0.
   - This can be rewritten as `len(costs) > k - 1`.

3. **Adjust States:**
   - We need to ensure that `len(costs) > k - 1`.
   - The initial state provides that `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers with specific constraints.
   - `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers.
   - `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` with the corresponding row from `rows` and the integer `d`.

4. **Initial State Adjustments:**
   - Since `costs` is derived from `rows` and `d`, and `rows` has `n` elements, `len(costs)` should be `n`.
   - Therefore, the condition `len(costs) > k - 1` simplifies to `n > k - 1`.

### Final Adjusted State:
- To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than `k - 1`.
- The variable `i` starts at 0 and will iterate up to `len(costs) - (k - 1) - 1`.

### State:
**`n` is greater than `k - 1`, `i` is 0, `costs` is a list of length `n`**.
