The code snippet `total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))` appends the sum of a slice of the `costs` list from index `i` to `i + k` (exclusive) to the `total_costs` list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than `k - 1`
- `i` is 0
- `costs` is a list of length `n`

The slice `costs[i:i + k]` will be `costs[0:k]`, which includes the first `k` elements of the `costs` list. The sum of these elements is then appended to `total_costs`.

Since `total_costs` was not mentioned in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before this operation. After the operation, `total_costs` will contain one element, which is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`.

The values of `n`, `i`, and `costs` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `k - 1`, `i` is 0, `costs` is a list of length `n`, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`.**
