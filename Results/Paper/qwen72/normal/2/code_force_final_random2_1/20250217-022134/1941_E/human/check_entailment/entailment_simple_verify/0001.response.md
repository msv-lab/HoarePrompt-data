### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum cost to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid, ensuring that the distance between any two adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row.
   - It iterates through the row and updates the cost of each cell based on the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus the current cell's depth plus 1.
   - The function returns the cost of the last cell, which represents the total cost of building the bridge on that row.

   **Annotated Analysis:**
   - The first loop increments the cost of the first `d-1` cells by 1, which is correct because these cells must have supports.
   - The second loop updates the cost of each subsequent cell by adding the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus the current cell's depth plus 1. This ensures that the distance between supports does not exceed `d`.
   - The function returns the cost of the last cell, which is the total cost of building the bridge on that row.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - It then reads the grid and calculates the cost of building a bridge on each row using `func_1`.
   - It stores these costs in a list and finds the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost for each test case.

   **Annotated Analysis:**
   - The input is correctly read and parsed.
   - The grid is correctly processed, and the cost of building a bridge on each row is calculated using `func_1`.
   - The total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges is calculated by summing the costs of the selected rows and finding the minimum among all possible starting rows.
   - The result is printed for each test case.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:** The input is correctly read and parsed.
   - **Cost Calculation:** The cost calculation in `func_1` is correct. It ensures that the distance between supports does not exceed `d` and adds the cost of the current cell plus 1.
   - **Consecutive Bridges:** The function correctly calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of the selected rows and finding the minimum among all possible starting rows.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem requirements. It handles the input, processes the grid, and calculates the minimum cost for building the bridges as specified.

Final: **True**
