The value of `sub` is calculated as the difference between `length` and `count`. Since `count` is the number of "+" characters in `expression`, `sub` will be the number of "-" characters in `expression`.

Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string of length `length` (1 ≤ length ≤ 5000) consisting only of characters "+" and "-", `count` is the number of "+" characters in `expression`, `sub` is the number of "-" characters in `expression` (equal to `length - count`).**
