Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string of length `length` (1 ≤ length ≤ 5000) consisting only of characters "+" and "-", `count` is the number of "+" characters in `expression`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `count` will hold the total number of "+" characters found in the string `expression`. The length of `expression` remains unchanged, and it still consists only of the characters "+" and "-".
