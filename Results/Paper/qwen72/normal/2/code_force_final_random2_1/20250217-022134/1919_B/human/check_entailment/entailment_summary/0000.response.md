Reasoning:  
The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. To minimize the penalty, the optimal strategy involves splitting the array into subarrays where each subarray's sum is zero (if possible), because a subarray with a sum of zero contributes nothing to the total penalty.

However, the provided solution does not attempt to split the array into subarrays. Instead, it simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and returns the absolute difference between these counts. This approach does not consider the structure of the array or the possibility of splitting it into subarrays with a sum of zero, which is crucial for minimizing the penalty.

Given the problem's requirement to minimize the penalty through optimal splitting, the provided solution is not correct because it does not implement the required logic for splitting the array and calculating the penalty based on those splits. It only calculates the imbalance between '+' and '-' characters, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
