Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as specified. The function `func_1` calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which is not the same as calculating the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array optimally.

The correct approach should involve finding a way to split the array such that the sum of penalties of the subarrays is minimized. This often means trying to balance the sums of the subarrays as much as possible, especially by grouping positive and negative values together when beneficial.

The given solution simply returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-', which does not account for the optimal splitting strategy required to minimize the penalty. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.
