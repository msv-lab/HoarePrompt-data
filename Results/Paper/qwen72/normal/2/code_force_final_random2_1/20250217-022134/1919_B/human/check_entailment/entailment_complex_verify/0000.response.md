Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program provided does not solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string, which is not the same as finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array into subarrays.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the example provided in the original assessment:
- Input: `6\n+-+-+-`
- Correct Output: `0`
- Program Output: `6`

The correct approach involves finding a way to split the array such that the sum of penalties of the subarrays is minimized. For the input `+-+-+-`, one optimal way to split the array is `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, where each subarray has a penalty of `0` (since the sum of each subarray is `0` and the length is `2`). Therefore, the total penalty is `0`.

However, the provided program simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is `0` in this case, but it incorrectly returns `6` because it does not consider the optimal splitting strategy.

Thus, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program does not meet the problem's requirements.

Final: **False**
