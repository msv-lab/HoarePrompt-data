Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not address the core requirement of the problem, which is to find the optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. Instead, the program merely calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters in the string `expression`. This calculation does not take into account the specific rules for splitting the array and calculating the penalty, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.

For instance, in the example provided:
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```
The correct output should indeed be `0`, as the array can be optimally split into subarrays such as `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, each with a penalty of `0`. However, the program returns `6`, which is the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, but not the correct penalty.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem's requirements and the original assessment is correct.

Final: **False**
