The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since `count` was initially 1 if `char` is "+", and 0 otherwise, the new value of `count` will be 2 if `char` is "+", and 1 if `char` is "-". The values of `expression`, `length`, and `char` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string of length `length` (1 ≤ length ≤ 5000) consisting only of characters "+" and "-", `char` is the second character of `expression`, if `char` is "+", `count` is 2; otherwise, `count` is 1.**
