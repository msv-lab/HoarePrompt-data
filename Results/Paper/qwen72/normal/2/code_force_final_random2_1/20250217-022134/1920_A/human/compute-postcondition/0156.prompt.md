You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, and all pairs (a, x) are distinct within a test case. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        cx = set()
        
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        
        bx = -1
        
        for _ in range(n):
            a, x = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        
        if bx >= ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is a list with `t` elements, `n` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `_` is `n-1`, `a` and `x` are the last input integers provided by the user during the final iteration, `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` exists. `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` exists. `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` inputs where `a` was neither 1 nor 2. For each test case, if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, the corresponding element in `r` is `0`. Otherwise, the corresponding element in `r` is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.
    print(*r, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: Each element of the list `r` on a new line, where each element is either `0` or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` based on the conditions described.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a set of constraints. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is a pair `(a, x)` where `a` can be 1, 2, or 3, and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
