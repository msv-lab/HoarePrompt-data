Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, and all pairs (a, x) are distinct within a test case. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case. `r` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx >= ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is a list, `n` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `_` is `n-1`, `a` and `x` are the last input integers provided by the user during the final iteration. `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` exists. `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` exists. `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` inputs where `a` was neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` contains one element `[0]`. Otherwise, `r` contains one element equal to `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is a list, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `a` and `x` are the last input integers provided by the user during the final iteration, `bx` is the maximum value encountered among all inputs `x` when `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value encountered among all inputs `x` when `a` was 2, `cx` is a set containing all unique values `x` input when `a` was 3, and `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` contains two elements: the first element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` and the second element is 0. If `bx` is less than `ax`, `r` contains two identical elements each equal to `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `_` is `n`, `a` and `x` are the last input integers provided by the user during the final iteration. If any input `a` was 1, `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 1. If any input `a` was 2, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 2. All other `x` inputs where `a` was neither 1 nor 2 are added to the set `cx`. The variable `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` contains three elements: the first element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, the second element is `0`, and the third element is `0`. If `bx` is less than `ax`, `r` contains three identical elements each equal to `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
