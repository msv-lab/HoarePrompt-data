To determine what will be printed by the `print(num)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `num` step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
   - `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - Each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2.
   - No two constraints are the same within a test case.
   - `loop` must be greater than 0.
   - `iterable` is 0.
   - `num` is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count`.
   - `innerLoop` is the input integer.
   - `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`.
   - `x` and `a` are the last input integers read.
   - `no` is a non-empty list.
   - `i` is the last element of `no`.
   - `count` is the number of elements in `no` that are between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive.

2. **Calculation of `num`:**
   - `min(less)`: This is the minimum value in the list `less`.
   - `max(big)`: This is the maximum value in the list `big`.
   - `count`: This is the number of elements in the list `no` that are between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive.

3. **Forming the Expression:**
   - `num = min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count`

Given the initial state, we need to determine the values of `min(less)`, `max(big)`, and `count` to compute `num`.

- **`min(less)`**: This is the smallest value in the list `less`.
- **`max(big)`**: This is the largest value in the list `big`.
- **`count`**: This is the number of elements in the list `no` that fall within the range `[max(big), min(less)]` inclusive.

Since the exact values of `less`, `big`, and `no` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `num`. However, we can describe it in terms of the given variables.

Output: **num (where num is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count`, with `min(less)` being the minimum value in the list `less`, `max(big)` being the maximum value in the list `big`, and `count` being the number of elements in the list `no` that are between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive)**
