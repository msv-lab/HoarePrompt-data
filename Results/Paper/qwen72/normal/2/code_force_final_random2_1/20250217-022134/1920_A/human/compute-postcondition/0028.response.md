The code snippet `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Depending on the initial conditions, the state of the lists `big`, `less`, and `no` will be updated accordingly.

### Initial Conditions:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- Each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2
- No two constraints are the same within a test case
- `loop` must be greater than 0
- `iterable` is 0
- `num` is 0
- `innerLoop` must be greater than 2
- `iterable2` is 2
- `x` is the first input integer
- `a` is the second input integer
- If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `[a, a]`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists
- If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing `[a, a]`, and `big` is a list containing `[a]`, and `no` is an empty list
- Otherwise, `less` is a list containing `[a]`, and `big` is a list containing `[a]`, and `no` is a list containing the integer `a`

### Impact of the Code:
- The value of `a` is appended to the list `big`.

### Calculation of the Result:
- If `x` is 1:
  - `big` was initially `[a, a]`
  - After appending `a`, `big` becomes `[a, a, a]`
- If `x` is 2:
  - `big` was initially `[a]`
  - After appending `a`, `big` becomes `[a, a]`
- If `x` is anything else:
  - `big` was initially `[a]`
  - After appending `a`, `big` becomes `[a, a]`

### Output State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- Each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2
- No two constraints are the same within a test case
- `loop` must be greater than 0
- `iterable` is 0
- `num` is 0
- `innerLoop` must be greater than 2
- `iterable2` is 2
- `x` is the first input integer
- `a` is the second input integer
- If `x` is 1, `big` is `[a, a, a]`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists
- If `x` is 2, `less` is `[a, a]`, and `big` is `[a, a]`, and `no` is an empty list
- Otherwise, `less` is `[a]`, and `big` is `[a, a]`, and `no` is `[a]`

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, if `x` is 1, `big` is `[a, a, a]`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists, if `x` is 2, `less` is `[a, a]`, and `big` is `[a, a]`, and `no` is an empty list, otherwise, `less` is `[a]`, and `big` is `[a, a]`, and `no` is `[a]`.**
