The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the list `no`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `no`. If `no` has at least two elements, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element of `no`, and `no` is a non-empty list containing all values of `a` where `x` is neither 1 nor 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `no` must have at least three elements, and `i` will be the third element of `no`.

State: **`i` is the third element of `no`, `no` is a non-empty list containing all values of `a` where `x` is neither 1 nor 2, and `no` must have at least 3 elements.**
