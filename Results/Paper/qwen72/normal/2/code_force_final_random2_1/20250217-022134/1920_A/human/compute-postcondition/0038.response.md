Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last input integers read, the lists `big`, `less`, and `no` contain the values of `a` appended based on the corresponding values of `x` (1, 2, or any other value) for each iteration of the loop. If `num` is less than 1, the loop continues to the next iteration.***
