The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `x` and `a`, respectively. This operation changes the values of `x` and `a` from their initial state (where `x` is an input integer and `a` is an input integer) to the specific values provided by the user.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- Each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2
- No two constraints are the same within a test case
- `loop` must be greater than 0
- `iterable` is 0
- `num` is 0
- `innerLoop` must be greater than 1
- `iterable2` is 1
- `x` is an input integer
- `a` is an input integer
- If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists
- If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing `[a]`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists
- Otherwise, `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing the integer `a`

After executing the code snippet:
- `x` and `a` are updated to the specific values provided by the user.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 1, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is a specific input integer, `a` is a specific input integer, if `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists, if `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing `[a]`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists, otherwise, `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.**
