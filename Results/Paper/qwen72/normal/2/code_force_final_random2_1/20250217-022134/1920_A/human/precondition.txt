t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.
