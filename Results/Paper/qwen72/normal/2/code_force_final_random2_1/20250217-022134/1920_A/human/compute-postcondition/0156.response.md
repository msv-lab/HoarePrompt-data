Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by a set of constraints. It reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is a pair `(a, x)` where `a` can be 1, 2, or 3, and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. The function calculates and prints a result for each test case. If the maximum value of `x` for constraints of type 1 (`bx`) is greater than or equal to the minimum value of `x` for constraints of type 2 (`ax`), the result is 0. Otherwise, the result is the number of valid values between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) that do not appear in the set of constraints of type 3. The results are printed, each on a new line. **
