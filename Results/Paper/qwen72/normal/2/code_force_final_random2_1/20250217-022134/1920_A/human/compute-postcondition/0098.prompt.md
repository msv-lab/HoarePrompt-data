Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last input integers read, `no` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `i` is undefined, `less` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` is 2, `big` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` is 1. If `num` is less than 1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped and the program moves to the next iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in no:
    if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
        num -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is the first element of `no`, `no` is a non-empty list containing all values of `a` where `x` is neither 1 nor 2. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `num` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is the second element of `no`, `no` is a non-empty list containing all values of `a` where `x` is neither 1 nor 2. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `num` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is the third element of `no`, `no` is a non-empty list containing all values of `a` where `x` is neither 1 nor 2, and `no` must have at least 3 elements. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `num` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
