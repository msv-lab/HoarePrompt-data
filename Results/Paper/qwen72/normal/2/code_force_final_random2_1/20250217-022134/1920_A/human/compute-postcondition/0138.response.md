Postcondition: **`i` is undefined, `no` must contain at least one integer, `iterable` is `k + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `k + 1`, `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2, `big` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 1, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is the number of iterations executed, `x` and `a` are integers provided by user input during each iteration. If `num` is less than 1, the current value of `num` remains less than 1. Additionally, the current value of `i` is such that `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and `i` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`.**
