Reasoning:  
The program correctly processes the input and categorizes the constraints into three lists: `big` for constraints of type 1 (k ≥ x), `less` for constraints of type 2 (k ≤ x), and `no` for constraints of type 3 (k ≠ x). The program then calculates the range of valid values for k as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, which represents the number of integers between the maximum lower bound and the minimum upper bound, inclusive. This calculation is correct because it ensures that k satisfies both the "greater than or equal to" and "less than or equal to" constraints.

Next, the program iterates through the `no` list to exclude any values that fall within the valid range. This step is necessary because the constraints of type 3 (k ≠ x) explicitly exclude certain values from being valid. The program correctly adjusts the count by decrementing `num` for each excluded value.

The program handles edge cases where the range is invalid (i.e., `min(less) < max(big)`), in which case it prints 0. This is correct because there are no integers that can satisfy such constraints.

Overall, the program's logic aligns with the problem description and the execution summary confirms that it behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
