Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing `[a]`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. Otherwise, `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 1, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is a specific input integer, `a` is a specific input integer. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `[a, a]`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing `[a, a]`, and `big` is a list containing `[a]`, and `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `less` is a list containing `[a]`, and `big` is a list containing `[a]`, and `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer. If `x` is 1, `big` is `[a, a, a]`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `less` is `[a, a]`, `big` is `[a, a]`, and `no` is an empty list. For any other value of `x`, `less` is `[a]`, `big` is `[a, a]`, and `no` is `[a]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
