The code snippet `big.append(a)` adds the value of `a` (which is the second integer read from input) to the list `big`. Since `big` was initially an empty list, after executing this code, `big` will contain the value of `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is the first integer read from input and its value is 1, `a` is the second integer read from input, `no` is an empty list, `i` is undefined, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`.**
