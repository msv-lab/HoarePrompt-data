To determine what will be printed by the `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of how the list `r` is constructed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This determines the number of test cases.
2. **`r`**: A list with `t` elements, initially empty.
3. **`n`**: The number of iterations the loop has executed, which is equal to `t`.
4. **`_`**: Equal to `n-1`, which is `t-1`.
5. **`a` and `x`**: The last input integers provided by the user during the final iteration.
6. **`bx`**: The maximum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` exists.
7. **`ax`**: The minimum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` exists.
8. **`cx`**: A set containing all unique `x` inputs where `a` was neither 1 nor 2.
9. **`r` Construction**:
   - For each test case, if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, the corresponding element in `r` is `0`.
   - Otherwise, the corresponding element in `r` is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `bx`**:
   - `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 1.
   - If no such `x` exists, `bx` is -1.

2. **Determine `ax`**:
   - `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 2.
   - If no such `x` exists, `ax` is 1000000007.

3. **Determine `cx`**:
   - `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` inputs where `a` was neither 1 nor 2.

4. **Construct `r`**:
   - For each test case:
     - If `bx >= ax`, the corresponding element in `r` is `0`.
     - Otherwise, the corresponding element in `r` is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement will print each element of the list `r` on a new line. Each element in `r` is determined by the conditions described above.

Output: **Each element of the list `r` on a new line, where each element is either `0` or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` based on the conditions described.**

For example, if `t = 3`, and the values of `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` are such that:
- `bx = 5`, `ax = 10`, `cx = {6, 7, 8}`
- `bx = 15`, `ax = 10`, `cx = {11, 12, 13}`
- `bx = 20`, `ax = 25`, `cx = {21, 22, 23}`

Then the output would be:
```
4
0
3
```

Explanation:
- For the first test case: `bx = 5`, `ax = 10`, `tmp = 3` (since 6, 7, 8 are in `cx` and within the range [5, 10]), so `r[0] = 10 - 5 + 1 - 3 = 3`.
- For the second test case: `bx = 15`, `ax = 10`, so `r[1] = 0` because `bx >= ax`.
- For the third test case: `bx = 20`, `ax = 25`, `tmp = 3` (since 21, 22, 23 are in `cx` and within the range [20, 25]), so `r[2] = 25 - 20 + 1 - 3 = 3`.

Output: **Each element of the list `r` on a new line, where each element is either `0` or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` based on the conditions described.**
