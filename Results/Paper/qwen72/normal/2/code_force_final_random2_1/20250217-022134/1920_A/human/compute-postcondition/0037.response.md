The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. This means that none of the variables are updated or changed by the `continue` statement itself. However, the loop control flow is affected.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- Each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2
- No two constraints are the same within a test case
- `loop` must be greater than 0
- `iterable` is 0
- `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`
- `innerLoop` is the input integer
- `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`
- `x` and `a` are the last input integers read
- The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` contain the values of `a` appended based on the corresponding values of `x` (1, 2, or any other value) for each iteration of the loop
- The current value of `num` is less than 1

The `continue` statement does not change any of these conditions or variable values. It only affects the control flow of the loop.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last input integers read, the lists `big`, `less`, and `no` contain the values of `a` appended based on the corresponding values of `x` (1, 2, or any other value) for each iteration of the loop, the current value of `num` is less than 1, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
