Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is the last element of `no`.
2. `no` is a non-empty list containing all values of `a` where `x` is neither 1 nor 2.
3. For each element `i` in `no`, if `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1 for each such element.
4. The final value of `num` is the initial value of `num` minus the number of elements in `no` that satisfy the condition.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(num)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `no`**:
   - `no` is a list of values of `a` where `x` is neither 1 nor 2. This means `no` contains values of `a` for which `x` is something other than 1 or 2.
   - Since `no` is non-empty, it contains at least one element.

2. **Understanding the Condition**:
   - For each element `i` in `no`, the condition checks if `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`.
   - If this condition is true, `num` is decreased by 1.

3. **Final Value of `num`**:
   - The initial value of `num` is not explicitly given, but it is assumed to be some initial value.
   - The final value of `num` is the initial value minus the number of elements in `no` that satisfy the condition.

### Determining the Output:
- The exact value of `num` depends on the initial value of `num` and the number of elements in `no` that satisfy the condition.
- Without specific values for `no`, `less`, and `big`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `num`.

However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the final value of `num` after applying the condition to each element in `no`.

### Final Output:
Output: **num (where num is the initial value of num minus the number of elements in no that satisfy the condition)**
