Postcondition: **After the loop executes all iterations, `k` is 0, `i` is `k - 1`, `num` is the total number of times `num` was incremented based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `c` and `r` are the last set of input integers and remain unchanged. If `n` is 0, `i` and `dp` remain unchanged. If `n` is 1, `i` is -1 and `dp` remains unchanged. If `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n` and `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[1]` = 1, `dp[2]` = 3, and for each index `j` from 3 to `n`, `dp[j]` is calculated as `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).` Additionally, `m` is not equal to 0. If `m` is 1, the same conditions apply as described above. If `m` is not 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent elements calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).`**
