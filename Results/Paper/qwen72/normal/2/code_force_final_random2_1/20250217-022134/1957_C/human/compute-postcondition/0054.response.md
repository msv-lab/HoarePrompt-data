The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (as it is the next value in the range), and `k` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1.
- `k` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`k` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are input integers. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is increased by 2.**
