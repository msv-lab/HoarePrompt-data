The code snippet reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. This changes the values of `c` and `r` from their initial state (which was also input by the user) to new values provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 < `k` ≤ `n`, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers input by the user, `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 4.**
