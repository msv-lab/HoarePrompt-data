For the given task, the state right before the while loop is described as follows: `t` is an integer input by the user, representing the number of test cases. The `while` loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `t` is non-zero (i.e., `t` is true).

Given this, the loop can execute at least once if `t` is any positive integer. Since `t` is described as an integer input by the user and represents the number of test cases, it is reasonable to assume that `t` should be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time, as the condition `while t:` will be satisfied if `t` is any positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, representing the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played, respectively. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move made, where 1 ≤ `r_i`, `c_i` ≤ `n`. The `k` moves and the implied computer moves are valid. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.**
