The value of `num` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 4. After the increment, `num` will be 3 if `c` equals `r`, and 5 if `c` does not equal `r`. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 < `k` ≤ `n`, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers input by the user, `num` is 3 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 5.**
