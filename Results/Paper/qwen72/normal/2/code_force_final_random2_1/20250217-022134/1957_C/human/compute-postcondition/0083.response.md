Postcondition: ***`k` is 0, `i` is -1 if `m` is 1, otherwise `i` is `m`. `num` is the total increment based on the inputs `c` and `r` over all iterations, where for each iteration where `c` equals `r`, `num` was incremented by 1, and for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`, `num` was incremented by 2. `m` is `n - num`, and `m` is not equal to 0. The values of `n`, `t`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states. If `m` is 1, `dp` remains unchanged. If `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` = 1, `dp[2]` = 3, and for each index `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is calculated as `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.***
