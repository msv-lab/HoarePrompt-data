The value of `num` is incremented by 2. Initially, `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r`, and 3 otherwise. After the increment, `num` will be 4 if `c` equals `r`, and 5 otherwise. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is `n`, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `c` and `r` are the new input integers. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 4. Otherwise, `num` is 5.**
