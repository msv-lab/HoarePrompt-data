The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving a chessboard game scenario. The function accepts no direct parameters but reads from an input (likely standard input) the following:

- An integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case, two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ n), where `n` represents the size of the chessboard (n x n), and `k` represents the number of moves already played.
- Following `k`, there are `k` lines, each containing two integers `r_i` and `c_i` (1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n), which denote the row and column of the i-th move made.

The function processes these inputs and returns the result for each test case, which is not explicitly defined in the problem statement but typically involves some form of analysis or computation based on the moves made on the chessboard.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a chessboard size `n` and a number of moves `k`, followed by the specific moves made. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case, likely involving some analysis or computation based on the moves.**
