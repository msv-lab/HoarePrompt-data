Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `c` equals `r` or not, `m` is `n`, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `c` and `r` are the second set of input integers and remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The line `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `c` and `r`.
- The values of `c` and `r` are updated based on the new input, but their relationship (whether `c` equals `r` or not) determines the value of `num`.
- All other variables (`k`, `i`, `m`, `n`, `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `num` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `c` equals `r` or not, which is consistent with the initial state.
- The initial conditions for `k`, `i`, `m`, `n`, and `t` remain valid, and no additional changes are made to these variables by the given code snippet.
