To determine what will be printed by the `print(dp[m])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic used to populate the `dp` list:

### Initial State:
- `k` is 0.
- `i` is `m`.
- `num` is the total increment based on the inputs `c` and `r` over all iterations.
- `m` must be at least 3.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1`.
- `dp[1]` is 1.
- `dp[2]` is 3.
- For each index `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is calculated as `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % 10`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `dp[1] = 1`
   - `dp[2] = 3`

2. **Populating `dp` for indices 3 to `m`**:
   - For `j = 3`:
     \[
     dp[3] = (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) \% 10 = (3 + 2 * 1 * 2) \% 10 = (3 + 4) \% 10 = 7
     \]
   - For `j = 4`:
     \[
     dp[4] = (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) \% 10 = (7 + 3 * 3 * 2) \% 10 = (7 + 18) \% 10 = 25 \% 10 = 5
     \]
   - For `j = 5`:
     \[
     dp[5] = (dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) \% 10 = (5 + 4 * 7 * 2) \% 10 = (5 + 56) \% 10 = 61 \% 10 = 1
     \]
   - Continue this process up to `j = m`.

### General Formula:
For any `j` from 3 to `m`:
\[
dp[j] = (dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) \% 10
\]

### Final Value:
The value of `dp[m]` will depend on the specific value of `m`. Since the exact value of `m` is not provided, we can only describe the process and the formula used to compute `dp[m]`.

### Output:
The `print(dp[m])` statement will print the value of `dp[m]`, which is calculated using the formula:
\[
dp[m] = (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) \% 10
\]
where `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value calculated using the formula (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % 10)**
