Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `i` is 3, `c` and `r` are integers input by the user, `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is `(dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` which simplifies to `(3 + 2 * 1 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 7`.**
