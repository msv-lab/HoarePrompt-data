To determine what will be printed by the `print(dp[m])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to it:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input by the user minus 1.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5.
- `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`.
- `i` is `m`.
- `c` and `r` are integers input by the user.
- `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions inside the loop.
- `m` is `n - num`, and `m` is at least 3.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized to 0.
- `dp[1]` is 1.
- `dp[2]` is 3.
- `dp[i]` for each `i` from 3 to `m` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initialization of `dp` List:**
   - `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized to 0.
   - `dp[1]` is set to 1.
   - `dp[2]` is set to 3.

2. **Filling the `dp` List:**
   - For each `i` from 3 to `m`, the value of `dp[i]` is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]

3. **Final Value:**
   - The final value of `dp[m]` is the result of the above calculation for `i = m`.

### Explanation of the Output:
- The value of `dp[m]` is determined by the dynamic programming formula provided.
- Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `num` are not specified, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `dp[m]`.
- However, based on the structure of the problem, the `print(dp[m])` statement will output the value of `dp[m]` calculated using the given formula.

### Final Output:
Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value of the dp list at index m, calculated using the given dynamic programming formula)**
