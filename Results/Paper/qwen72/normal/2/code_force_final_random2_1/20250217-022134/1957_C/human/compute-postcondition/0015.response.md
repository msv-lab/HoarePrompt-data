The value of `num` is incremented by 2. Initially, `num` is set to 1 if `c` is equal to `r`, and to 2 if `c` is not equal to `r`. After the increment, `num` will be 3 if `c` is equal to `r`, and 4 if `c` is not equal to `r`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 < `k` ≤ `n`, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers input by the user, `num` is 3 if `c` is equal to `r` and 4 if `c` is not equal to `r`.**
