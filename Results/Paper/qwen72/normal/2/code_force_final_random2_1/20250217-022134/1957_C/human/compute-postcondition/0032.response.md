Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are integers input by the user, `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3.**

Explanation: The code snippet `dp[2] = 3` updates the second element of the list `dp` to 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The updated list `dp` now has its first element as 1 and its second element as 3, while the rest of the elements are still 0.
