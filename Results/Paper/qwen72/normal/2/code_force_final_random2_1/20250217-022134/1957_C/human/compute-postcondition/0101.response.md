The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 1), and `k` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`k` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is `n`, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `c` and `r` are the second set of input integers and remain unchanged. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 3.**
