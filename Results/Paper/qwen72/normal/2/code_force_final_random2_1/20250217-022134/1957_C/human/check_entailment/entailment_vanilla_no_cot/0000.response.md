Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, reading the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.

2. **Initial Moves Processing**: For each of the `k` moves, the program checks if the move is on the diagonal (`c == r`). If it is, it increments `num` by 1 (since only one rook is placed). If not, it increments `num` by 2 (since both the player and the computer place a rook).

3. **Remaining Moves Calculation**: The program calculates the number of remaining positions `m` where rooks can be placed without attacking each other, which is `n - num`.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Remaining Moves**: The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining positions. The DP array `dp` is initialized, and the base cases are set (`dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`). The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to fill the DP array, which correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the value of `dp[m]` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem requirements, and the program should produce the correct output for the given inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
