Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by the size of a chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played. It reads the moves and calculates a specific value based on the moves and the size of the board. The function prints the result for each test case, which represents the number of ways to place additional pieces on the board under certain constraints, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). After processing all test cases, the function terminates, and the variable `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
