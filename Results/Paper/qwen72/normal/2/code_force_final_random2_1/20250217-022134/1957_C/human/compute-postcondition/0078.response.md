Initial State: `k` is 0, `i` is 4, `num` is the total increment based on the inputs `c` and `r` over all iterations, `m` must be at least 4, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements set to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[3]` which is 8.

The code snippet:
```python
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. `i` is 4.
2. `dp[i - 1]` is `dp[3]`, which is 8.
3. `(i - 1)` is `3`.
4. `dp[i - 2]` is `dp[2]`, which is 3.
5. `(i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2` is `3 * 3 * 2 = 18`.
6. `dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2` is `8 + 18 = 26`.
7. `26 % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is `26 % 1000000007 = 26`.

Therefore, `dp[4]` is set to 26.

Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is 4, `num` is the total increment based on the inputs `c` and `r` over all iterations, `m` must be at least 4, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` = 1, `dp[2]` = 3, `dp[3]` = 8, and `dp[4]` = 26.**
