The provided `print` statement simply outputs the integer `0`.

Given the initial state:
- `k` is 0.
- `i` is `k - 1`, so `i` is -1.
- `num` is the total number of times `num` was incremented based on the conditions inside the loop.
- `m` is `n - num`.
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `t` is decreased by 1.
- `c` and `r` are the last set of input integers and remain unchanged.
- If `n` is 0, `i` and `dp` remain unchanged.
- If `n` is 1, `i` is -1 and `dp` remains unchanged.
- If `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n` and `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with specific values.
- Additionally, `m` is 0.

However, none of these variables or their values are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement only outputs the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
