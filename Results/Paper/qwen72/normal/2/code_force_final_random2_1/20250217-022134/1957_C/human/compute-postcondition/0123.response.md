Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent elements calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` for `i` from 3 to `m`; `k` is 0; `i` is `m`; `num` is the total number of times `num` was incremented based on the conditions inside the loop; `m` is `n - num` and must be greater than or equal to the final value of `i`; `n` is the first input integer; `t` is decreased by 1; `c` and `r` are the last set of input integers and remain unchanged; `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 3` to `i = m`, updating the `dp` array according to the given formula.
- After the loop completes, `dp` will contain the computed values up to `dp[m]`.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `m` after the loop finishes.
- All other variables (`k`, `num`, `m`, `n`, `t`, `c`, and `r`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
