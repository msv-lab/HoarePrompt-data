To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 2`.
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`.
   - `l` is currently equal to `n + 1`.

2. **Variables in the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is: `print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)`.
   - We need to determine the value of `v`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - The variable `v` is not directly mentioned in the initial state. However, since `v` is not defined in the given context, it must be assumed that `v` is a variable that exists in the broader scope of the program but is not provided in the initial state.

Given the information, we cannot determine the exact value of `v` from the initial state alone. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of `v`.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will print the string `! {i * v}` where `i` is 2 and `v` is an unknown value.
   - The final output will be: `! 2 * v`.

Output: **! 2 * v (where v is the value of the variable v)**
