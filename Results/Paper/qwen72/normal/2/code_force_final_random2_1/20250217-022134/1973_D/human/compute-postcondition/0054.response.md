Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` must be greater than 2.
- `cnt` is `k - 2`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.

2. **Value of `l`:**
   - `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`.
   - `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`.
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, `func_2()` can return any integer from 0 up to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `l` will be an integer from 1 up to `n`.

3. **Value of `v`:**
   - The variable `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Without additional context, we cannot determine the exact value of `v`.

4. **Expression `i * v`:**
   - Since `i` is 2, the expression `i * v` will be `2 * v`.
   - The value of `2 * v` depends on the value of `v`.

### Final Output:
Given the above analysis, the print statement will output a string in the format `? {l} {i * v}`. Since `l` is an integer from 1 up to `n` and `i * v` is `2 * v`, the output will be:

Output: **? [l] [2 * v] (where l is an integer from 1 up to n and v is the value of v)**
