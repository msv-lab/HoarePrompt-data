The code snippet calls the function `func_2()`. Based on the initial state, we know that `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1` and is also equal to `n + 1`. This implies that the return value of `func_2()` must be `n`.

When `func_2()` is called, it returns `n`. However, since no other operations are performed on the variables in the given code snippet, the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. The value of `l` remains `n + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 1`, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `n + 1`, and `func_2()` has been called and returned `n`.**
