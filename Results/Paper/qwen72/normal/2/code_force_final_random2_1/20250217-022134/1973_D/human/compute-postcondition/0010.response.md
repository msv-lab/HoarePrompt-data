The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `0`. The loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, starting from `n` down to `1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, and `v` is `return_value`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, making it `n-1`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `n-1` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, and `v` is `return_value`**.
