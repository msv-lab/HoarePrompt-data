Output State: **`i` is 0, `v` is the last return value of `func_2()`, and `n` remains unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` is reset to 0 because the loop has finished running through all possible values of `i` from 1 to `n // k`. The variable `v` is updated to the last value returned by `func_2()` during the final iteration of the loop. The variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution, as it is not modified within the loop.
