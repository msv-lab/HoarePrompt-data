To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

The loop condition is `while cnt and l < n + 1:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as both `cnt` is non-zero and `l` is less than `n + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `cnt`:**
   - The current state indicates that `cnt` is `k - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be non-zero.
   - Therefore, `cnt` must be greater than 0.

2. **Variable `l`:**
   - The current state indicates that `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `func_2() + 1` must be less than `n + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:

- **For `cnt`:** Since `cnt` is `k - 1`, it must be greater than 0. This implies that `k` must be greater than 1.
- **For `l`:** Since `l` is `func_2() + 1`, it must be less than `n + 1`. This implies that `func_2()` must be less than `n`.

### Final State:

Given the above analysis, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `cnt` must be greater than 0, which means `k` must be greater than 1.
- `l` must be less than `n + 1`, which means `func_2()` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` must be greater than 1, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `func_2()` must be less than `n`**.
