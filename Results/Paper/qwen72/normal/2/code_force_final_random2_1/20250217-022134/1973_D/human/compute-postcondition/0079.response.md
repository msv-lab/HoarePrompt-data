Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 3`.
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.
   - The current value of `cnt` is 0.
   - The current value of `l` is `n + 1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement uses an f-string to format the output.
   - It prints the value of `i * v` prefixed with an exclamation mark (`!`).
   - The variable `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - The variable `v` is not defined in the initial state or the code snippet.

Since `v` is not defined, it is impossible to determine the exact value of `i * v`. Therefore, the output will include an error or an undefined value for `v`.

Output: **! [i * v] (where i is 3 and v is undefined)**

However, if we assume that `v` should be a defined variable in the context, we would need more information to provide a precise value. Given the current information, the best we can do is indicate that `v` is undefined.

Output: **! [i * v] (where i is 3 and v is undefined)**
