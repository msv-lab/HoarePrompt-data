Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 3`, `cnt` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1, changing from `k - 2` to `k - 3`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `l`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1` still holds true after the decrement.
