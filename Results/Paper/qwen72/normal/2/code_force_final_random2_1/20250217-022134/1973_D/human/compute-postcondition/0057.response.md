Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 2`, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i` is 2**: The value of `i` remains unchanged throughout the loop because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n` is greater than 0**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 2`**: This condition is part of the initial state and remains unchanged as `k` is only decremented but not modified in any way that would affect this condition.
- **`cnt` is 0**: The loop continues to execute as long as `cnt` is not 0 and `l` is less than `n + 1`. After all iterations, `cnt` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration.
- **`l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`**: The value of `l` is updated in each iteration to `func_2() + 1`. Since the loop continues as long as `l` is less than `n + 1`, `func_2()` must return a value less than `n` for the loop to continue executing. After the final iteration, `l` will be `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`.

This output state reflects the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
