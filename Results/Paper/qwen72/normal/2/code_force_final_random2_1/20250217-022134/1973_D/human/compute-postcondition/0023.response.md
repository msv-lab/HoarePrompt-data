To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`.

- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n // k + 1`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, the upper bound of the range (`n // k + 1`) must be greater than or equal to 1.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`i`**: This variable is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 1.
2. **`n` and `k`**: These variables determine the range of the loop. Specifically, `n // k + 1` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `i` will be 1 (the first value in the range).
- `n` and `k` must be such that `n // k + 1 >= 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` and `k` are set appropriately to allow the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are such that `n // k + 1 >= 1`**
