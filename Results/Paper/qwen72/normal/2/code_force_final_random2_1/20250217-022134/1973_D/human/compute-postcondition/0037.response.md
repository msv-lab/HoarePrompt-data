Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 1`, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l` must be less than `n + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: The value of `i` remains unchanged throughout the loop because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`k`**: The value of `k` determines the initial value of `cnt`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `cnt` is greater than 0 and `l` is less than `n + 1`. After all iterations, `cnt` will be 0.
- **`cnt`**: This variable is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `cnt` will be 0.
- **`l`**: The value of `l` is updated in each iteration to `func_2() + 1`. For the loop to complete all iterations, `l` must always be less than `n + 1` at the start of each iteration. After the loop finishes, `l` will be the result of the last call to `func_2() + 1`.

Thus, the final output state reflects these changes and conditions.
