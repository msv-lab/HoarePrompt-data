The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1. Initially, `cnt` is `k - 2`. After decrementing, `cnt` becomes `(k - 2) - 1`, which simplifies to `k - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` must be greater than 2, `cnt` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`.**
