The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It performs a series of operations involving queries and checks using the functions `func_3` and `func_2`. The function aims to find a specific value `v` by iterating through a range of values and checking conditions. If a certain condition is met, it prints a specific output and terminates. If the condition is not met after all iterations, it prints `! -1` and terminates. The final state of the program is that no value is returned, and the function has printed either a specific value or `! -1`.
