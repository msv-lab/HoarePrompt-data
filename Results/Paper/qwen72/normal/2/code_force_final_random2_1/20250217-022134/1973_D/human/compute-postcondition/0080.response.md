The function `func_2()` is called, but there's no information about what this function does or returns. However, based on the initial state, we know that `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`, and it is also stated that `l` is not equal to `n + 1`. After calling `func_2()`, the value of `l` might change, but without knowing the specifics of `func_2()`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `l`.

However, since the initial state specifies that `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, and given that the function `func_2()` is called again, the value of `l` remains as `func_2() + 1` but the actual value of `func_2()` might change. Since we don't have the details of `func_2()`, we assume it does not change the values of other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `cnt`).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 3`, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**
