The value of `v` is updated to be equal to the current value of `i`. Since `i` is initially set to `n`, and `v` was also initially set to `n`, the value of `v` remains the same. However, the assignment `v = i` explicitly sets `v` to the value of `i`, which is `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `v` is `n`.**
