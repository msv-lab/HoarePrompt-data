Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 3`, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `l = func_2() + 1` updates the value of `l` to be the result of `func_2()` plus 1. Since `l` was already defined as `func_2() + 1` in the initial state, the value of `l` remains unchanged. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `cnt`) and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
