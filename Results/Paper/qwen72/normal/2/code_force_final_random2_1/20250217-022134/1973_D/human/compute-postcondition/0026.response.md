Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 1`.
   - `cnt` is `k`.
   - `l` is 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `l` is 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - The print statement uses a formatted string with two placeholders: `{l}` and `{i * v}`.
   - `{l}` will be replaced by the value of `l`, which is 1.
   - `{i * v}` will be replaced by the value of `i * v`. However, the variable `v` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `v` is not defined, we cannot compute the exact value of `i * v`.
   - Therefore, the output will include the placeholder `{i * v}`.

Output: **? 1 {i * v} (where i is 1 and v is an undefined variable)**
