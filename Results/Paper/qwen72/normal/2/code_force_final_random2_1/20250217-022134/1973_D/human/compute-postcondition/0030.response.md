Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` must be greater than 1.
- `cnt` is `k - 1`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `func_2()` must be less than `n`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**: 
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.

2. **Value of `l`**:
   - `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`.
   - `func_2()` is a function call that returns a value less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `l` will be a value between 1 and `n` (inclusive).

3. **Value of `v`**:
   - The variable `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since it is used in the print statement, we need to assume it is defined elsewhere in the code. For the purpose of this task, we will treat `v` as an unknown but defined value.

4. **Value of `i * v`**:
   - Since `i` is 1, `i * v` simplifies to `v`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output a string in the format `? {l} {v}`, where:
- `{l}` is the value of `func_2() + 1`, which is a number between 1 and `n`.
- `{v}` is the value of `v`.

Output: **? [l] [v] (where l is the value of func_2() + 1, and v is the value of v)**
