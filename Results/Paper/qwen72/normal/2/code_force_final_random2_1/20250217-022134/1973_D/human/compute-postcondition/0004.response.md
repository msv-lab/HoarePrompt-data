To accurately determine the output state, we need to know what `func_2()` returns. However, since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we can only assume its behavior based on typical Python functions.

If `func_2()` returns a specific value, `v` will be updated to that value. Since the return value of `func_2()` is not specified, we will denote it as `return_value`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is `n`
- `v` is 1

After executing the code snippet:
- `v` is now `return_value` (the value returned by `func_2()`)

The other variables (`n` and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `v` is `return_value`**
