To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions in the loop head: `cnt` and `l < n + 1`.

1. **Condition 1: `cnt`**
   - The current state indicates that `cnt` is `k - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute, `cnt` must be non-zero. Since `k` is greater than 1, `k - 2` could be zero or positive. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `k` must be at least 3 (so `k - 2` is at least 1).

2. **Condition 2: `l < n + 1`**
   - The current state indicates that `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Given that `n` is greater than 0, `n + 1` is greater than 1. Therefore, `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

Combining these conditions:
- `cnt` must be at least 1, so `k` must be at least 3.
- `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

Since the current state already indicates that `n` is greater than 0, and `l` is `func_2() + 1`, we need to ensure that `func_2()` returns a value such that `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is at least 3, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l` must be less than `n + 1`**
