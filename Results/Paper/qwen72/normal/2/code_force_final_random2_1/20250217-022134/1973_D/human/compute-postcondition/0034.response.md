To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `k` is at least 3.
   - `cnt` is `k - 2`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

2. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `l` is derived from the function `func_2()` plus 1. Since `l` must be less than `n + 1`, `func_2()` must return a value that, when incremented by 1, is still less than `n + 1`.
   - `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we assume it is a predefined variable or parameter that is available in the context where this code is executed.

3. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and it must be less than `n + 1`.
- `i * v` will be `1 * v`, which simplifies to `v`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output:
- The character `?` followed by a space.
- The value of `l`, which is `func_2() + 1`.
- The value of `v`.

Since `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can describe it as the value of `v`.

Output: **? [func_2() + 1] [v]** (where `func_2()` is the result of the function call and `v` is the value of the variable `v`)
