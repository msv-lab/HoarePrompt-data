Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be at least 1.
- `_` is a throwaway variable.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not non-decreasing.
- `i` is 1.
- `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end.
- `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
- `check_all_new` is `True`.
- `new_all` is `True`.

The code snippet to evaluate is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This code simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Since the initial state does not affect the content of the `print` statement, the output will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
