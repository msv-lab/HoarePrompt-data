To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `_` is a throwaway variable.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `i` is `n-1`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`, then:
     - `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index `n-1` to the end.
     - `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`.
     - `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
   - `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains a simple `print('YES')` statement.

Given the conditions and the initial state, the `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print('YES')` statement is:

Output: **YES**
