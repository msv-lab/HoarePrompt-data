Postcondition: ***`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `n-1`. If `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index `n-1` to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. If `check_all` is `True`, the program maintains the same state as described in the precondition. If `check_all` is `False`, the loop will break if `a[i-1]` is greater than `a[i]` and either `check_all_new` or `new_all` is `False` (or both). If no such condition is met throughout the loop, the loop completes all iterations.***
