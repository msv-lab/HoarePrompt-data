You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `n-1`. For each iteration, if `a` is non-decreasing (`check_all` is `True`), 'YES' is printed. If `a` is not non-decreasing (`check_all` is `False`), the loop checks if the sub-list `new` (starting from the first decrease) is non-decreasing and all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`. If both conditions are met, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The loop iterates `t` times, and the final state reflects the results of these checks for each input list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. The function checks if the list `a` is non-decreasing. If it is, the function prints 'YES'. If not, it checks if the list can be split into two parts such that the second part is non-decreasing and all elements in the second part are less than or equal to the first element of the original list. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This process is repeated for each of the `t` test cases. After processing all test cases, the function has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions described.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `a`.

2. **Initial Check for Sorted Array**: The function checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function with a list comprehension. If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case. This is a valid and efficient check.

3. **Finding the First Out-of-Order Element**: If the array is not already sorted, the function iterates through the array to find the first position where the order is violated (`a[i - 1] > a[i]`). This is a correct approach to identify the point where the array deviates from being sorted.

4. **Splitting and Checking the New Array**: Once the out-of-order element is found, the function splits the array into two parts: `new` (from the out-of-order element to the end) and the remaining part. It then checks two conditions:
   - All elements in `new` should be less than or equal to the first element of the original array (`a[0]`).
   - The elements in `new` should be in non-decreasing order.

5. **Output Based on Conditions**: If both conditions are met, the function prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.

However, there is a logical issue in the implementation:
- The function breaks out of the loop immediately after checking the first out-of-order element. This means it only checks one possible split and does not consider other potential splits that might make the array sorted.

To fix this, the function should continue checking all possible splits until it finds a valid one or exhausts all possibilities.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n))
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            found = False
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:] + a[:i]
                    check_all_new = all(new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, n))
                    if check_all_new:
                        print('YES')
                        found = True
                        break
            if not found:
                print('NO')
```

In this corrected version:
- The function continues to check all possible splits by iterating through the array.
- It constructs the new array by concatenating the suffix and prefix.
- It checks if the new array is sorted.
- If a valid split is found, it prints 'YES' and sets `found` to `True`.
- If no valid split is found after checking all possibilities, it prints 'NO'.

Given the original function's logic, the correctness is **False** because it does not handle all possible splits correctly.

Correctness: **False**
