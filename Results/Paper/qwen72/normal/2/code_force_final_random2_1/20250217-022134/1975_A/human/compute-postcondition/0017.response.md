Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be at least 1.
- `_` is a throwaway variable.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not non-decreasing.
- `i` is 1.
- `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end.
- `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
- `check_all_new` is `False`.
- `new_all` is `False`.
- Either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
