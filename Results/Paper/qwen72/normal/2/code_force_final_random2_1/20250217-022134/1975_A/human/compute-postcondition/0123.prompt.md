Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `n-1`, if `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index `n-1` to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1. If `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, or if either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` (or both), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[0]` is not greater than `a[1]`, the program continues without breaking.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 2. If `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 2 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Regardless of the values of `check_all_new` and `new_all`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[0]` is not greater than `a[1]`, the program continues without breaking.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 3. If `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Regardless of the values of `check_all_new` and `new_all`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[0]` is not greater than `a[1]`, the program continues without breaking.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
