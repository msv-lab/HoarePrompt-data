Postcondition: ***`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not non-decreasing, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end. If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, the most internal loop or if statement is also broken out of.***
