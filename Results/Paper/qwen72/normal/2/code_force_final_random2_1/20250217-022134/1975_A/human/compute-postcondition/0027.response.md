Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be at least 1.
- `_` is a throwaway variable.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not non-decreasing.
- `i` is 2.
- `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 2 to the end.
- `check_all_new` is the result of checking if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`.
- `new_all` is the result of checking if `new` is non-decreasing.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **NO**
