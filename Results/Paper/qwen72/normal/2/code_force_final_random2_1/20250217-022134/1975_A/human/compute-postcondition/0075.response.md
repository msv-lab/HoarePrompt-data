The provided code snippet updates the value of `new_all` based on whether all elements in the list `new` are in non-decreasing order. Let's analyze the impact:

1. **Initial State Recap**:
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `_` is a throwaway variable.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 3.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end.
   - `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
   - `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`.
   - `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
   - `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code snippet `new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])` checks if all elements in the list `new` are in non-decreasing order.
   - This is done by iterating over the list `new` and checking if each element is less than or equal to the next element.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The value of `new_all` is updated based on the result of the check.
   - All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `a[i - 1]`, `a[n-2]`, `a[n-1]`, `check_all_new`, `check_all`) remain unchanged.

4. **Calculation**:
   - The new value of `new_all` will be `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, and `False` otherwise.

5. **Output State**:
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `_` is a throwaway variable.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 3.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end.
   - `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
   - `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`.
   - `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
   - `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 3, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end, `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.**
