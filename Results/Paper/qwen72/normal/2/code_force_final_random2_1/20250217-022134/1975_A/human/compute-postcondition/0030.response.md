Postcondition: ***`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not non-decreasing, `i` is 2. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 2 to the end, `check_all_new` is the result of checking if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, and `new_all` is the result of checking if `new` is non-decreasing. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
