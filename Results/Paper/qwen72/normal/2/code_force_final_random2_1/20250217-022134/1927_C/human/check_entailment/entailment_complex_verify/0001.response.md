### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.
   - These values are stored in a list of tuples `cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` to store the unique elements from arrays `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to `k`, resulting in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.

3. **Set Operations**:
   - The program calculates the elements that are present only in `a` (`only_a`), only in `b` (`only_b`), and in both (`both`).

4. **Validation**:
   - The program checks if the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds `k // 2`. If either condition is true, it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - It also checks if the total number of distinct elements (sum of elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) is less than `k`. If this condition is true, it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it appends 'YES' to the results.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case as described.
- The set operations and validation steps ensure that the program checks the conditions required to determine if it is possible to choose the elements in the required way.
- The logic is sound and follows the problem description accurately.

### Additional Considerations:
- The program ensures that the elements chosen from both arrays cover all integers from 1 to `k` by using set operations to filter and count the relevant elements.
- The conditions checked in the validation step are necessary and sufficient to determine the feasibility of the selection.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **True**
