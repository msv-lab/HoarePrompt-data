Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. The function evaluates each test case to determine if the conditions involving the uniqueness and overlap of elements in `a` and `b` relative to `k` are met. Specifically, it checks if the number of unique elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and do not overlap exceeds `k // 2`, and if the total number of distinct elements (including those that overlap) is at least `k`. If these conditions are met, the function appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. The function returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether the conditions are met. **
