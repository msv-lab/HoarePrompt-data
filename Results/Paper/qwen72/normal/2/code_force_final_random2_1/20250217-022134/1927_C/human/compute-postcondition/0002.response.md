The code snippet `unique_a = set(a)` creates a set from the list `a`. This means that `unique_a` will contain only the unique elements from `a`, and the order of these elements is not guaranteed to be the same as in `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains valid `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as described, and `cases` must have at least one tuple
- `results` is an empty list

After executing the code snippet:
- `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `cases`, `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains valid `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as described, and `cases` must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`.**
