Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It checks for the possibility of selecting exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to \(k\) are included. The logic in the `func_1` function is sound and covers the necessary conditions:

1. It identifies the unique elements in each array that are less than or equal to \(k\).
2. It calculates the elements that are unique to each array and those that are common to both.
3. It checks if the number of unique elements in either array exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\), which would make it impossible to select the required elements.
4. It ensures that the total number of distinct elements (from both arrays) is at least \(k\).

Given these checks, the program should correctly determine whether it is possible to select the required elements for all valid inputs. No edge cases or logical flaws have been identified that would cause the program to fail.
