Output State: **The program returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `cases`. Each 'YES' indicates that the conditions for the corresponding test case are met, while each 'NO' indicates that they are not. The conditions involve checking the uniqueness and overlap of elements in lists `a` and `b` relative to the value `k`.**
