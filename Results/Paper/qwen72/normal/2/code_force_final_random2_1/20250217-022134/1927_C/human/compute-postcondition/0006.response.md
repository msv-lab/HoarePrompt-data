Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains valid `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as described, and `cases` must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`.** 

Explanation: The variable `only_a` is assigned the result of the set difference between `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. This means `only_a` now contains all elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
