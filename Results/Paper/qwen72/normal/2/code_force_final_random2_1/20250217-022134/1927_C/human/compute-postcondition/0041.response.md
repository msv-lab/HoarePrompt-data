The code appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. This impacts the `results` list by adding a new element to it. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains valid `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as described, and `cases` must have at least two tuples, `results` is a list containing the strings 'NO', 'YES', and 'YES', `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. If `total_distinct` is less than `k`, all variables remain unchanged, and the program continues execution from the next line.**
