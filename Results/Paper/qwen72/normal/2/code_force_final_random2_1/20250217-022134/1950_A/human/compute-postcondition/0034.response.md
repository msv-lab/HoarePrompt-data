To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions:

1. **Variables and Their Ranges:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits where \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive).
   - `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive).
   - `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive).

2. **Conditions for `res`:**
   - If `x` < `y`:
     - If `y` > `z`, `res` is 'peak'.
     - If `y` < `z`, `res` is 'stair'.
     - If `y` == `z`, `res` is 'none'.
   - If `x` >= `y`, `res` is 'none'.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement will print the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` separated by spaces.

Given the conditions, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are random integers between 1 and 9. The specific values of these variables will be determined at runtime, but we can describe their possible ranges.

### Explanation:
- `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9.
- `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9.
- `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9.

Since the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are random, we cannot predict their exact values. However, we know they will be integers within the specified range.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output three integers separated by spaces, where each integer is a random value between 1 and 9.

Output: **x y z (where x, y, and z are random integers between 1 and 9)**
