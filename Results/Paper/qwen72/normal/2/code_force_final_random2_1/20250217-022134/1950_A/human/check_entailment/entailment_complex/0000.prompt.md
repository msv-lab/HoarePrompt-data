Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
from random import randint

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are digits where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        
        print(res)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, `i` is 1001, `x`, `y`, and `z` are random integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) for each iteration. For each iteration, if `x` < `y`, then: if `y` > `z`, `res` is 'peak'; if `y` < `z`, `res` is 'stair'; if `y` == `z`, `res` is 'none'. If `x` >= `y`, `res` is 'none'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` generates 1000 sets of three random digits (x, y, z) between 1 and 9, inclusive. For each set, it determines a string `res` based on the relationship between x, y, and z: if x < y and y > z, `res` is 'peak'; if x < y and y < z, `res` is 'stair'; otherwise, `res` is 'none'. The function prints each set of digits followed by the corresponding `res` string. After 1000 iterations, the function completes without returning any value. The final state is that `i` is 1001, and the program has printed 1000 lines of digit sets and their corresponding results.
