You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` generates 1000 sets of three random digits (x, y, z) between 1 and 9, inclusive. For each set, it determines a string `res` based on the relationship between x, y, and z: if x < y and y > z, `res` is 'peak'; if x < y and y < z, `res` is 'stair'; otherwise, `res` is 'none'. The function prints each set of digits followed by the corresponding `res` string. After 1000 iterations, the function completes without returning any value. The final state is that `i` is 1001, and the program has printed 1000 lines of digit sets and their corresponding results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The given program does not read input from the user or stdin, which is required according to the problem statement. The problem specifies that the program should handle multiple test cases, but the program generates random test cases instead of reading them from input.

2. **Test Case Generation**: The program uses `randint(1, 9)` to generate random digits for each test case. This is not aligned with the problem's requirement to read the digits from input. The problem specifies that the digits can range from 0 to 9, but the program only generates digits from 1 to 9.

3. **Logic for Stair and Peak**: The logic for determining whether the digits form a stair or a peak is partially correct:
   - It correctly identifies a peak when `x < y` and `y > z`.
   - It correctly identifies a stair when `x < y` and `y < z`.
   - However, it incorrectly sets `res` to 'none' in all other cases, including when `x >= y`.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the generated digits and the result, but it does not follow the required output format. The problem requires the output to be "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case, without any additional information.

5. **Loop Control**: The loop runs 1000 times, which is more than necessary. The problem specifies that the number of test cases `t` can be up to 1000, but the program always runs 1000 times regardless of the actual number of test cases.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
