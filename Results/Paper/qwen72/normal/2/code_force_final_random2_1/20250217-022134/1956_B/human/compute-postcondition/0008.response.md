To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is at least 1.
- The input file has at least seven lines.
- `line` is the fourth line of input data for the second test case.
- `elements` is a list of substrings from `line` split by whitespace.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `line` and `elements`:**
   - `line` is the fourth line of input data for the second test case. This means if the input file has multiple test cases, `line` refers to the fourth line of the second test case.
   - `elements` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `line` by whitespace. For example, if `line` is `"a b c a b c a"`, then `elements` would be `['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'a']`.

2. **Set Comprehension `{*elements}`:**
   - `{*elements}` creates a set of unique elements from the list `elements`. For example, if `elements` is `['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'a']`, then `{*elements}` would be `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`.

3. **Counting Occurrences and Integer Division:**
   - `elements.count(item)` counts how many times each unique element appears in the list `elements`.
   - `// 3` performs integer division by 3, which means it divides the count by 3 and takes the floor of the result.

4. **Summing the Results:**
   - The generator expression `sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements})` iterates over each unique element in `elements`, counts its occurrences, divides the count by 3, and sums these results.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `line` is `"a b c a b c a"`. Then:
- `elements` = `['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'a']`
- `{*elements}` = `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`
- `elements.count('a')` = 3
- `elements.count('b')` = 2
- `elements.count('c')` = 2

Now, calculate the integer division:
- `3 // 3` = 1
- `2 // 3` = 0
- `2 // 3` = 0

Summing these results:
- `1 + 0 + 0` = 1

### Final Output:
The code will print the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique element in `elements` by 3.

Output: **1 (where 1 is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique element in `elements` by 3)**
