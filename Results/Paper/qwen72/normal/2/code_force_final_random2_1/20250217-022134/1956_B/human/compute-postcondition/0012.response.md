Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, and `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`.
- The code snippet `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0.
- No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions and adds that `ans` is 0.
