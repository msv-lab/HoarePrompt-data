Output State: **`n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the new input with all its elements processed, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `ans` is `2 * max(0, x - 1) + max(0, x - 1)`, and `x` is the third element in `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `max(0, x - 1)` to its current value.
- The current value of `ans` is `2 * max(0, x - 1)`.
- After the addition, `ans` becomes `2 * max(0, x - 1) + max(0, x - 1)`, which simplifies to `3 * max(0, x - 1)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `cnt`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
