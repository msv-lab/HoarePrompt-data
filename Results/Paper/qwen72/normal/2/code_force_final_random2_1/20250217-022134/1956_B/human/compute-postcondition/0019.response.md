Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: Remains the same as it was initially, an input integer greater than 0.
- **`a`**: Remains the same as it was initially, a list of integers from the input.
- **`cnt`**: Remains the same as it was initially, a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`.
- **`ans`**: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` is updated to the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`. This means that for each count `x` in the `cnt` list, if `x` is greater than 1, `x - 1` is added to `ans`. If `x` is 1 or less, 0 is added to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will be the total number of elements in `a` that appear more than once, minus the number of unique elements.
