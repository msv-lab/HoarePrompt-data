The value of `prod` is updated by multiplying its current value by the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `prod` is now equal to `a[0] * a[1]`. The values of `t`, `T`, `bets`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `T` is 0, `bets` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `prod` is `a[0] * a[1]`, `i` is 1**
