Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `T` is 0, `bets` is the number of iterations, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` has been updated to `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `prod` is the product of all original elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of all updated elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is an empty string.**
