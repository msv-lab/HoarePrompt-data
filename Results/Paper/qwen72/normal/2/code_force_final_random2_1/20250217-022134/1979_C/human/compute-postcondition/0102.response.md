The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `bets`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `bets` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 2), and `bets` must still be greater than `i` (so `bets` must be greater than 2).

State: **`i` is 2, `bets` must be greater than 2, `ans` is updated to include the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space, and now also includes the string representation of `a[1]` followed by a space.**
