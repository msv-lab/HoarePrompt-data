The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `bets`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `bets` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `bets` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`bets` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is updated to include the string representation of the first element of `a` followed by a space.**
