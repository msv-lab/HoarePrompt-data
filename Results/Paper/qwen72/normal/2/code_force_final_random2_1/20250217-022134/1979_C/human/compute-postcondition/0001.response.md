To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `T` and `t`.

- `T` is the loop variable that will iterate over the range defined by `t`.
- `t` is the number of test cases, and it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1, and `T` should start at 0 (the first value in the range).

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `T` is 0**
