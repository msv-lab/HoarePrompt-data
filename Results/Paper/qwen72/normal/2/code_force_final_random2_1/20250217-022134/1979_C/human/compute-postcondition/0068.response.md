Output State: **`t` remains at least 1, `T` remains 1, `bets` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers where each element from index 0 to `bets - 1` has been updated to `prod // a[i]`, `i` is 2, `sumo` is the sum of the updated elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space, the string representation of `a[1]` followed by a space, and the string representation of `a[2]` followed by a space.**
