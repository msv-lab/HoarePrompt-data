Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. The main issue lies in how the function `func_1` processes the commands and computes the products. According to the problem statement, for each command, the program should:

1. Output the remainder of the product of all elements of the current array `a` when divided by `m`.
2. Remove the appropriate element from the array based on the command ('L' for leftmost, 'R' for rightmost).

However, the function `func_1` incorrectly appends the elements to be removed to a list `b` and then computes the cumulative product of these elements in reverse order. This approach does not match the requirement to output the remainder of the product of the current array before removing any element.

To fix this, the function should maintain the product of the current array and update it accordingly after each removal. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        # Compute the product of the current array
        for j in range(l, r + 1):
            product = (product * a[j]) % m
        b.append(product)
        
        # Remove the appropriate element based on the command
        if s[i] == 'L':
            l += 1
        else:
            r -= 1
        
        # Reset the product for the next iteration
        product = 1
    
    return b
```

This corrected function maintains the product of the current array and updates it after each command, ensuring that the output matches the problem requirements.

Given the original program's incorrect implementation, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
