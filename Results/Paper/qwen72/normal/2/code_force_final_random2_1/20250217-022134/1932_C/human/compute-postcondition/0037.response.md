Output State: **The program returns the reversed list `ans`, which contains the cumulative products of the elements in the reversed list `b`. Each element in `b` is selected from the list `a` based on the corresponding character in the string `s` ('L' means taking from the left end of `a`, 'R' means taking from the right end of `a'). The final list `ans` is calculated as the cumulative products of these elements in reverse order.**
