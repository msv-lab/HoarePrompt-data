Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is selected from `a` based on the corresponding character in `s` ('L' means taking from the left end of `a`, 'R' means taking from the right end of `a'), `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements in the reversed `b`, `p` is the product of all elements in the reversed `b`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the elements in `b` in reverse order.
- For each element `v` in the reversed `b`, the variable `p` is updated by multiplying it with `v`.
- The result of each multiplication is appended to the list `ans`.
- After all iterations, `p` will contain the product of all elements in the reversed `b`.
- The list `ans` will contain the cumulative products of the elements in the reversed `b`, starting from the last element to the first element of `b`.
