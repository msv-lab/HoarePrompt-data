### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the appropriate arguments.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements removed from `a` based on the commands.
   - **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates `n` times, processing each command in `s`:
     - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments the left pointer `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements the right pointer `r`.
   - **Cumulative Product Calculation**: After processing all commands, the function calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order and stores the results in `ans`.
   - **Return Value**: The function returns the reversed list `ans`, which contains the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in the correct order.

4. **Output**: The main loop prints the results for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Product Calculation**: The program does not take the modulus `m` during the product calculation, which can lead to overflow issues for large values of `n` and `m`. This is a critical error because the problem requires the remainder of the product when divided by `m`.

### Corrected Function:
To fix the issue, the product should be taken modulo `m` at each step to prevent overflow and ensure correctness.

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = (p * v) % m  # Take modulus at each step
        ans.append(p)
    
    return reversed(ans)
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original program does not correctly handle the modulus operation during the product calculation, which is essential for the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
