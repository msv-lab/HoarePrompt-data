You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is selected from `a` based on the corresponding character in `s` ('L' means taking from the left end of `a`, 'R' means taking from the right end of `a'), `l` is `n`, and `r` is `-1`.
    ans = []

    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v

    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is selected from `a` based on the corresponding character in `s` ('L' means taking from the left end of `a`, 'R' means taking from the right end of `a'), `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements in the reversed `b`, `p` is the product of all elements in the reversed `b`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the reversed list `ans`, which contains the cumulative products of the elements in the reversed list `b`. Each element in `b` is selected from the list `a` based on the corresponding character in the string `s` ('L' means taking from the left end of `a`, 'R' means taking from the right end of `a'). The final list `ans` is calculated as the cumulative products of these elements in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a list `ans` which contains the cumulative products of elements selected from `a` based on the instructions in `s`. Specifically, for each character in `s`, if the character is 'L', an element is taken from the left end of `a`; if the character is 'R', an element is taken from the right end of `a`. These elements are then used to compute the cumulative products in reverse order, and the resulting list is returned in its original order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly compute the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` before removing an element. Instead, it appends the element to be removed to the list `b` and then computes the product in reverse order. This approach fails to meet the requirement of computing the product of the current state of the array `a` before each removal.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 2 4 1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
24 24 8 1
```

The actual output is incorrect because the program does not compute the product of the current state of the array before each removal. For example, after the first command 'L', the array becomes `[1, 4, 2]`, and the product should be `8 % 6 = 2`, but the program incorrectly outputs `24`.
