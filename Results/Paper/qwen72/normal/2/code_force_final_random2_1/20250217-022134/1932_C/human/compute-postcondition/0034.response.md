The value of `p` is updated by multiplying its current value with the value of `v`. Since `p` was initially the product of the first two elements in the reversed `b`, and `v` is the third element in the reversed `b`, the new value of `p` is the product of the first three elements in the reversed `b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is selected from `a` based on the corresponding character in `s`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing `v` and `p`, `p` is the product of the first three elements in the reversed `b`, `v` is the third element in the reversed `b`.**
