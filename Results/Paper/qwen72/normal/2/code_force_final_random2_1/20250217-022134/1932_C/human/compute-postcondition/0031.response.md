The value of `p` is updated by multiplying its current value by `v`. Since `v` is the next element in the reversed `b`, and `p` was initially set to `v`, the new value of `p` is the product of the two consecutive elements in the reversed `b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is selected from `a` based on the corresponding character in `s` ('L' means taking from the left end of `a`, 'R' means taking from the right end of `a'), `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing `v`, `p` is the product of the first two elements in the reversed `b`, `v` is the second element in the reversed `b`.**
