Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a list `ans` which contains the cumulative products of elements selected from `a` based on the instructions in `s`. Specifically, for each character in `s`, if the character is 'L', an element is taken from the left end of `a`; if the character is 'R', an element is taken from the right end of `a`. These elements are then used to compute the cumulative products in reverse order, and the resulting list is returned in its original order. **
