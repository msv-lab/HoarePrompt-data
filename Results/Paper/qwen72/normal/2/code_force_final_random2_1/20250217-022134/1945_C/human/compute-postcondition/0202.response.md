The code snippet `final.sort()` sorts the list `final` in ascending order. This operation does not affect the values of any other variables or the conditions specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the information from the initial state, with the only change being that `final` is now sorted.

Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `mini` remains the minimum value between its original value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. `lst` is a non-empty list, and `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, and `final` is now sorted in ascending order. The variables `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc` remain empty lists, and `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, and `o` remain unchanged.**
