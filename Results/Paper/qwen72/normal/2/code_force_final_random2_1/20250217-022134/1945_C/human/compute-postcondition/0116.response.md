Output State: **`lst` must contain at least two elements, `ele` is the second element in `lst`, `mini` is now the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. The other conditions (`lst` containing at least two elements and `ele` being the second element in `lst`) remain unchanged.
