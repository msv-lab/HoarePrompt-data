To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder used in Python to indicate that the value is not needed within the loop body, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The placeholder `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is not a state that affects the loop's execution.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
