The code snippet `final.append(elem)` adds the element `elem` to the list `final`. Given the initial conditions, `elem` is the third element in `lst`, and `final` is initially an empty list unless the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`. In that case, `final` already contains `elem`.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `lst` must contain at least three elements.
   - `elem` is the third element in `lst`.
   - `mini` is the minimum of its initial value \(10^8\) and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`.
   - `t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `c1` remain unchanged.
   - If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` is a list containing `elem`. Otherwise, `final` remains an empty list.

2. **Code Impact**:
   - `final.append(elem)` adds `elem` to the list `final`.

3. **Result**:
   - If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` was already a list containing `elem`. After executing `final.append(elem)`, `final` will now contain `elem` twice.
   - If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is not equal to `mini`, `final` was initially an empty list. After executing `final.append(elem)`, `final` will now contain `elem`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`lst` must contain at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its initial value \(10^8\) and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `c1` remain unchanged. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` is a list containing `elem` twice. Otherwise, `final` is a list containing `elem` once.**
