Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 0, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0' and `one` is 0, otherwise `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates `one_perc` using the formula `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.
- `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`.
- `one` is 0 or 1 depending on whether the character at index `i` in `s` is '1'.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `i` is 0.
- The calculation of `one_perc` involves subtracting `one` from `o`, multiplying by 100, and dividing by `(n - i - 1)`, then taking the ceiling of the result.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
