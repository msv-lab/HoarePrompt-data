Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop, `mini` remains the minimum value between its original value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. `lst` is a non-empty list, and `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, and `final` is now sorted in ascending order. The variables `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc` remain empty lists, and `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, and `o` remain unchanged. Additionally, the length of `final` is 0.**
