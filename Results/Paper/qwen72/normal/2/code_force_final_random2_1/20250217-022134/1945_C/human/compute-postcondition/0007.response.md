The value of `pk` is assigned the result of `n // 2`, which means `pk` is the integer division of `n` by 2. Since `n` is an odd integer, the result of `n // 2` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and is odd, `s` is an input string, `pk` is the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2`.**
