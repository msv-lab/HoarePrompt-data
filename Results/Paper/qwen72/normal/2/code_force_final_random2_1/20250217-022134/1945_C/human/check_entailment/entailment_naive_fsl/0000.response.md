Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in how it calculates the satisfaction percentage for the left and right sides. Specifically, the lines:

```python
zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
```

These lines calculate the percentage of satisfied residents, but the problem description requires that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied, not that the percentage of satisfied residents is at least 50%. For example, if there are 3 houses on the left side and 2 of them are satisfied, the program should consider this valid because 2 is more than half of 3. However, the program incorrectly checks if the percentage is at least 50%, which fails in cases where the number of houses is odd.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the road is placed before the first house or after the last house correctly. The program should check if placing the road before the first house or after the last house satisfies the condition, but it does not do so in a way that aligns with the problem description.

A specific test case where the program fails is:
```
Input:
1
5
01010
```
Expected Output:
```
2
```
Actual Output:
```
0
```
In this case, placing the road after the second house (i = 2) results in 2 houses on the left side (both wanting to live on the left) and 3 houses on the right side (2 wanting to live on the right). This satisfies the condition, but the program incorrectly outputs 0.
