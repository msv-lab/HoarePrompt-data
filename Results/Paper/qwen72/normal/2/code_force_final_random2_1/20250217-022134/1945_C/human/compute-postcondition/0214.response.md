Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a binary string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates the position in the string where the cumulative percentage of '0's and '1's from the start to that position is at least 50% for both '0's and '1's. It then finds the position closest to the middle of the string (`n // 2`) that satisfies this condition and prints it. If no such position exists, it prints 0 if the overall percentage of '1's in the string is at least 50%, otherwise it prints `n`. The function processes up to 2·10^4 test cases, with the total length of all strings not exceeding 3·10^5. **
