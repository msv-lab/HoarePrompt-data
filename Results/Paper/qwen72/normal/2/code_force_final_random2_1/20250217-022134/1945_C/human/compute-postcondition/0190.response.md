Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`; `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `final` is an empty list, `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, `o` remain unchanged.** 

Explanation: The code initializes `final` as an empty list. This change does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. The value of `mini` remains as described in the initial state, and all other variables (`zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, `o`) remain unchanged.
