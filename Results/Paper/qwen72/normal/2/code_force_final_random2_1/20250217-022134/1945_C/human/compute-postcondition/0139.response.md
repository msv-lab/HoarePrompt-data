The code snippet `final.append(n)` adds the value of `n` to the list `final`. Since the initial state specifies that `final` is an empty list, after executing the code, `final` will contain one element, which is the value of `n`.

Output State: **`lst` contains at least as many elements as the number of iterations executed, `mini` is the minimum of its initial value \(10^8\) and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini` plus the value of `n`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `c1` remain unchanged, `c1` is equal to `o * 100 // n`, and `c1` is less than 50.**
