The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `n - 1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `n - 1` is at least 1, so the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 1, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0' and `one` is 0, otherwise `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. If `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, `lst` is a list containing the value `[1]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.**
