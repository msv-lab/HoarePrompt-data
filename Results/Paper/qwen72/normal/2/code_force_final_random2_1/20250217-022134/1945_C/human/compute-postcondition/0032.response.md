The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given the initial state, let's determine the updated state:

- `i` is 1.
- `lst` initially contains `[1]` if both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50, otherwise it is an empty list.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `i + 1`:**
   - `i` is 1, so `i + 1` is 2.

2. **Update `lst`:**
   - If `lst` was initially `[1]`, appending `2` results in `lst` becoming `[1, 2]`.
   - If `lst` was initially an empty list, appending `2` results in `lst` becoming `[2]`.

### Output State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1.
- `s` is an input string.
- `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd.
- `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`.
- `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`.
- `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`.
- `mini` is 100000000.
- `i` is 1.
- `zero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 otherwise.
- `one` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0' and 1 otherwise.
- `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.
- `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.
- `lst` is now `[1, 2]` if both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50, otherwise `lst` is `[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 1, `zero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `one` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0' and 1 otherwise, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is `[1, 2]` if both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50, otherwise `lst` is `[2]`.**
