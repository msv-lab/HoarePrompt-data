Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` is a new input integer greater than 2, `s` is a new input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is \(10^8\), `i` is 1, `zero` is 1 if the first character of `s` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `one` is 0 if the first character of `s` is '0' and 1 otherwise, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` remains unchanged, and `lst` contains the element 1 if the conditions for `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are met.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `zero_perc` to `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The value of `zero_perc` is now calculated based on the current values of `zero` and `i`.
- The conditions for `zero_perc` and `one_perc` remain as described, and `i` and `lst` will only be updated if these conditions are met.
