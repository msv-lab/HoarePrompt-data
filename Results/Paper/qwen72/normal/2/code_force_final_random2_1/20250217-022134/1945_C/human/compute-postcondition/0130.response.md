The code snippet `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Given the initial conditions, `elem` is the third element in `lst`, and `final` is initially an empty list unless the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, in which case `final` already contains `elem`.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **`final`**: Initially, `final` is an empty list or contains `elem` if the condition was met. After executing the code, `elem` is appended to `final`.
2. **Other Variables**: All other variables (`lst`, `mini`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `c1`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`lst` must contain at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its initial value \(10^8\) and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `c1` remain unchanged. `final` is a list containing `elem`.**
