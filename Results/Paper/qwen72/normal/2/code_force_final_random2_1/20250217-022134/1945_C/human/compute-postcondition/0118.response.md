Output State: **`lst` must contain at least three elements, `ele` is the third element in `lst`, `mini` is now the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element in `lst`.** 

Explanation: The value of `mini` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele` (which is the third element in `lst`). The other conditions remain unchanged.
