Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 0, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0' and `one` is 0, otherwise `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.** 

Explanation: The variable `zero_perc` is calculated using the formula `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. Given that `i` is 0, the denominator `(i + 1)` is 1. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0, making `zero_perc` equal to `math.ceil(1 * 100 / 1)`, which is 100. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not '0', `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1, making `zero_perc` equal to `math.ceil(0 * 100 / 1)`, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
