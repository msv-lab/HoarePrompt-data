Postcondition: ***`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. `lst` is a non-empty list with at least three elements, and `elem` is the third element in `lst`. `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `final` are lists. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` includes the third element of `lst` (`elem`). Additionally, if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element is equal to `mini`, `final` also contains the first element of `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element is equal to `mini`, `final` also contains the second element of `lst`. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element is equal to `mini`, `final` contains the first element of `lst`. `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, and `o` remain unchanged.***
