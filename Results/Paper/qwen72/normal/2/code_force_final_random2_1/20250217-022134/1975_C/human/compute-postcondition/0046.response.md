Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n-1`, and `max` is the maximum of the initial `max` and the minimum value between `a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`. If the minimum value between `a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to this minimum value.***
