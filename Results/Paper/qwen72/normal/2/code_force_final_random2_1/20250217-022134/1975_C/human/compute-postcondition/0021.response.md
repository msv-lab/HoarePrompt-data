To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the range `range(1, n)` is non-empty. This means `n` must be greater than 1.
3. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `i` is `n-1` (this is not relevant to the loop head, as `i` will be reinitialized by the loop).
   - `max` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head).

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n` must be greater than 1**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.
- **`i` is initialized by the loop**: The loop will initialize `i` starting from 1, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

### Final State:
The only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is greater than 1. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `i`, and `max`) do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `max` is 0**
