Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 3, and `max` is the minimum value between `a[3]` and `a[2]` if `min(a[3], a[2]) > max`. Otherwise, `max` remains the same as it was after the previous iteration (either 0 or the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[1]`).***
