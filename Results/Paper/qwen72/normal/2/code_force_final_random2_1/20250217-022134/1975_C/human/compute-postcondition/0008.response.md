Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1. If the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is greater than `max` (which is initially 0), then `max` is updated to the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0]`. Otherwise, `max` remains 0.***
