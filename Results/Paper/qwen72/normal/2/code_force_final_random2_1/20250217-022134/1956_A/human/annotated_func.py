#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100, and b is a list of integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 100.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program returns an error because the operation `a - 1` is not valid for a list `a`. The subtraction operator cannot be applied directly to a list of integers.
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns the list `b`, which is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100, inclusive. The list `a` is greater than the list `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two lists of integers, `a` and `b`. It returns the list `b` if `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`. If `a` is lexicographically less than or equal to `b`, the function attempts an invalid operation (`a - 1`), which results in an error. The function does not modify the input lists `a` or `b`.
