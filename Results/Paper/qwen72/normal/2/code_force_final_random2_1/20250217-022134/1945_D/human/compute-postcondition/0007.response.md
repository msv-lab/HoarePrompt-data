Output State: **`numero_testes` is a positive integer such that 0 < `numero_testes` <= 10^4, and the loop has completed all `numero_testes` iterations.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `numero_testes` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `numero_testes`. The loop simply runs `numero_testes` times, and since the loop completes, it confirms that `numero_testes` was a positive integer within the specified range (1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4). The placeholder `_` is used in the loop but does not affect any state outside the loop.
