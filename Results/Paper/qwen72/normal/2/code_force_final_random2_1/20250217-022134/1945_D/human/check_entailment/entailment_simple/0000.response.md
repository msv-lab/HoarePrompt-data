Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case using `func_2()`. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`.

2. **Reversing Lists**: The program reverses both `lista_A` and `lista_B`. This is a crucial step because it allows the program to process the elements from the end of the queue (where Kirill starts) to the front, which aligns with the problem's requirement.

3. **Initial Loop (for i in range(n - k))**:
   - The loop iterates from the end of the queue to the position just before the `k`-th position.
   - It calculates the cost of moving Kirill to a position `j` where `j < i` by comparing `a_i` and `b_i`.
   - If `a_i` is less than `b_i`, it adds the cumulative cost of `b` values (`soma_b`) and `a_i` to `pref`, and resets `soma_b` to 0.
   - If `a_i` is greater than or equal to `b_i`, it adds `b_i` to `soma_b`.

4. **Second Loop (for i in range(n - k, n))**:
   - This loop iterates from the position just before the `k`-th position to the start of the queue.
   - It calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position within the first `k` positions by considering the current `pref` and `soma_b` values, plus the cost of moving to the current position `a_i`.
   - It updates `soma_b` with the current `b_i` value.

5. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is stored in `resultado`.

The logic and steps taken in the program align with the problem statement and constraints. The program correctly handles the input, processes the costs, and outputs the minimum cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
