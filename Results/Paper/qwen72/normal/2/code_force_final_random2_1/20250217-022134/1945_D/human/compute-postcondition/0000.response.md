The value of `numero_testes` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. Since the initial state specifies that `numero_testes` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, the new value of `numero_testes` must also satisfy this condition.

Output State: **`numero_testes` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4, and it is set to the integer value provided by the user input.**
