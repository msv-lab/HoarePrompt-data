The code snippet `pref += lista_A[i]` updates the value of `pref` by adding the value of `lista_A[i]` to its current value. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `n` is greater than `k`.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
- `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`.
- `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`.
- If `lista_A[1] < lista_B[1]`, then `pref` is equal to the first element of `lista_A`, and `soma_b` remains 0.
- Otherwise, `soma_b` is equal to the first element of `lista_B`, and `pref` is equal to the first element of `lista_B`.

Given that `i` is 1, the code `pref += lista_A[i]` will add the second element of `lista_A` (since indexing starts at 0) to the current value of `pref`.

Therefore, the updated value of `pref` will be the sum of its initial value and the second element of `lista_A`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `pref` is the sum of its initial value and the second element of `lista_A`, `soma_b` remains 0 if `lista_A[1] < lista_B[1]`, otherwise `soma_b` is the first element of `lista_B`.**
