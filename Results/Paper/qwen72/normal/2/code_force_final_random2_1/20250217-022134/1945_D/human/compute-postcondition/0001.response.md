The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `numero_testes`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `numero_testes`. For the loop to execute, `numero_testes` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be initialized to a specific value.

Since `numero_testes` is already defined as a positive integer (1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4) and is set to the integer value provided by the user input, no adjustment is needed for `numero_testes` to ensure the loop executes. However, to explicitly state the condition for the loop to execute, we can rephrase the state as follows:

State: **`numero_testes` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4, and it is set to the integer value provided by the user input, `_` is a placeholder and does not need initialization.**
