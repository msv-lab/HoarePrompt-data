The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `numero_testes`. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not carry any specific state information; it simply iterates over the range defined by `numero_testes`. For the loop to execute one more time, `numero_testes` must be greater than the current value of the iteration count.

At the end of the last iteration, `numero_testes` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4, and it is set to the integer value provided by the user input. Since `_` is a placeholder, its value is not relevant for the state adjustment. However, for the loop to execute one more time, the iteration count (which is implicitly managed by the `range` function) must be less than `numero_testes`.

Since the loop has already run once, the remaining number of iterations is `numero_testes - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `numero_testes` must still be greater than the current iteration count, which is 1.

State: **`numero_testes` is a positive integer such that 1 < `numero_testes` <= 10^4**
