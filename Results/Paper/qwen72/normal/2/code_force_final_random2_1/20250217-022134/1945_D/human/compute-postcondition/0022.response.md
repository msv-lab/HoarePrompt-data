The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i`, and the expression `n - k`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n - k` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`. If `lista_A[1] < lista_B[1]`, then `pref` is the sum of its initial value and the second element of `lista_A`, and `soma_b` remains 0. Otherwise, `soma_b` is the sum of the first element of `lista_B` and `lista_B[1]`, and `pref` is 0.**
