The code `nums.remove(1 << idx)` removes the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from the list `nums`. Let's analyze the impact of this operation step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is the first input positive integer.
   - `k` is the second input positive integer.
   - `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with three additional elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` (before appending) that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such power of 2 exists.
   - `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` (before appending) that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` (before appending) if no such element exists.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed from the list `nums`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - The value \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed from `nums`.
   - The list `nums` is updated to reflect this removal.

4. **Output State**:
   - `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` remains the first input positive integer.
   - `k` remains the second input positive integer.
   - `nums` is now the list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) removed, and the three additional elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - `idx` remains the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` (before appending) that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such power of 2 exists.
   - `i` remains the index of the first element in `nums` (before appending) that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` (before appending) if no such element exists.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input positive integer, `k` is the second input positive integer, `nums` is the list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) removed and the three additional elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` (before appending) that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such power of 2 exists, `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` (before appending) that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` (before appending) if no such element exists.**
