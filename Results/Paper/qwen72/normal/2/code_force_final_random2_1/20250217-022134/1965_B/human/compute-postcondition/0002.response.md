The code snippet creates a list named `nums` using a list comprehension. Each element in the list is calculated as `1 << i` for `i` ranging from 0 to 20. The left shift operation `1 << i` is equivalent to `2**i`, so `nums` will contain the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer

After executing the code:
- `nums` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]

The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]**.
