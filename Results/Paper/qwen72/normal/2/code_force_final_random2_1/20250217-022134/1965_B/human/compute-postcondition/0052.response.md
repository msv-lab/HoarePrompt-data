Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input positive integer, `k` is the second input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` is -1, `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such element exists.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `idx` to -1.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- `idx` is now explicitly set to -1, which means it no longer holds the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`. Instead, it is reset to -1.
