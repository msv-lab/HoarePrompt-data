The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function should accept parameters to handle the described logic. The function likely needs to accept at least three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`.

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.

The function's output is not explicitly described, but typically in such scenarios, the function would return a result for each test case, possibly a list of results.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 1000). For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers (2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n). The function returns a result for each test case, likely a list of results.**
