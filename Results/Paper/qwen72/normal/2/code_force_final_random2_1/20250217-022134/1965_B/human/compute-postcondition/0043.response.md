The code appends the value `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. This impacts the list `nums` by adding a new element at the end. The value added is the difference between `k` and the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` appended, `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists, `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such element exists.**
