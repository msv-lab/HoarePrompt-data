The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums` and the value of `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `nums` is a list of powers of 2 that must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `nums` must still have at least two elements (since `i` is now 2).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 that must have at least two elements, `i` is 2, `idx` remains -1**.
