Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 that must have at least two elements, `i` is 2, and `idx` remains -1 unless `nums[2] > k`, in which case `idx` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
