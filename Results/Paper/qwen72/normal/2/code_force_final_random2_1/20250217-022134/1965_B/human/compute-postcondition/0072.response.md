To determine what will be printed by the `print(*nums)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `nums` list step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is the first input positive integer.
- `k` is the second input positive integer.
- `nums` is initially the list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).

### Construction of `nums`:
1. **Initial List of Powers of 2:**
   - `nums` starts as `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.

2. **Determine `idx`:**
   - `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` (before appending) that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such power of 2 exists.
   - For example, if `k = 10`, then `idx` would be 3 because \(2^3 = 8\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 10.

3. **Remove Element at `idx`:**
   - If `idx` is valid (not -1), remove the element at index `idx` from `nums`.
   - For example, if `idx = 3`, then `nums` becomes `[1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.

4. **Append Additional Elements:**
   - Append `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`.
   - For example, if `k = 10` and `idx = 3`, then append `10 - 8 = 2`, `10 + 1 = 11`, and `10 + 8 + 1 = 19` to `nums`.
   - `nums` becomes `[1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2, 11, 19]`.

5. **Determine `i`:**
   - `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` (before appending) that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` (before appending) if no such element exists.
   - For example, if `k = 10`, then `i` would be 4 because the first element greater than 10 in the original `nums` list is 16.

### Final `nums` List:
- The final `nums` list will contain the initial powers of 2 (with one removed if applicable), followed by the three additional elements appended.

### Output:
The `print(*nums)` statement will print the elements of the `nums` list separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 4 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 2 11 19 (where the specific values depend on the values of `k` and `idx`)**

Note: The exact values in the output will vary depending on the specific values of `k` and `idx`. The provided example assumes `k = 10` and `idx = 3`.
