Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input positive integer, `k` is the second input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` is 0, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, `idx`, and `i` remain unchanged, but the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or conditional block it is currently executing within.
