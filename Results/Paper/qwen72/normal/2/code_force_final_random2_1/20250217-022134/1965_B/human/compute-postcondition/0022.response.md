To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(nums))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k - nums[idx], k + 1, k + nums[idx] + 1]` with the element `1 << idx` removed.
   - `idx` is the index of the largest number in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such number exists.
   - `i` is the index of `k + 1` in the updated list `nums`.

2. **Understanding the List `nums`:**
   - The list `nums` initially contains powers of 2 from 1 to 1048576.
   - Additional elements are added: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - The element `1 << idx` is removed from the list.

3. **Finding `idx`:**
   - `idx` is the index of the largest number in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - If no such number exists, `idx` is -1.

4. **Updating the List `nums`:**
   - If `idx` is valid (not -1), the element `1 << idx` is removed from the list.
   - The elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are added to the list.

5. **Calculating the Length of `nums`:**
   - Initially, `nums` has 22 elements (powers of 2 from 1 to 1048576).
   - If `idx` is valid, one element is removed, so the list has 21 elements.
   - Three new elements are added: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - Therefore, the final length of `nums` is \(21 + 3 = 24\).

6. **If `idx` is -1:**
   - No element is removed.
   - Three new elements are added.
   - Therefore, the final length of `nums` is \(22 + 3 = 25\).

Given the initial state and the operations, the length of `nums` will be either 24 or 25 depending on whether `idx` is valid or not.

However, since the problem does not specify the exact value of `k`, we cannot determine the exact value of `idx`. Therefore, we consider both cases:

- If `idx` is valid, the length of `nums` is 24.
- If `idx` is -1, the length of `nums` is 25.

Since the problem does not provide enough information to determine which case applies, we must consider the most general answer.

Output: **24 or 25 (depending on whether `idx` is valid or not)**
