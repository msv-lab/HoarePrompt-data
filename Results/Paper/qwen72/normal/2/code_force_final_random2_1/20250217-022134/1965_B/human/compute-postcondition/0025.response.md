The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are already positive integers, but the new values from the input will overwrite these initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k - nums[idx], k + 1, k + nums[idx] + 1]` with the element `1 << idx` removed, `idx` is the index of the largest number in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such number exists, `i` is the index of `k + 1` in the updated list `nums`.**
