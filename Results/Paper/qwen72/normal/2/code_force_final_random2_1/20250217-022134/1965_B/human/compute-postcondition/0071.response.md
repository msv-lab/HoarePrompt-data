To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(nums))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the steps involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is the first input positive integer.
   - `k` is the second input positive integer.
   - `nums` is initially a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).

2. **Modifications to `nums`:**
   - The element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed from `nums`.
   - Three additional elements are appended to `nums`: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` (before appending) that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such power of 2 exists.
   - `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` (before appending) that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` (before appending) if no such element exists.

3. **Calculating the Length of `nums`:**
   - Initially, `nums` contains 21 elements (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)).
   - One element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed, reducing the length by 1.
   - Three new elements are added, increasing the length by 3.
   - Therefore, the final length of `nums` is \(21 - 1 + 3 = 23\).

Given this analysis, the `print(len(nums))` statement will print the length of the modified `nums` list, which is 23.

Output: **23**
