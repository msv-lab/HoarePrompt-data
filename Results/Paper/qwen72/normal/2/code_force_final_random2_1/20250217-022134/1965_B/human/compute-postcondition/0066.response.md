Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input positive integer, `k` is the second input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such power of 2 exists, `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such element exists.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `idx` will hold the index of the largest power of 2 in the `nums` list that is less than or equal to `k`. If no such power of 2 exists (i.e., `k` is less than the smallest power of 2 in `nums`), `idx` will remain -1. The variable `i` will hold the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or it will be the length of `nums` if no such element exists. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
