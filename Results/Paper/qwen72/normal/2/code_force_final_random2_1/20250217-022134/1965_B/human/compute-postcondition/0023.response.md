To determine what will be printed by the `print(*nums)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k - nums[idx], k + 1, k + nums[idx] + 1]` with the element `1 << idx` removed.
   - `idx` is the index of the largest number in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such number exists.
   - `i` is the index of `k + 1` in the updated list `nums`.

2. **Understanding the List `nums`:**
   - The list `nums` initially contains powers of 2 from 1 to 1048576.
   - Additional elements are added: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - The element `1 << idx` is removed from the list.

3. **Finding `idx`:**
   - `idx` is the index of the largest number in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - If no such number exists, `idx` is -1.

4. **Updating `nums`:**
   - If `idx` is valid (not -1), the element `1 << idx` is removed from `nums`.
   - The elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are added to `nums`.

5. **Finding `i`:**
   - `i` is the index of `k + 1` in the updated list `nums`.

6. **Final List `nums`:**
   - The final list `nums` will contain the original powers of 2 (with one element removed if `idx` is valid), plus the additional elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

Given the above steps, the `print(*nums)` statement will print the elements of the updated list `nums` separated by spaces.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `k = 100` for illustration:
- The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 100 is 64, so `idx = 6`.
- The element `1 << 6` (which is 64) is removed from the list.
- The list `nums` now contains: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 100 - 64, 100 + 1, 100 + 64 + 1]`.
- Simplifying the additional elements: `100 - 64 = 36`, `100 + 1 = 101`, `100 + 64 + 1 = 165`.
- The final list `nums` is: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 36, 101, 165]`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 2 4 8 16 32 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 36 101 165** (where the list `nums` is the updated list after removing `1 << idx` and adding the additional elements based on the value of `k` and `idx`).
