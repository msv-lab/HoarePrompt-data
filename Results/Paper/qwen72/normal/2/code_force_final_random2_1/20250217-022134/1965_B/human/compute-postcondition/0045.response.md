The code appends the value `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list `nums`. Let's break down the impact:

- `nums` initially contains powers of 2 and an additional element `k - nums[idx]`, followed by `k + 1`.
- `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists.
- `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such element exists.

After appending `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`:
- The length of `nums` increases by 1.
- The new last element of `nums` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `idx`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` appended, followed by `k + 1`, and now also includes `k + nums[idx] + 1`, `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists, `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such element exists.**
