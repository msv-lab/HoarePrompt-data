To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions and the `while` loop statement.

### Given State:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- The length `n` of `s` satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
- `s` is not equal to 'mapie'.
- `ans` is 0.

### Loop Condition:
```python
while s.find('map') != -1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute as long as the substring 'map' is found in `s`.
- The condition `s.find('map') != -1` checks if 'map' is present in `s`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial State of `s`:**
   - `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `s` is not equal to 'mapie'.

2. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute, `s.find('map')` must return a non-negative index, meaning 'map' must be a substring of `s`.

3. **Adjustment Needed:**
   - Since `s` is not equal to 'mapie', we need to ensure that `s` contains the substring 'map' at least once.
   - The length of `s` is between 1 and \(10^6\), which is sufficient to contain 'map'.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, `s` must contain the substring 'map'.
- The current state of `s` being a string of lowercase Latin letters and not equal to 'mapie' does not guarantee that 'map' is a substring of `s`.

### Adjusted State:
- We need to adjust `s` to ensure it contains 'map'. One way to do this is to set `s` to a string that includes 'map' as a substring.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and contains the substring 'map', and its length n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6; `ans` is 0.**
