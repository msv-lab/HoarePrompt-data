The code snippet `s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]` removes the first occurrence of the substring 'pie' from the string `s`, specifically by slicing the string before and after the first occurrence of 'pie' and concatenating these slices.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `s` does not contain the substring 'map'.
- `s` contains at least one occurrence of the substring 'pie'.

After executing the code, the first occurrence of 'pie' in `s` is removed, and the rest of the string remains unchanged. The conditions about `s` not containing 'map' and being composed of lowercase Latin letters remain true.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, no longer contains the substring 'map', and now contains at least one less occurrence of the substring 'pie' (if it contained more than one occurrence initially).**
