Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and no longer contains the substring 'map', and its length n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6; `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'map' is found in `s`.
- Each iteration removes one occurrence of 'map' from `s` and increments `ans` by 1.
- After all iterations, `s` will no longer contain the substring 'map'.
- The value of `ans` will be the total number of times 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s`.
