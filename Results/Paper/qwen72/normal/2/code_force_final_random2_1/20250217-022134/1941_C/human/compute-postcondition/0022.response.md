The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, does not contain the substring 'map', and now contains at least one less occurrence of the substring 'pie' (if it contained more than one occurrence initially). These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, does not contain the substring 'map', and now contains at least one less occurrence of the substring 'pie' (if it contained more than one occurrence initially); `ans` is incremented by 1.**
