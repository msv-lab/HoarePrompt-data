Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check**: The function starts with a special check for the string `'mapie'`. This is an edge case where the string contains both 'map' and 'pie'. However, the function only returns 1, which is incorrect because the string 'mapie' requires at least 2 deletions to become beautiful (either remove 'ma' or 'pie'). This specific check is unnecessary and incorrect.

2. **Removing Substrings**: The function correctly uses a loop to find and remove occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' from the string. Each time a substring is found, it is removed, and the counter `ans` is incremented. This part of the logic is correct.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The function should handle all possible cases where the substrings 'map' and 'pie' appear in the string. The current implementation does this correctly, except for the initial check for 'mapie'.

4. **Efficiency**: The function's approach is efficient enough for the given constraints, as it iterates through the string and removes substrings until none are left. The complexity is O(n * m), where n is the length of the string and m is the length of the substrings being searched for (which is fixed at 3).

5. **Output**: The function correctly returns the total number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Given the above points, the initial check for 'mapie' is incorrect and should be removed. However, the rest of the function is correct.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the issue, the initial check for 'mapie' should be removed:

```python
def func_1(s):
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 3:]  # Corrected to remove 'map' completely
        ans += 1
        
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 3:]  # Corrected to remove 'pie' completely
        ans += 1
        
    return ans
```

This corrected version will ensure that the function works correctly for all cases, including the edge case 'mapie'.
