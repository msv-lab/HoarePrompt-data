Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns the total number of times the substrings 'map' and 'pie' were found and removed from the string. If the string `s` is exactly 'mapie', the function immediately returns 1. Otherwise, it processes the string to remove occurrences of 'map' and 'pie', counting each removal, and returns the total count of these removals. After the function completes, the string `s` will no longer contain the substrings 'map' or 'pie'. **
