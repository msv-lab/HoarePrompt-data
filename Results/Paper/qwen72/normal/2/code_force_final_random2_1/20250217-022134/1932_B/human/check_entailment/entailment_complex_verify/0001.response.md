Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the year when the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The signs must occur sequentially, with the next sign occurring strictly after the previous one.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function is designed to process a string `path` where characters `@` and `*` have specific meanings. It uses dynamic programming to calculate a score based on these characters.
     - The function initializes a DP array `dp` and processes the string `path` to update the DP array.
     - The function returns the maximum value from the DP array that is not negative infinity.
     - **Mismatch**: This function does not align with the problem statement about calculating the year of the nth sign. It is designed for a different problem involving a string with characters `@` and `*`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
     - The input is split into a list `data`, and the function iterates over the test cases, extracting the number of signs `n` and the string `path`.
     - The function appends the result of `func_1(path)` to a list `results` and prints each result.
     - **Mismatch**: The input processing in `func_2` does not match the expected input format for the given problem, which involves reading integers representing the periodicities of the signs. Instead, it treats the periodicities as a single string, which is incorrect.

3. **Annotations and State Analysis**:
   - The annotations confirm that the function `func_1` is designed to handle a string with characters `@` and `*`, and it does not process the periodicities of the signs as required by the problem.
   - The state of the program before and after the function calls confirms that the input is being treated as a single string, which is not the correct approach for the given problem.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The functions are designed for a different problem and do not address the requirements of calculating the year of the nth sign based on periodicities.
   - The input processing in `func_2` is incorrect, treating the periodicities as a single string rather than a list of integers.

Final: **False**
