Output State: **`path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a sign's periodicity as a string, `n` is the length of `path` and must be greater than 0, `dp` is a list with length `n` initialized based on the first and second elements of `path`, and all elements of `dp` from index 2 to `n-1` have been updated according to the rules specified in the loop. Specifically, for each index `i` from 2 to `n-1`, if `path[i]` is '*', then `dp[i]` is set to `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)`. The loop has completed all its iterations, and `i` is now equal to `n`.**
