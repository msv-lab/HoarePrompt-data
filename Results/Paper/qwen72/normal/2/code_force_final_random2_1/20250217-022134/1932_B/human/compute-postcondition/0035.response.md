The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `path`. `path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a sign's periodicity as a string. The length of `path` is at least 1. 

- **Case_1**: If certain conditions within the function lead to all elements in the list `dp` being set to negative infinity, the function returns 0.
- **Case_2**: Otherwise, the function returns the maximum value from the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity. This value is calculated from the elements of `dp` which have been updated based on the following rules:
  - If `path[i]` is '*', then `dp[i]` is set to `-inf`.
  - Otherwise, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process a list `path` and return either 0 or the maximum value from the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity, based on the specific conditions applied to the elements of `path`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `path`, a list of strings. It returns 0 if all elements in the derived list `dp` are set to negative infinity. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value from `dp` that is greater than negative infinity, calculated based on the conditions specified for each element in `path`.**
