You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of signs. path is a string containing n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        path = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        results.append(func_1(path))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last element in `data` that was processed, `path` is the string at the last index in `data` that was processed, `data` remains a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is the final index after processing all elements, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last element in `data` that was processed, `path` is the string at the last index in `data` that was processed, `data` remains a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is the final index after processing all elements, and `results` contains the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `path`. It processes `t` test cases, each with `n` signs having periodicities specified in the `path` string, and returns a result based on these periodicities.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
