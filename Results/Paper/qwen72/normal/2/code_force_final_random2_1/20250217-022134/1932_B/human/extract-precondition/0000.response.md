Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of signs. path is a string containing n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs.**
