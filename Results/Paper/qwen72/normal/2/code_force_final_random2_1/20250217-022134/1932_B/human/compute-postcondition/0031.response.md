The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `path`. 

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of signs.
- `path` is a string containing `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the periodicities of the signs for each test case. However, the specific output for each case is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `path`. It processes `t` test cases, each with `n` signs having periodicities specified in the `path` string, and returns a result based on these periodicities.**
