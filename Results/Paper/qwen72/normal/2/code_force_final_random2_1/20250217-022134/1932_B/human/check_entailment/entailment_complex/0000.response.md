Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the year when the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur sequentially after the previous one. The key is to calculate the next occurrence of each sign strictly after the previous one has occurred.

2. **Function 1 Analysis (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to process a list of strings representing the periodicities of the signs.
   - However, the function is not correctly implemented for the problem. It uses a dynamic programming approach that is not aligned with the problem's requirements. The function is trying to solve a different problem, possibly related to counting occurrences of certain characters, but not the sequential occurrence of signs.
   - The function initializes a `dp` array and updates it based on whether the current element is '@', '*', or a periodicity. This logic does not match the problem's requirement of finding the year when the n-th sign occurs.

3. **Function 2 Analysis (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly splits the input and processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the appropriate periodicity data.
   - However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall program will also be incorrect.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The core logic in `func_1` is not aligned with the problem's requirements. The function should be calculating the year when the n-th sign occurs based on the periodicities and the sequential nature of the signs.
   - Therefore, the program as a whole is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
