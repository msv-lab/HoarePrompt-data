The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases (up to 1000), where each test case involves a set of periodicities (up to 100). For each test case, it calls another function `func_1` with the periodicity data and collects the results. Finally, it prints each result. The function does not return any value but modifies the state by printing the results to the standard output.
