Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the year in which the nth sign will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. However, the functions provided seem to be dealing with a path represented by characters (`@`, `*`), which is not related to the problem at hand.

Here is a correct approach to solving the problem:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(signs):
    current_year = 0
    for period in signs:
        # Find the next year when the current sign occurs
        current_year = ((current_year // period) + 1) * period
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        signs = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(signs))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code correctly calculates the year in which the nth sign will occur based on the given periodicities. It iterates through each sign, updating the current year to the next occurrence of the sign, ensuring that the signs occur sequentially as required.
