Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a sign's periodicity as a string. The length of `path` is at least 1, and `n` is the length of `path`, which is greater than 0. `dp` is a list with length `n`. If the first element of `path` is '@', then the first element of `dp` is `1` and all other elements are `0`. If the first element of `path` is '*', then the first element of `dp` is `-inf` and all other elements are `0`. If the first element of `path` is neither '@' nor '*', then all elements of `dp` remain `0`. If `n` is greater than 1, and the second element of `path` is '*', then the second element of `dp` is `-inf`. If the second element of `path` is not '*', then the second element of `dp` is `2` if `path[1]` is '@' or `1` if `path[1]` is not '@'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(2, n):
    if path[i] == '*':
        dp[i] = -float('inf')
    else:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a sign's periodicity as a string, `n` is the length of `path` and must be greater than 2, `dp` is a list with length `n` initialized based on the first and second elements of `path`, `i` is 2. If `path[i]` is '*', then `dp[2]` is set to `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[2]` is updated to `max(dp[1], dp[0]) + (1 if path[2] == '@' else 0)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a sign's periodicity as a string, `n` is the length of `path` and must be greater than 3, `dp` is a list with length `n` initialized based on the first and second elements of `path`, `i` is 3. If `path[3]` is '*', then `dp[3]` is set to `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[3]` is updated to `max(dp[2], dp[1]) + (1 if path[3] == '@' else 0)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a sign's periodicity as a string, `n` is the length of `path` and must be greater than 4, `dp` is a list with length `n` initialized based on the first and second elements of `path`, `i` is 4. If `path[4]` is '*', then `dp[4]` is set to `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[4]` is updated to `max(dp[3], dp[2]) + (1 if path[4] == '@' else 0)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
