### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the year in which the nth sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the (i+1)-th sign can only occur after the i-th sign has occurred.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function is designed to process a list `path` where each element represents a sign's periodicity. However, the function is incorrectly implemented for the given problem. It uses a dynamic programming approach to count occurrences of '@' and '*' characters, which are not relevant to the problem of finding the year of the nth sign.
     - The function does not correctly handle the periodicity of the signs or the sequential requirement.
   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It collects the results and prints them.
     - The function is correctly structured for reading and processing multiple test cases, but it relies on the incorrect implementation of `func_1`.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to calculate the year in which each sign occurs, ensuring that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one. This can be done by iterating through the periodicities and calculating the next occurrence year for each sign.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
