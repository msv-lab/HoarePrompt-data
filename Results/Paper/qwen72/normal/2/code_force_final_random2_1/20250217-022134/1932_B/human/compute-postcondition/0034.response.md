Output State: **The program returns the maximum value from the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity. This value is calculated from the elements of `dp` which have been updated based on the conditions specified in the loop, where `dp[i]` is set to `-inf` if `path[i]` is '*', otherwise `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)`.**
