Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `path` is a string containing n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `path`, `data`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
