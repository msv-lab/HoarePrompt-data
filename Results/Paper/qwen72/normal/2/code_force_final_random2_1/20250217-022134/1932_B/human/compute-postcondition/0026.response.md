The only object in the loop head is the variable `result` from the list `results`. The loop's ability to execute again depends on whether there are more elements in `results` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `results` must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least two elements, and `result` will be the second element in the list.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last element in `data` that was processed, `path` is the string at the last index in `data` that was processed, `data` remains a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is the final index after processing all elements, `results` must contain at least two elements, `result` is the second element in `results`**
