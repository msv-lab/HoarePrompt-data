Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

    #State: `path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a sign's periodicity as a string, `n` is the length of `path` and must be greater than 0, `dp` is a list with length `n` initialized based on the first and second elements of `path`, and all elements of `dp` from index 2 to `n-1` have been updated according to the rules specified in the loop. Specifically, for each index `i` from 2 to `n-1`, if `path[i]` is '*', then `dp[i]` is set to `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)`. The loop has completed all its iterations, and `i` is now equal to `n`.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity. This value is calculated from the elements of `dp` which have been updated based on the conditions specified in the loop, where `dp[i]` is set to `-inf` if `path[i]` is '*', otherwise `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `path` as input, where each element in the list is a string representing either '@', '*', or a sign's periodicity. The function processes this list to compute a dynamic programming array `dp` based on specific rules. If the list `path` is empty, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it initializes `dp` and updates its values based on the characters in `path`. For each element in `path`, if the element is '*', the corresponding `dp` value is set to negative infinity. If the element is '@', the `dp` value is incremented by 1. The final value returned is the maximum value in `dp` that is greater than negative infinity. If all values in `dp` are negative infinity, the function returns 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of signs. path is a string containing n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs.

    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []

        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        path = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        results.append(func_1(path))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last element in `data` that was processed, `path` is the string at the last index in `data` that was processed, `data` remains a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is the final index after processing all elements, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last element in `data` that was processed, `path` is the string at the last index in `data` that was processed, `data` remains a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is the final index after processing all elements, and `results` contains the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases (up to 1000), where each test case involves a set of periodicities (up to 100). For each test case, it calls another function `func_1` with the periodicity data and collects the results. Finally, it prints each result. The function does not return any value but modifies the state by printing the results to the standard output.
