Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the year when the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The signs must occur sequentially, with the next sign occurring strictly after the previous one.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function appears to be designed for a different problem. It uses dynamic programming to process a string `path` where characters `@` and `*` have specific meanings. This function does not align with the problem statement about calculating the year of the nth sign.
     - The function initializes a DP array `dp` and processes the string `path` to calculate some score based on the presence of `@` and `*`.
     - The function returns the maximum value from the DP array that is not negative infinity.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
     - The input is split into a list `data`, and the function iterates over the test cases, extracting the number of signs `n` and the string `path`.
     - The function appends the result of `func_1(path)` to a list `results` and prints each result.

3. **Mismatch**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to solve a problem involving a string with characters `@` and `*`, which is not related to the problem of calculating the year of the nth sign based on periodicities.
   - The input processing in `func_2` also does not match the expected input format for the given problem, which involves reading integers representing the periodicities of the signs.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The functions are designed for a different problem and do not address the requirements of calculating the year of the nth sign based on periodicities.

Correctness: **False**
