The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the standard input and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces. This means that `data` will now contain a list of strings, each representing one of the space-separated integers from the input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of signs.
- `path` is a string containing n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs.
- `input` is now a function that reads from standard input.

After executing the code snippet:
- `data` is a list of strings, where each string is one of the space-separated integers from the input.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `path` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `path` is a string containing n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces.**
