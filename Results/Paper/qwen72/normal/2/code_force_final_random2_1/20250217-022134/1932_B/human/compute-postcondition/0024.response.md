To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object in the loop head, which is `results`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is 0
- `n` is the integer value of the last element in `data` that was processed
- `path` is the string at the last index in `data` that was processed
- `data` remains a list of strings representing the input split by spaces
- `index` is the final index after processing all elements
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop

For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `path`, `data`, `index`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `results` is non-empty.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last element in `data` that was processed, `path` is the string at the last index in `data` that was processed, `data` remains a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is the final index after processing all elements, `results` must contain at least one element**
