Postcondition: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `k` is `n`, `h` is `n-1`, and `li` has `n^2` elements, where each element is `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. The list `li` is now sorted in ascending order. Additionally, `l` is equal to `li`.**
