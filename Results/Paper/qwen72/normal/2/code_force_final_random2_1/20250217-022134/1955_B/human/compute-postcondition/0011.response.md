To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `h` and `n`.

Given:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500
- `h` is `n-1` (initially)
- `li` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`
- `k` is `k + 1` and `k` must be less than `n`

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `h` should start from 0. The initial state of `h` being `n-1` is not relevant to the loop's execution since the loop will set `h` starting from 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (which is already satisfied by the given condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 500)
- `h` should start from 0

Since `n` is already within the required range, no adjustment is needed for `n`. The variable `h` needs to be set to 0 for the loop to start correctly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is 0**
