Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. Each test case reads `n`, `c`, and `d` followed by a list of `n^2` integers `l`.

2. **Initialization and Calculation**:
   - The minimum value `a` is correctly identified from the list `l`.
   - A new list `li` is generated by iterating over all possible indices `(k, h)` in the `n x n` grid and calculating the value `a + k * c + d * h` for each cell. This correctly simulates the construction of the progressive square.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Both lists `li` and `l` are sorted before comparison. Sorting ensures that the order of elements does not affect the comparison.
   - The program checks if the sorted list `li` (which represents the expected progressive square) matches the sorted list `l` (which represents the elements found by Maxim).

4. **Output**:
   - If the lists match, the program returns 'yes', indicating that the elements can form the progressive square.
   - If the lists do not match, the program returns 'no', indicating that the elements cannot form the progressive square.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints well, ensuring that `n`, `c`, and `d` are within the specified ranges.
   - The program also handles the case where the input list `l` might contain duplicate values or values that do not fit the progressive square pattern.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
