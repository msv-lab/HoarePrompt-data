Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is `n-1`, and `li` has `2 * n` elements, where the first `n` elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and the next `n` elements are also `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was initially set.
- The variable `h` ends up being `n-1` after the loop completes, as it iterates from 0 to `n-1`.
- The list `li` initially had `n` elements. After the loop runs, `n` more elements are appended to `li`, making the total length of `li` equal to `2 * n`.
- Each of the new elements appended to `li` is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, which is the same formula used to generate the initial elements of `li`.
