Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is `n-1`, `li` has `3 * n` elements, where the first `2 * n` elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1` (repeated twice), and the last `n` elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, `k` is `n`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The value of `n` remains the same as it was initially, within the range 2 to 500.
- The variable `h` will be equal to `n-1` because the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`.
- The list `li` will now contain `3 * n` elements. The first `2 * n` elements are the same as they were before the loop started, with each element being calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1` (this sequence is repeated twice). The last `n` elements are the new elements added by the loop, each calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
- The value of `k` remains `n` as it was not modified within the loop.
