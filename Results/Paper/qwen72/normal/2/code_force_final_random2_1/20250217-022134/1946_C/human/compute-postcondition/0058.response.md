Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as one of its elements (and `b` is appended again), `adj[b]` now contains `a` as one of its elements (and `a` is appended again)**

Explanation:
- The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The variables `a` and `b` are updated to the integers read from the input.
- The lists `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` are still updated to contain each other as elements, with `b` appended to `adj[a]` and `a` appended to `adj[b]`.
