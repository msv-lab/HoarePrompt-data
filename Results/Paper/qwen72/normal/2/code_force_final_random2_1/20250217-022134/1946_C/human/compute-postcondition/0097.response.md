The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 (specifically, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue).

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements, `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements.**
