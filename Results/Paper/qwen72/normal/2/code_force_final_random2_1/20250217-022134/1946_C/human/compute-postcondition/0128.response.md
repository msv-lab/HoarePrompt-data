Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` `n-1` times, `adj[b]` now includes `a` `n-1` times, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 25001), then `L` is 25001 and `R` is 50001, otherwise `L` is 1 and `R` is 25001.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `numCuts` to 0, which was previously 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the same conditions and values as the initial state, with the explicit confirmation that `numCuts` is 0.
