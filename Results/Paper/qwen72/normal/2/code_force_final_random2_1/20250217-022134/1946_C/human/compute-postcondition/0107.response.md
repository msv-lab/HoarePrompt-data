Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` `n-1` times, `adj[b]` now includes `a` `n-1` times, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001.** 

Explanation: The code assigns the value `100001` to the variable `R`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
