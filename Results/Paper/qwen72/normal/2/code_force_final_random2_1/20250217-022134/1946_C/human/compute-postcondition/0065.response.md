To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `R - L > 1`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `L` is 1
- `R` is 100001

We need to check if `R - L > 1` holds true with these values.

Calculating `R - L`:
- `R - L = 100001 - 1 = 100000`

Since `100000 > 1`, the condition `R - L > 1` is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `L` or `R` for the loop to execute the first time.

Thus, the state remains unchanged:
State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all the integers `y` such that `(x, y)` or `(y, x)` were read as pairs during the loop's execution. The other variables (`t`, `z`, `k`) remain unchanged, `L` is now 1, `R` is 100001, and `numCuts` is 0.**
