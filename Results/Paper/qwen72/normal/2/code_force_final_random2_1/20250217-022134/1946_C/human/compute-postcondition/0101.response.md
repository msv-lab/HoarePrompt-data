The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n-1`. If `i` is less than `n-1`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Since `n` is greater than 2, `n-1` is greater than 1, and thus the condition `i < n-1` will still hold true if `i` is 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` twice, `adj[b]` now includes `a` twice.**
