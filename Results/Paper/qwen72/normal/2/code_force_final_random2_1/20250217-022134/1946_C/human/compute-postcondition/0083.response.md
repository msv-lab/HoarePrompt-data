Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all the integers `y` such that `(x, y)` or `(y, x)` were read as pairs during the loop's execution, `t`, `z`, `k` remain unchanged, `x` is now `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `numCuts` to 0.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `adj`, `t`, `z`, `k`, `x`, `leftover`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition for updating `L` or `R` is not evaluated because the code snippet only sets `numCuts` to 0 and does not execute the conditional logic.
