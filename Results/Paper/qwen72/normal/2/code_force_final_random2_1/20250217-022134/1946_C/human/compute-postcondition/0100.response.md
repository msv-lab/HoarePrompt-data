Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` twice, `adj[b]` now includes `a` twice.**

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` adds `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` included `a` once, so after the execution, `adj[b]` now includes `a` twice. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
