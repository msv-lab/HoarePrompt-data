Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all the integers `y` such that `(x, y)` or `(y, x)` were read as pairs during the loop's execution, `t`, `z`, `k` remain unchanged, `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation:
- The variable `L` is updated to the value of `x`, which is 50001.
- All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
