Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` is `n-2`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all the integers `y` such that `(x, y)` or `(y, x)` were read as pairs during the loop's execution. The other variables (`t`, `z`, `k`) remain unchanged, `L` is now 1, `R` is 100001, and `numCuts` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n-2`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all the integers `y` such that `(x, y)` or `(y, x)` were read as pairs during the loop's execution, `t`, `z`, `k` remain unchanged, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`i` is `n-2`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all the integers `y` such that `(x, y)` or `(y, x)` were read as pairs during the loop's execution, `t`, `z`, `k` remain unchanged, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), `L` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. Otherwise, `R` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`i` is `n-2`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all the integers `y` such that `(x, y)` or `(y, x)` were read as pairs during the loop's execution, `t`, `z`, `k` remain unchanged, `x` is now `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), `L` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. Otherwise, `R` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
