The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. These parameters are constrained as follows: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.

Since the output is not specified in the provided information, I cannot determine the exact return value of the function. However, based on typical programming practices, the function might perform some computation or operation using these parameters and return a result based on that computation.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `k` are positive integers (1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5), and `a` and `b` are positive integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n). The function performs an operation using these parameters and returns a result based on that operation.**
