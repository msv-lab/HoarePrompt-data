To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `n - 1`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `range(n - 1)` generates a sequence of numbers. This means `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1 (i.e., `n - 1 >= 1`).
   - Simplifying this condition, we get `n >= 2`.

3. **Adjust States:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` will start at 0 when the loop begins.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (unchanged).
- `z` is 0 (unchanged).
- `n` and `k` are updated to the first and second integers read from the input respectively, but `n` must be at least 2.
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n (unchanged).
- `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` (unchanged).
- `i` is 0 (initial value for the loop).

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`, `i` is 0**
