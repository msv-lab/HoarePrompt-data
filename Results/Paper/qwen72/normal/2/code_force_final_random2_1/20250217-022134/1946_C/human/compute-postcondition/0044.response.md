Output State: **The loop continues to narrow down the range between `L` and `R` until `R - L <= 1`. At this point, `L` will be the largest integer such that the conditions `numCuts <= k` and (`numCuts < k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover < x`)) are satisfied. The final values of `L` and `R` will be such that `R = L + 1`. The values of `t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `adj`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.**
