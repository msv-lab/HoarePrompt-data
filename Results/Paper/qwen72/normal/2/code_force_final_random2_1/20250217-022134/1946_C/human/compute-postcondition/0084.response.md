Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all the integers `y` such that `(x, y)` or `(y, x)` were read as pairs during the loop's execution, `t`, `z`, `k` remain unchanged, `x` is now `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The line `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` assigns the result of the function call `dfs(1, 1)` to the variable `leftover`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `adj`, `t`, `z`, `k`, `x`, `numCuts`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `leftover` is now the result of the `dfs` function, which is not specified in the initial state but is updated in the output state.
