Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` `n-1` times, `adj[b]` now includes `a` `n-1` times, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001.** 

Explanation: The value of `x` is calculated as `(L + R) // 2`. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, the calculation is `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which results in 50001. All other variables remain unchanged.
