Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `adj[a]` now contains `b` twice as its elements, `adj[b]` now contains `a` as one of its elements (and `a` is appended again).** 

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `adj[a]` already contained `b` as one of its elements, it now contains `b` twice. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
