To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while R - L > 1:
```

The loop will execute if the difference between `R` and `L` is greater than 1. Given the initial state:

- `L` is 1
- `R` is 100001

We need to check if `R - L > 1` holds true with these values.

Calculating the difference:
- `R - L = 100001 - 1 = 100000`

Since 100000 is indeed greater than 1, the condition `R - L > 1` is satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, and each list in `adj` contains the indices of nodes connected to the corresponding node. The loop has executed `n - 1` times, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0**
