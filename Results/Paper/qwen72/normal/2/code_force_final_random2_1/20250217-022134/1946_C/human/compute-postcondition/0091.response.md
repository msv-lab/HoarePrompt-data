Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is updated to the first integer read from the input, `k` is updated to the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all the integers `y` such that `(x, y)` or `(y, x)` were read as pairs during the loop's execution, `t` remains unchanged, `z` is `z + 1`, `L` is the largest value such that the condition `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`) is false, `R` is the smallest value such that the condition `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`) is true, and `numCuts` is 0.**
