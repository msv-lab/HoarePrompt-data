To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `R - L > 1`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `L` is 1
- `R` is 100001

We need to check if `R - L > 1` holds true with these values.

Calculating `R - L`:
- `R - L = 100001 - 1 = 100000`

Since 100000 is greater than 1, the condition `R - L > 1` is satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` `n-1` times, `adj[b]` now includes `a` `n-1` times, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0**
