Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are the first and second integers read from the input, respectively, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, `i` is 1, `adj[a]` now contains the value `b` appended to its existing list, `adj[b]` now contains the value `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value `b` to the list `adj[a]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- The structure of `adj` remains a list of lists with length `n + 1`.
- The value `b` is added to the list at index `a` in `adj`, making `adj[a]` contain both the original value `b` and the newly appended `b`.
- The value `a` is already present in `adj[b]` as per the initial state, and this remains unchanged.
