Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` `n-1` times, `adj[b]` now includes `a` `n-1` times, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, and either `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`).**

Explanation: The value of `R` is updated to 50001, which is the same as the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
