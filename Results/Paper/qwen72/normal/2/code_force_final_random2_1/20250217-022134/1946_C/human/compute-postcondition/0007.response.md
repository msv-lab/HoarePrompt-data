Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are the first and second integers read from the input, respectively, and `adj[a]` now contains the value `b`, `adj[b]` now contains the value `a`.** 

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` adds the value `a` to the list `adj[b]`. This means that `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
