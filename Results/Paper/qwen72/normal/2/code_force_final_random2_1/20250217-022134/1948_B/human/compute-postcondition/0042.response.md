Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[0]` followed by the integer `arr[1]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True and `arr[0]` is updated to `nums[0]`.***
