Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `m - 3`, and `ans` is True. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` as integers followed by the integer `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True and `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`.***
