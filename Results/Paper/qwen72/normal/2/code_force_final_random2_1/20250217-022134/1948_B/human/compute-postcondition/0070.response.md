The value of `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `i` is `m - 1`, `arr[i - 1]` is the element just before the last element in the sublist defined by `m`. The value of `nums[0]` is the first digit of the number formed by `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `m - 1`, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**
