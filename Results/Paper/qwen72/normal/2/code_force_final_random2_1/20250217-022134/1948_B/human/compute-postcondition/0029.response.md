To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `m` is the input integer.
   - `arr` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether the condition inside the loop was met and caused `ans` to be set to `False`.

2. **Condition Inside the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates through the list `arr` starting from index 1.
   - For each iteration, it checks if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`.
   - If this condition is true, `ans` is set to `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any such instances, `ans` remains `True`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement uses a list to select between 'NO' and 'YES' based on the value of `ans`.
   - If `ans` is `True`, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `ans` is `False`, it prints 'NO'.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the value of `ans` will be:
- `True` if the list `arr` is non-decreasing (i.e., no element is less than the previous element).
- `False` if there is at least one element in `arr` that is less than the previous element.

Therefore, the output will be:
- 'YES' if `ans` is `True`.
- 'NO' if `ans` is `False`.

Output: **['NO', 'YES'][ans] (where 'NO' is printed if ans is False, and 'YES' is printed if ans is True)**
