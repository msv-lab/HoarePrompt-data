Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `m - 2`, `i` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The code creates a new list `nums`.
- It first converts the integer `arr[i - 1]` to a string, then iterates over each character in the string, converting each character back to an integer, and collects these integers into a list.
- This list of digits is then concatenated with a list containing the single element `arr[i]`.
- The resulting list is assigned to `nums`.
- All other variables (`n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, `i`) remain unchanged.
