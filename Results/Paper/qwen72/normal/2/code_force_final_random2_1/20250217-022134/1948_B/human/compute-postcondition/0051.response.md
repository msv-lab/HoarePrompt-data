The code snippet provided converts the integer at index `i-1` in the list `arr` into a list of its digits and concatenates this list with the integer at index `i` in `arr`. Let's break down the impact:

- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `arr[i - 1]` is the integer at index `i-1` in the list `arr`.
- `str(arr[i - 1])` converts this integer to a string.
- `[int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])]` converts each character in the string back to an integer, creating a list of digits.
- `arr[i]` is the integer at index `i` in the list `arr`.
- The final list `nums` is the concatenation of the list of digits and the integer at index `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 1.
- `m` is greater than 1.
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `ans` is True.

After executing the code:
- `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[m - 2]` followed by the integer `arr[m - 1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `m - 1`, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[m - 2]` followed by the integer `arr[m - 1]`.**
