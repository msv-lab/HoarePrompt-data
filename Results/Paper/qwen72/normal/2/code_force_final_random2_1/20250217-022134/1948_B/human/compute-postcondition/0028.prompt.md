Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `ans` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `m - 1`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, the current value of `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[m - 2]` followed by `arr[m - 1]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `m - 2`, and `i` must be greater than 0. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `m - 3`, and `i` must be greater than 0. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`, and if `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
