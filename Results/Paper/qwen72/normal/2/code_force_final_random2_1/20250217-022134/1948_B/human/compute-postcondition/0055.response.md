Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[m - 2]` followed by the integer `arr[m - 1]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**
