To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the loop head).
- `m` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers from the new input.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `ans` is initially True.
- The loop condition is `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`.

### Loop Head Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` starting from `m - 1` down to 1 (inclusive).
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than 0.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `ans` is True (assuming no changes were made to it in the loop body).

### Adjustments Needed for the Next Iteration:
- The loop will decrement `i` by 1 for the next iteration.
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `m - 2`.

### Final State:
- `i` is `m - 2`.
- `m` is still greater than or equal to 2.
- `ans` remains True unless changed in the loop body.

### State:
**`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is True.**
