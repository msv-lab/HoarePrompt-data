Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `m` is the new input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `ans` to `True`. This overrides the previous value of `ans`, which could have been either `True` or `False` depending on the condition inside the loop. All other variables (`n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `ans` while keeping the rest of the variables in their initial state.
