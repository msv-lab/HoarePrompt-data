Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is 0, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the subsequent check `nums != sorted(nums)` were met during any iteration. If `ans` is False, the loop broke early due to the unsorted `nums` condition; otherwise, the loop completed all iterations with `ans` remaining True.**
