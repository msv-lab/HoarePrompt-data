Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 0, and `ans` is True. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, the last element of `arr` is now equal to `arr[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the last element of `arr` followed by the first element of `arr`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.***
