Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is 0, and `ans` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is initially True. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, no changes are made to `arr` or `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is True. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True and `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `m - 3`, and `ans` is True. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` as integers followed by the integer `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True and `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
