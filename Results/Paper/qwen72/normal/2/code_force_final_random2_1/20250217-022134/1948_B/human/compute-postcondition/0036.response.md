Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[0]` followed by the integer `arr[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]` creates a new list `nums`.
- `arr[i - 1]` is `arr[0]` because `i` is 1.
- `str(arr[0])` converts the integer `arr[0]` to a string.
- `[int(i) for i in str(arr[0])]` converts each character in the string representation of `arr[0]` back to an integer, creating a list of its digits.
- `[arr[i]]` is `[arr[1]]` because `i` is 1.
- The `+` operator concatenates the list of digits of `arr[0]` with the list containing `arr[1]`.
- Therefore, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by the integer `arr[1]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
