Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `m - 1`, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the value of `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[m - 2]` followed by `arr[m - 1]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.***
