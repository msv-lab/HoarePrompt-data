Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `m` representing the length of an array, followed by `m` integers forming the array. The function determines if it is possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly performing an operation that splits an element into its digits and rearranges them. The function prints "YES" if the array can be sorted this way, and "NO" otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. **
