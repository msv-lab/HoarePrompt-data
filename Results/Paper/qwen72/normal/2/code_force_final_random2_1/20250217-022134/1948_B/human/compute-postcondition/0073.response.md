Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `m - 2`, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation:
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `_` remains 2.
- `m` remains greater than or equal to 2.
- `arr` remains a list of integers from the new input.
- `i` remains `m - 2`.
- `ans` remains True.
- `nums` is updated to a list containing the digits of the integer at index `i - 1` in `arr`, followed by the integer at index `i` in `arr`.
