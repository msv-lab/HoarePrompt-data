The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, and converts each part into an integer, storing these integers in a list called `arr`.

- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `_` remains 0.
- `m` remains an input integer.
- A new list `arr` is created containing the integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input.**
