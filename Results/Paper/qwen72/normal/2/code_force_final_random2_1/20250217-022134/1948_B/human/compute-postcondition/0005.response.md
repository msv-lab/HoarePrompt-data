To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - `i`: This is the loop variable that will take values from `m - 1` down to 1.
   - `m`: This is the upper bound for the loop, and it must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `m - 1` is greater than or equal to 1. This means `m` must be at least 2.
   - The loop will decrement `i` from `m - 1` to 1 (inclusive).

3. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `ans` is True.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 2.
   - The initial value of `i` should be `m - 1`.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `m` must be at least 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input.
- `ans` is True.
- `i` is `m - 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `ans` is True, `i` is `m - 1`**
