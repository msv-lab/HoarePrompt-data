Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is initially True. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, no changes are made to `arr` or `ans`.***
