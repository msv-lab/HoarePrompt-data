The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Let's break down the impact:

- `ans` was initially `n + 2 * ((n + b) // (b * b))`.
- The new value of `ans` is `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`, which simplifies to `n + 2 * ((n + b) // (b * b)) + (n + b) // (b * b)`.
- This further simplifies to `n + 3 * ((n + b) // (b * b))`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `b`, `t`, and `T` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers converted from their original string values, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `T` is 1, `ans` is `n + 3 * ((n + b) // (b * b))`.**
