Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that at least one of them is greater than or equal to `min(n, m)`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `T` is 0, `ans` is `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These are the original input integers, and at least one of them must be greater than or equal to `min(n, m)` for the loop to execute.
- **`b`**: After the loop finishes, `b` will be `min(n, m) + 1` because the loop iterates from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1` (exclusive).
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop.
- **`T`**: This variable remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop.
- **`ans`**: The final value of `ans` is the initial value `n` plus the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. This sum is computed for each iteration of the loop.
