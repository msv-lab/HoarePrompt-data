Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `m` are integers such that they are the last values read from input, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` is the total number of iterations specified initially, `T` is `t - 1`, and `ans` is the final value calculated as `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))` for each iteration.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These are the last values of `n` and `m` read from the input during the final iteration of the loop.
- **`b`**: After the inner loop completes, `b` will be `min(n, m) + 1` because the loop runs from 2 to `min(n, m)`.
- **`t`**: This remains the total number of iterations specified initially.
- **`T`**: This is the loop counter, which will be `t - 1` after the final iteration.
- **`ans`**: For each iteration, `ans` is updated to `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`. The final value of `ans` is the result of the last iteration.
