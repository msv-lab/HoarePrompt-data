Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers converted from their original string values, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `T` is 1, `ans` is `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`**

Explanation:
- `n` and `m` are converted from strings to integers.
- The values of `b`, `t`, `T`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The initial state information about `b`, `t`, `T`, and `ans` is still valid.
