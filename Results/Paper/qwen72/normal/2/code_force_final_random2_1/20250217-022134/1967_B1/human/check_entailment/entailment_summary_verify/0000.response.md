### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Formula**:
   - The program uses the formula `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` to calculate the number of valid pairs. This formula does not reflect the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The correct approach should involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

2. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\). The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
   - The program's logic will not correctly count these pairs because it uses an incorrect formula.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary correctly describes the program's behavior but does not highlight the logical error in the formula used to calculate `ans`.

### Correct Implementation Example:
A correct implementation would involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This implementation correctly checks the condition for each pair \((a, b)\) and counts the valid pairs.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect due to the use of an incorrect formula to calculate the number of valid pairs.

Final: **False**
