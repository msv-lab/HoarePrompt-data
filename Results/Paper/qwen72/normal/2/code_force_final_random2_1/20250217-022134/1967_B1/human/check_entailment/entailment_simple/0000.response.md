Reasoning:  
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not being checked properly. Instead, the program calculates `ans` using the formula `(n + b) // (b * b)`, which does not reflect the required condition.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, this direct approach would be too slow given the constraints. A more efficient approach involves understanding the mathematical properties of the problem and optimizing the calculation accordingly.

The current implementation incorrectly adds `(n + b) // (b * b)` to `ans` for each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. This formula does not correspond to the problem's requirements and will produce incorrect results.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
