Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value. If `lex` < 28, `arr` is [1, 1] and `lex` is the input integer minus 2. If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is now `lex - 52` (which is between -24 and 26). If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is `lex - 52` (which is between 0 and 26). If `lex` > 78, `arr` remains an empty list and `lex` is the input integer.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs exactly 2 times because `j` ranges from 0 to 1 (inclusive).
- For each iteration, the conditions on `lex` determine what gets appended to `arr` and how `lex` is updated.
- After the first iteration, `arr` will be `[1]` if `lex` was less than 28, `[26]` if `lex` was between 28 and 51, or `[26]` if `lex` was between 52 and 78.
- After the second iteration, `arr` will be `[1, 1]` if `lex` was less than 28, `[26, 26]` if `lex` was between 28 and 51, or `[26, 26]` if `lex` was between 52 and 78.
- If `lex` was greater than 78, `arr` remains an empty list and `lex` is unchanged.
- The variable `j` is incremented to 2 after the loop completes, and `info` is updated to include the final `arr`.
