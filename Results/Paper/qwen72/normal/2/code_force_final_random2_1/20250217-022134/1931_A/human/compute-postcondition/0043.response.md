The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. We need to consider the two possible cases for `arr` based on the value of `lex`.

### Case 1: `lex` < 28
- Initial `arr`: `[1, 1, lex]`
- After sorting: Since `lex` is less than 28, and both elements 1 are already the smallest, the sorted list will be `[1, 1, lex]`.

### Case 2: 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78
- Initial `arr`: `[26, 26, lex]`
- After sorting: Since `lex` is between 28 and 78, and both elements 26 are already the smallest, the sorted list will be `[26, 26, lex]`.

The values of `n`, `cases`, `info`, `i`, `j`, and `lex` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `arr` is [1, 1, `lex`] if `lex` < 28, `arr` is [26, 26, `lex`] if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, and `lex` is reduced by 52 if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78.**
