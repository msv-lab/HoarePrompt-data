Reasoning:  
The program aims to decode an integer back into a three-letter word, ensuring that the word is the lexicographically smallest possible. The approach taken by the program involves breaking down the integer into three parts, which represent the positions of the letters in the alphabet. However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Lexicographical Order**: The program sorts the array `arr` after determining the three parts, which is incorrect. Sorting the array changes the order of the letters, which may not result in the lexicographically smallest word. For example, for the input `24`, the program should output `aav`, but sorting the array might change the order to `aav` incorrectly.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Parts**: The logic used to determine the parts of the word is flawed. Specifically, the conditions `if lex < 28`, `elif lex < 52`, and `elif lex <= 78` do not correctly handle all possible values of `lex`. For example, if `lex` is 78, the program will always append 26 twice and then the remaining value, which is not always correct.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if `lex` is 3, the program should output `aaa`, but the current logic might not handle this correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
