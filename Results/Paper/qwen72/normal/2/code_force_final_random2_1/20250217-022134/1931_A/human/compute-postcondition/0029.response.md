Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `lex` < 28, `arr` is [1] and `lex` is reduced by 1, making `lex` less than 27. If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is [26] and `lex` is reduced by 26, making `lex` between 2 and 26. If `lex` ≥ 52, `arr` is [26] if 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, and `arr` is an empty list if `lex` > 78, with `lex` remaining unchanged in both cases.***
