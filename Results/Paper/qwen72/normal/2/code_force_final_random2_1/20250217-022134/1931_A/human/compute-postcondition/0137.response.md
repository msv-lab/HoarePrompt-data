The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the constant `3`, so we can only adjust `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `3`. If `j` is less than `3`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` must be less than `3`.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 0, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers, `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration, `i` is 0, `temp` is now a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[0][0] + 96` and `info[0][1] + 96`, `j` is 2**
