The code `info.append(arr)` adds the list `arr` to the list `info`. Let's analyze the impact of this code:

- `info` was initially an empty list, so after appending `arr`, `info` will contain one element, which is the list `arr`.
- The value of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`:
  - If `lex` < 28, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`.
  - If 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex]` and `lex` is reduced by 52.

Since `lex` is reduced by 52 only if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, the value of `lex` after this reduction (if applicable) should be considered in the final state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is [[1, 1, lex]] if `lex` < 28, `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]] if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `arr` is [1, 1, lex] if `lex` < 28, `arr` is [26, 26, lex - 52] if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, and `lex` is reduced by 52 if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78.**
