Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 1, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers, `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration, `i` is 2, `temp` is an empty string, `j` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `temp = ''` resets the value of `temp` to an empty string.
- All other variables (`n`, `cases`, `info`, `lex`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
