The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the range limit `2`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it runs twice. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2, but since the loop condition is `j in range(2)`, the loop will not execute again because `j` would then be out of the specified range.

However, since the task is to describe the state at the start of the next iteration, and the loop does not actually run another iteration because `j` is already at the upper limit of the range, the correct state should reflect that `j` is incremented to 2, but the loop will not proceed further.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `arr` is either [1, 1], [26, 1], [1, 26], or [26, 26]. If `lex` < 28, `arr` is [1, 1] or [26, 1], `lex` is the input integer minus 1, and `info` is [[1, 1, lex]] if the original `lex` was less than 28, or `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]] if the original `lex` was ≥ 28. If `lex` ≥ 28, `arr` is [1, 26] or [26, 26], and `info` is updated to [[1, 1, lex - 26]] if 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, or [[26, 26, lex - 52]] if 52 ≤ `lex` < 78, or [[26, 26, lex - 78]] if `lex` ≥ 78. If `lex` > 78, `info` and `arr` remain unchanged.**
