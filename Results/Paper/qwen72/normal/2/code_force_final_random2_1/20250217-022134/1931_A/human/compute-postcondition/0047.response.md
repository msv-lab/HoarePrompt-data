Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `info` is [[1, 1, lex]] if `lex` < 28, `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]] if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is an empty list, and `lex` is the input integer.** 

The value of `lex` is updated to the integer input provided by the user. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
