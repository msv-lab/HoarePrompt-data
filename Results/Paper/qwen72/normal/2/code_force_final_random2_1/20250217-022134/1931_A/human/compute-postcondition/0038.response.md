Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `lex` < 52, `lex` is updated to `lex - 26` and `arr` is now [26]. If `lex` ≤ 78, `lex` is updated to `lex - 26` and `arr` now contains [26]. Otherwise, `lex` and `arr` remain unchanged.***
