Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `arr` is either [1, 1], [26, 1], [1, 26], or [26, 26]. If `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` is updated to [1, 1, 26], [26, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26]. `lex` is the input integer minus 27, and `info` is updated as follows: if the original `lex` was less than 28, `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 1]]; if 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 27]]; if 52 ≤ `lex` < 78, `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 27]]; if `lex` ≥ 78, `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 53]]. If `lex` > 78, `info` and `arr` remain unchanged.***
