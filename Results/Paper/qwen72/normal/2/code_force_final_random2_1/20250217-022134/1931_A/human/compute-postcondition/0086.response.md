The code snippet `info.append(arr)` adds the list `arr` to the end of the list `info`. Let's go through the impact of this code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
   - `cases` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `arr` is one of the following: [1, 1, lex], [1, 26, lex], [26, 26, lex].
   - `lex` is the input integer minus 2, 52, or 52 (as per the conditions).
   - `info` is one of the following: [[1, 1, lex - 2]], [[1, 1, lex - 52]], [[26, 26, lex - 52]], or [[26, 26, lex - 52]].

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The list `arr` is appended to the list `info`.

3. **Updated State**:
   - `info` now contains the original list plus the new list `arr`.

Let's consider each possible value of `arr` and `info`:

- If `arr` is [1, 1, lex] and `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 2]]:
  - `info` becomes [[1, 1, lex - 2], [1, 1, lex]].

- If `arr` is [1, 1, lex] and `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 52]]:
  - `info` becomes [[1, 1, lex - 52], [1, 1, lex]].

- If `arr` is [1, 26, lex] and `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 2]]:
  - `info` becomes [[1, 1, lex - 2], [1, 26, lex]].

- If `arr` is [1, 26, lex] and `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 52]]:
  - `info` becomes [[1, 1, lex - 52], [1, 26, lex]].

- If `arr` is [26, 26, lex] and `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]]:
  - `info` becomes [[26, 26, lex - 52], [26, 26, lex]].

- If `arr` is [26, 26, lex] and `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]]:
  - `info` becomes [[26, 26, lex - 52], [26, 26, lex]].

All other variables (`n`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `arr`, `lex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is one of [1, 1, lex], [1, 26, lex], [26, 26, lex], `lex` is the input integer minus 2, 52, or 52, `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value.**
