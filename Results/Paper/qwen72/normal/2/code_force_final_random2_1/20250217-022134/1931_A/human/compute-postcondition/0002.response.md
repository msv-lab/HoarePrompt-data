The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The other variables (`n` and `info`) do not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
