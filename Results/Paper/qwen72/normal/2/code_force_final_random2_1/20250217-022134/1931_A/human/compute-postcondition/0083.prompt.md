Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `info` is [[1, 1, lex]] if `lex` < 28, `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]] if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is an empty list, and `lex` is the input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `arr` is either [1] or [26]. If `lex` < 28, `info` is [[1, 1, lex]], and `lex` is the input integer with the current value of `lex` being less than 28. If `lex` ≥ 28, `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]]. If `lex` < 52, `lex` is an integer where 28 ≤ lex ≤ 51. If `lex` ≥ 52, `info` is updated to [[26, 26, lex - 78]], and `lex` is an integer where 28 ≤ lex ≤ 78.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `arr` is either [1, 1], [26, 1], [1, 26], or [26, 26]. If `lex` < 28, `arr` is [1, 1] or [26, 1], `lex` is the input integer minus 1, and `info` is [[1, 1, lex]] if the original `lex` was less than 28, or `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]] if the original `lex` was ≥ 28. If `lex` ≥ 28, `arr` is [1, 26] or [26, 26], and `info` is updated to [[1, 1, lex - 26]] if 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, or [[26, 26, lex - 52]] if 52 ≤ `lex` < 78, or [[26, 26, lex - 78]] if `lex` ≥ 78. If `lex` > 78, `info` and `arr` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `arr` is either [1, 1], [26, 1], [1, 26], or [26, 26]. If `lex` < 28, `arr` is [1, 1] or [26, 1], `lex` is the input integer minus 1, and `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 1]]. If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is [1, 1, 26] or [26, 1, 26], `lex` is the input integer minus 27, and `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 27]]. If 52 ≤ `lex` < 78, `arr` is [1, 26, 26] or [26, 26, 26], `lex` is the input integer minus 27, and `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 27]]. If `lex` ≥ 78, `arr` is [26, 26, 26], `lex` is the input integer minus 27, and `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 53]]. If `lex` > 78, `info` and `arr` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
