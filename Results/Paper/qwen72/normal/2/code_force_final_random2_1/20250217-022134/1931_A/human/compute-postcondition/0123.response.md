Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value. If `lex` ≤ 78, `lex` is reduced by 26, and `arr` is [1] if the original `lex` was less than 28, [26] if the original `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive), or [26] if the original `lex` was between 52 and 78 (inclusive). If `lex` > 78, `arr` remains an empty list and `lex` is the input integer.***
