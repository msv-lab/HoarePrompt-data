The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `cases` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `cases` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 1, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers, `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration, `i` is 1, `temp` is now a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[0][0] + 96`, `info[0][1] + 96`, and `info[0][2] + 96`, `j` is 2**
