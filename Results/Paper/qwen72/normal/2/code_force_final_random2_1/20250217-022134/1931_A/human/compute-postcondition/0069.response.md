The value of `lex` is reduced by 26. Since the initial value of `lex` can be less than 28, between 28 and 51, or between 52 and 78, we need to consider each case:

1. If `lex` is less than 28, then `lex` will become a negative number or a positive number less than 28.
2. If `lex` is between 28 and 51, then `lex` will become a number between 2 and 25.
3. If `lex` is between 52 and 78, then `lex` will become a number between 26 and 52.

The other variables (`n`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `arr`, and `info`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `arr` is [1, 26] or [26, 26], `info` is [[1, 1, lex]] if the original `lex` < 28, or [[26, 26, lex - 52]] if 28 ≤ original `lex` < 52, or [[26, 26, lex - 78]] if original `lex` ≥ 52, and `lex` is the original `lex` - 26.**
