Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `lex` is `lex - 26`, and `arr` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26, while the other variables (`n`, `cases`, `info`, `i`, `j`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
