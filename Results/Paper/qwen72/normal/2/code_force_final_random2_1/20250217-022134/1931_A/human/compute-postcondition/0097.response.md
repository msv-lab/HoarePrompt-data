Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `arr` is [26], `lex` is now `lex - 26` (which is between -24 and 26), `info` is updated to include the new list `[26]` appended to its existing value, and `lex` is greater than or equal to 28.**

Explanation:
- `lex` was initially less than 52 and greater than or equal to 28.
- After executing `lex = lex - 26`, the new value of `lex` is `lex - 26`.
- Since `lex` was between 28 and 51 (inclusive), the new value of `lex` will be between 2 and 25 (inclusive).
- All other variables (`n`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `arr`, and `info`) remain unchanged.
