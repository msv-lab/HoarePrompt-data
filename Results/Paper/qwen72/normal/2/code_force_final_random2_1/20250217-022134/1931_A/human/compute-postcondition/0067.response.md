The value of `lex` is reduced by 26. Since the initial value of `lex` is less than 28, subtracting 26 from `lex` results in a new value for `lex` that is less than 2 (specifically, `lex - 26`). The conditions for `info` remain unchanged because the value of `lex` is still less than 28 after the subtraction. All other variables (`n`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `arr`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `arr` is either [1, 26] or [26, 26], `lex` is an integer where `lex - 26` is less than 2, and `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 26]].**
