Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 1, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers, `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration, `i` is 2, `temp` is now a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[2][0] + 96`, `info[2][1] + 96`, and `info[2][2] + 96`, `j` is 3.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 3 to 78.
- The variable `cases` is still greater than 1.
- The variable `info` is still a list containing `cases` sublists, with each sublist being a sorted list of three integers.
- The variable `lex` retains its value as the remaining value after the last iteration.
- The variable `i` remains 2.
- The variable `temp` is now a string that contains three characters, each corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[2][0] + 96`, `info[2][1] + 96`, and `info[2][2] + 96`.
- The variable `j` is now 3, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
