Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is the initial input integer, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers representing the values of `lex` after processing, and `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration. The variables `i` and `j` are not relevant outside the loop context.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`cases`**: Remains the same as the initial input integer, as it is only used to control the loop's iteration count.
- **`info`**: After all iterations, `info` contains `cases` sublists. Each sublist represents the processed values of `lex` for each iteration, sorted in ascending order.
- **`lex`**: For each iteration, `lex` is reduced based on the conditions in the inner loop. The final value of `lex` in each sublist is the remaining value after the inner loop has processed it.
- **`i` and `j`**: These variables are loop counters and are not relevant outside the loop context. They do not affect the final state of the program.
