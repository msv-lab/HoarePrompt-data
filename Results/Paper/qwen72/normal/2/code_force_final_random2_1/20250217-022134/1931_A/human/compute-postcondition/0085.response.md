The `arr.sort()` function sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Given the possible values of `arr` as [1, 1, lex], [26, 1, lex], [1, 26, lex], [26, 26, lex], or [26, 26, lex], the sorting will depend on the value of `lex`. However, since `lex` is an integer, the sorting will primarily affect the numerical values 1 and 26.

Let's consider each case:

1. **If `arr` is [1, 1, lex]**:
   - Sorting does not change the order since 1 is already the smallest value and `lex` is an integer.
   - Output: [1, 1, lex]

2. **If `arr` is [26, 1, lex]**:
   - Sorting will place 1 first, followed by 26, and then `lex`.
   - Output: [1, 26, lex]

3. **If `arr` is [1, 26, lex]**:
   - Sorting will place 1 first, followed by 26, and then `lex`.
   - Output: [1, 26, lex]

4. **If `arr` is [26, 26, lex]**:
   - Sorting does not change the order since 26 is already the largest value and `lex` is an integer.
   - Output: [26, 26, lex]

Given these cases, the output state will be:

- `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78
- `cases` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `arr` is sorted to one of the following: [1, 1, lex], [1, 26, lex], [26, 26, lex]
- `lex` is the input integer minus 2, 52, or 52 (as per the conditions)
- `info` is either [[1, 1, lex - 2]], [[1, 1, lex - 52]], [[26, 26, lex - 52]], or [[26, 26, lex - 52]], depending on the initial value of `lex`

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is sorted to one of the following: [1, 1, lex], [1, 26, lex], [26, 26, lex], `lex` is the input integer minus 2, 52, or 52 (as per the conditions), and `info` is either [[1, 1, lex - 2]], [[1, 1, lex - 52]], [[26, 26, lex - 52]], or [[26, 26, lex - 52]], depending on the initial value of `lex`.**
