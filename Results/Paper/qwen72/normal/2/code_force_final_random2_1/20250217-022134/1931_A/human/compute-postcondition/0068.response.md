The code `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` is either [1] or [26]. After appending 26, `arr` will be [1, 26] if it was initially [1], or [26, 26] if it was initially [26]. The other variables (`n`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `info`, and `lex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `arr` is [1, 26] or [26, 26], `info` is [[1, 1, lex]] if `lex` < 28, or [[26, 26, lex - 52]] if 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, or [[26, 26, lex - 78]] if `lex` ≥ 52, and `lex` is an input integer with the current value of `lex` being less than 28, or an integer where 28 ≤ lex ≤ 51, or an integer where 28 ≤ lex ≤ 78.**
