Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 1, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers, `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration, `i` is 1, `temp` is now a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[1][1] + 96`, and `info[1][2] + 96`, `j` is 2.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `temp` will contain a string with three characters. These characters correspond to the ASCII values of the elements in the second sublist of `info` (i.e., `info[1]`) plus 96. The loop counter `j` will be 2, indicating that the loop has completed its three iterations. All other variables (`n`, `cases`, `info`, and `lex`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
