Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `lex` < 28, `arr` is [1, 1] and `lex` is reduced by 2, making `lex` less than 26. If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is reduced by 52, making `lex` negative or zero. If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is reduced by 52, making `lex` between 0 and 26. If `lex` > 78, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is reduced by 52, making `lex` greater than 26 but less than or equal to 78.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs exactly 2 times because it is defined as `for j in range(2)`.
- After the first iteration, `lex` is updated based on its initial value:
  - If `lex` < 28, `arr` becomes [1] and `lex` is reduced by 1.
  - If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` becomes [26] and `lex` is reduced by 26.
  - If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` becomes [26] and `lex` is reduced by 26.
  - If `lex` > 78, `arr` becomes [26] and `lex` is reduced by 26.
- After the second iteration, `lex` is updated again based on its new value:
  - If `lex` < 28, `arr` becomes [1, 1] and `lex` is further reduced by 1, making `lex` less than 26.
  - If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` becomes [26, 26] and `lex` is further reduced by 26, making `lex` negative or zero.
  - If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` becomes [26, 26] and `lex` is further reduced by 26, making `lex` between 0 and 26.
  - If `lex` > 78, `arr` becomes [26, 26] and `lex` is further reduced by 26, making `lex` greater than 26 but less than or equal to 78.
- The variables `n`, `cases`, `info`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
