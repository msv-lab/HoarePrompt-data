Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 1, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers, `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration, `i` is 1, `temp` is an empty string, `j` is 2.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `temp = ''` resets the variable `temp` to an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
