Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 78]], `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is [26], `lex` is an integer where 2 ≤ lex ≤ 52.**

Explanation:
- The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. Since the initial value of `lex` was between 28 and 78 (inclusive) and greater than or equal to 52, subtracting 26 from `lex` results in a new value of `lex` that ranges from 2 to 52.
- All other variables (`n`, `cases`, `info`, `i`, `j`, `arr`) remain unchanged.
