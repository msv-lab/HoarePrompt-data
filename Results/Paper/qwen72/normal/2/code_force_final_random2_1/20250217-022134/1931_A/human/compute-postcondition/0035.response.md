The code `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`. This operation does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `lex` remains unchanged, `arr` now contains [26]**.
