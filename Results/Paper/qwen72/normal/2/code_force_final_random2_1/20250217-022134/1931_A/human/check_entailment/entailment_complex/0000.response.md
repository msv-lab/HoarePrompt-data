Reasoning:

The program aims to decode an integer back into a lexicographically smallest three-letter word based on the encoding rules provided. The key steps involve breaking down the integer into three parts that represent the positions of the letters in the alphabet, ensuring the result is the smallest possible word.

However, there are some issues with the logic in the program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Lexicographical Order**: The program attempts to break down the integer `lex` into three parts by checking conditions and appending fixed values (1 or 26) to the array `arr`. This approach does not always ensure the lexicographically smallest word. For example, if `lex` is 24, the program might incorrectly append 1, 1, and 22 instead of 1, 1, and 22 (which is correct but not the smallest).

2. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array `arr` after appending the values can lead to incorrect results. For instance, if `lex` is 24, the correct breakdown is 1, 1, and 22, but sorting it will give 1, 1, 22, which is not the smallest lexicographical order.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Breaking Down `lex`**: The logic for breaking down `lex` into three parts is flawed. It should consider the smallest possible values for the first two letters and then calculate the third letter accordingly.

To fix these issues, the program should:

- Start by assigning the smallest possible value (1) to the first two letters.
- Calculate the third letter based on the remaining value of `lex`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        
        # Initialize the three parts
        a = 1
        b = 1
        c = lex - 2
        
        # Ensure c is within the valid range [1, 26]
        while c > 26:
            b += 1
            c -= 26
        
        # Append the values to the info list
        info.append([a, b, c])
    
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        for j in range(3):
            temp += chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        print(temp)

# Example usage
func()
```

Explanation of the corrected program:
- **Initialization**: Start with the smallest possible values for the first two letters (`a` and `b`).
- **Calculate the Third Letter**: Subtract the sum of the first two letters from `lex` to get the third letter (`c`). If `c` exceeds 26, increment `b` and adjust `c` accordingly.
- **Store and Print Results**: Store the values in `info` and convert them to characters to form the word.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the original program is:

Correctness: **False**
