Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer minus the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is `k * k / 2`.**

Explanation:
- `i` remains 0.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `m` remains an input integer.
- `k` is updated to `k - s`, where `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`.
- `l` remains a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
- `s` remains the minimum value between `m` and `k`.
- `c` remains `k * k / 2`, but since `k` has been updated, `c` will be recalculated based on the new value of `k`. However, the initial value of `c` is still valid until the next calculation.
