The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `l`. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
