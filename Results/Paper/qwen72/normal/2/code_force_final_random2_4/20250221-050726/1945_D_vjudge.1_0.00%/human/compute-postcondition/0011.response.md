Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_B` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and `lista_B` is in its original order, `lista_A` is a list of integers provided by the user input and has been reversed, `soma_b` is 0, `pref` is now the value of the first element of `lista_A`, and the first element of `lista_A` is less than the first element of `lista_B`.**

The code snippet `soma_b = 0` initializes the variable `soma_b` to 0, which was already the case in the initial state. Therefore, no changes occur in the state of the program. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
