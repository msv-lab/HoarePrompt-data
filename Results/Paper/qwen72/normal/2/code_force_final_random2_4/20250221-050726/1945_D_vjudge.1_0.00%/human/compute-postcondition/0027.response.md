Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is `n - k - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_B` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and `lista_B` is in its original order, `lista_A` is a list of integers provided by the user input and has been reversed, `soma_b` is the sum of the last `n - k - 1` elements of `lista_B` that were not less than the corresponding elements in `lista_A`, and `pref` is the sum of the elements in `lista_A` that were less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B` plus the accumulated `soma_b` values from previous iterations.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The index `i` will be `n - k - 1`, which is the last index the loop will process.
- The variable `soma_b` will hold the sum of the elements in `lista_B` from the start of the loop up to the last iteration where `lista_A[i]` was not less than `lista_B[i]`.
- The variable `pref` will hold the sum of the elements in `lista_A` that were less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B` during the loop, plus any accumulated `soma_b` values from those iterations.
- All other conditions and variables remain as they were initially, except for the changes made within the loop.
