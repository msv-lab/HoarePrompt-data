Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It processes multiple test cases, reads the necessary inputs, and applies a logic that aims to minimize the cost for Kirill to move up to one of the first `m` positions in the queue. The algorithm uses a greedy approach to calculate the minimum cost by considering the costs of moving past each person in the queue. The reversal of the lists and the specific conditions for adding costs from `lista_A` and `lista_B` seem to align with the problem's requirements for minimizing the total cost while ensuring Kirill reaches an acceptable position. Therefore, based on the problem statement and the provided solution, the program is considered correct.
