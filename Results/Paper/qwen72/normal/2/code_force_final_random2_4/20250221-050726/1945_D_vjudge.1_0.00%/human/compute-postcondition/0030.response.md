Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is `n - k - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_B` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and `lista_B` is in its original order, `lista_A` is a list of integers provided by the user input and has been reversed, `soma_b` is the sum of the last `n - k - 1` elements of `lista_B` that were not less than the corresponding elements in `lista_A`, `pref` is the sum of the elements in `lista_A` that were less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B` plus the accumulated `soma_b` values from previous iterations, `resultado` is the minimum value between the previous `resultado` and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.**
