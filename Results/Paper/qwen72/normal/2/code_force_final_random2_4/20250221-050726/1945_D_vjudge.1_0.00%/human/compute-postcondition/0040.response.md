The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, and `lista_B`.

- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
- `lista_A` and `lista_B` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9.
- Both `lista_A` and `lista_B` have been reversed.

Given these constraints, the function's output is not specified in the provided information. However, typically, a function with these parameters might perform some operation involving the elements of `lista_A` and `lista_B` up to the index `k`.

Since the specific output is not provided, I will describe the functionality based on the typical behavior of such functions:

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, and `lista_B`. `n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000. `lista_A` and `lista_B` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, and both lists have been reversed. The function processes these parameters and returns a result based on the elements of `lista_A` and `lista_B` up to the index `k`.**
