### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Kirill starts at the end of a queue of `n` people.
   - He wants to move to one of the first `m` positions.
   - Moving to position `j` from position `i` (where `j < i`) costs `a_j` coins plus `b_k` coins for each `k` such that `j < k < i`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The algorithm reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` to make it easier to handle the positions from the end to the front.
   - It initializes `soma_b` to accumulate the cost of moving through positions and `pref` to store the total cost accumulated so far.
   - For each position from `n-k` to `n-1`, it calculates the minimum cost to move to the desired position.

3. **Step-by-Step Breakdown**:
   - **Input Reading**:
     - `func_1` reads the number of people `n` and the target position `k`.
     - It reads the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` and reverses them.
   - **Cost Calculation**:
     - For the first `n-k` positions, it checks if moving to the current position is cheaper using `a_i` or `b_i`.
     - If `a_i` is cheaper, it adds the cost to `pref` and resets `soma_b`.
     - Otherwise, it adds the cost to `soma_b`.
   - **Final Cost Calculation**:
     - For the remaining positions (`n-k` to `n-1`), it calculates the minimum cost to reach the target position by adding the current `soma_b` and `a_i` to `pref`.
   - **Output**:
     - It prints the minimum cost for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm handles the edge case where `n == m` correctly by ensuring that Kirill doesn't need to move if he is already in the first `m` positions.
   - It also handles the case where `n > m` by calculating the minimum cost to move to one of the first `m` positions.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Validation Using Annotations:
- **Initial State**:
  - `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \le k \le n \le 200,000\).
  - `lista_A` and `lista_B` are lists of integers of length `n` where \(1 \le a_i, b_i \le 10^9\).
  - Both lists are reversed before processing.

- **Loop for First `n-k` Positions**:
  - The loop iterates over the first `n-k` positions.
  - If `a_i` is less than `b_i`, it adds the cost to `pref` and resets `soma_b`.
  - Otherwise, it adds the cost to `soma_b`.

- **Final Loop for Remaining Positions**:
  - The loop iterates over the remaining positions from `n-k` to `n-1`.
  - It calculates the minimum cost to reach the target position by adding the current `soma_b` and `a_i` to `pref`.
  - The minimum cost is stored in `resultado`.

- **Output**:
  - The minimum cost is printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue. The algorithm is efficient and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement. The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state at each step and performs the necessary calculations accurately.

Final: **True**
