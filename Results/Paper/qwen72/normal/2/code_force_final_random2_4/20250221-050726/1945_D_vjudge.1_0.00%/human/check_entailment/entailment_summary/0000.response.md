### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Kirill wants to move up in a queue of `n` people to be within the first `m` positions.
   - He can bribe people to move up, paying different costs depending on his current and target positions.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of bribes.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - Reads `n` and `k` (where `k` is the maximum allowable final position).
     - Reads two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` of length `n`.
     - Reverses both lists.
     - Calculates the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the first `m` positions.
     - The logic involves iterating through the reversed lists and calculating the minimum cost using dynamic programming principles.
     - Prints the result.
   - **`func_2`**:
     - Reads the number of test cases `numero_testes`.
     - Calls `func_1` for each test case.
     - Ensures that the program handles multiple test cases correctly.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Input Handling**: Both functions handle input correctly, reading the necessary data and processing it as required.
   - **Logic Implementation**: `func_1` implements the logic to find the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the first `m` positions. The use of reversed lists and dynamic programming principles ensures that the solution is efficient and correct.
   - **Output**: The result is printed correctly for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
