You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical issue in the way it handles the calculation of the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the optimal position for Kirill to move to is always the last position in the range `[n-k, n-1]`. However, this is not necessarily true, and the program may miss the optimal solution.

### Case Analysis:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
The expected output is `14`, which is correct according to the program. However, consider another input:
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
Here, the program will output `14`, which is correct. However, if we change the input slightly:
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
The program will still output `14`, but the correct output should be `11` because Kirill can move to position 2 by paying `3` coins to the person at position 2 and `8` coins to the person at position 3, totaling `11` coins.

### Explanation of the Issue:
The program calculates the cost to move to each position from `n-k` to `n-1` and updates the minimum cost. However, it does not correctly account for the possibility that moving to a different position within the range might be cheaper. Specifically, the program does not consider the cumulative cost of moving through intermediate positions correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly, as demonstrated by the example above. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
