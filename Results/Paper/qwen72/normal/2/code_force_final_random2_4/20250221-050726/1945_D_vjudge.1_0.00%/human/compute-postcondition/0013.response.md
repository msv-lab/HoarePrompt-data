Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_B` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and `lista_B` is in its original order, `lista_A` is a list of integers provided by the user input and has been reversed, `soma_b` is now equal to the first element of `lista_B`, `pref` is 0, and the first element of `lista_A` is greater than or equal to the first element of `lista_B`.**
