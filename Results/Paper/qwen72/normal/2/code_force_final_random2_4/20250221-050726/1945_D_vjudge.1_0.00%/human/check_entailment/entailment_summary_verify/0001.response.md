### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Kirill starts at the end of a queue of `n` people.
   - He wants to move to one of the first `m` positions.
   - Moving to position `j` from position `i` (where `j < i`) costs `a_j` coins plus `b_k` coins for each `k` such that `j < k < i`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The algorithm reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` to make it easier to handle the positions from the end to the front.
   - It initializes `soma_b` to accumulate the cost of moving through positions and `pref` to store the total cost accumulated so far.
   - For each position from `n-k` to `n-1`, it calculates the minimum cost to move to the desired position.

3. **Step-by-Step Breakdown**:
   - **Input Reading**:
     - `func_1` reads the number of people `n` and the target position `k`.
     - It reads the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` and reverses them.
   - **Cost Calculation**:
     - For the first `n-k` positions, it checks if moving to the current position is cheaper using `a_i` or `b_i`.
     - If `a_i` is cheaper, it adds the cost to `pref` and resets `soma_b`.
     - Otherwise, it adds the cost to `soma_b`.
   - **Final Cost Calculation**:
     - For the remaining positions (`n-k` to `n-1`), it calculates the minimum cost to reach the target position by adding the current `soma_b` and `a_i` to `pref`.
   - **Output**:
     - It prints the minimum cost for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm handles the edge case where `n == m` correctly by ensuring that Kirill doesn't need to move if he is already in the first `m` positions.
   - It also handles the case where `n > m` by calculating the minimum cost to move to one of the first `m` positions.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Verification Using Function Summaries:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - Reads `n` and `k` from input.
  - Reads and reverses `lista_A` and `lista_B`.
  - Initializes `soma_b` and `pref`.
  - Iterates through the first `n-k` positions to calculate the cost.
  - Iterates through the remaining positions to find the minimum cost.
  - Prints the minimum cost.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - Reads the number of test cases `numero_testes`.
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly reads the input and reverses the lists.
  - It correctly calculates the minimum cost by iterating through the positions and updating the costs.
  - The logic for handling the cost calculation and finding the minimum cost is sound.

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - It ensures that the program processes multiple test cases as required.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue. The algorithm is efficient and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
