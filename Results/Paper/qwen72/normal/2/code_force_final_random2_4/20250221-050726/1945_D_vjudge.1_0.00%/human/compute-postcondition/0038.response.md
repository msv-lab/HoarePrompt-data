Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` is greater than `k`, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_B` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and `lista_B` is in its original order, `lista_A` is a list of integers provided by the user input and has been reversed, `soma_b` is the sum of the last `n - k - 1` elements of `lista_B` that were not less than the corresponding elements in `lista_A` plus the sum of the elements in `lista_B` from index `n - k` to `n - 1`, `pref` is the sum of the elements in `lista_A` that were less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B` plus the accumulated `soma_b` values from previous iterations, `resultado` is the minimum value between the initial `resultado` (which was infinity) and the values of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for each iteration from `i = n - k` to `i = n - 1`.**

This means that after the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 1`, and `soma_b` will include the sum of the elements in `lista_B` from index `n - k` to `n - 1`. The variable `resultado` will hold the minimum value computed from the expression `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` over all iterations of the loop.
