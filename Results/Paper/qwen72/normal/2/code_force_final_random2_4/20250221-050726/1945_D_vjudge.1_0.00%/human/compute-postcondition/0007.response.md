Output State: **`numero_testes` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `func_1()` has been called `numero_testes` times.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `numero_testes` must have been sufficient to allow the loop to run the specified number of times, and the function `func_1()` will have been called exactly `numero_testes` times.
