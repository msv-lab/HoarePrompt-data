To determine what will be printed by the `print(resultado)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 200,000\).
- `lista_B` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\).
- `lista_A` is a list of integers provided by the user input and has been reversed.
- `soma_b` is the sum of the last \(n - k - 1\) elements of `lista_B` that were not less than the corresponding elements in `lista_A` plus the sum of the elements in `lista_B` from index \(n - k\) to \(n - 1\).
- `pref` is the sum of the elements in `lista_A` that were less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B` plus the accumulated `soma_b` values from previous iterations.
- `resultado` is the minimum value between the initial `resultado` (which was infinity) and the values of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for each iteration from \(i = n - k\) to \(i = n - 1\).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `resultado` starts as infinity (`float('inf')`).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates from \(i = n - k\) to \(i = n - 1\).
   - For each iteration, the value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` is computed.
   - `resultado` is updated to the minimum value between the current `resultado` and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.

3. **Final Value of `resultado`**:
   - After the loop completes, `resultado` will hold the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for all \(i\) from \(n - k\) to \(n - 1\).

### Explanation of Variables:
- `soma_b` is the sum of specific elements in `lista_B` based on the conditions described.
- `pref` is the sum of specific elements in `lista_A` and accumulated `soma_b` values.
- `resultado` is the minimum value of the expression `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` over the specified range of `i`.

### Final Output:
The `print(resultado)` statement will print the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for \(i\) from \(n - k\) to \(n - 1\).

Output: **resultado (where resultado is the minimum value of pref + soma_b + lista_A[i] for i from n - k to n - 1)**
