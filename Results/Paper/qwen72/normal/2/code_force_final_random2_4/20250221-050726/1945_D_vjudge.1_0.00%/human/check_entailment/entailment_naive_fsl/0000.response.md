Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical issue in the way it handles the calculation of the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the optimal position for Kirill to move to is always the last position in the range `[n-k, n-1]`. However, this is not necessarily true, and the program may miss the optimal solution.

### Case Analysis:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
The expected output is `14`, which is correct according to the program. However, consider another input:
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
Here, the program will output `14`, which is correct. However, if we change the input slightly:
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
The program will still output `14`, but the correct output should be `11` because Kirill can move to position 2 by paying `3` coins to the person at position 2 and `8` coins to the person at position 3, totaling `11` coins.

### Explanation of the Issue:
The program calculates the cost to move to each position from `n-k` to `n-1` and updates the minimum cost. However, it does not correctly account for the possibility that moving to a different position within the range might be cheaper. Specifically, the program does not consider the cumulative cost of moving through intermediate positions correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly, as demonstrated by the example above. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
