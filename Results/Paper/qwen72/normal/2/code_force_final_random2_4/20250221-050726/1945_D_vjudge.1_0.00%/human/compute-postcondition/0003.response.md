The only variable in the loop head is `numero_testes`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `numero_testes`. If `numero_testes` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numero_testes` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `numero_testes` must still be greater than 0.

However, since the loop uses `_` as the iterator variable, it indicates that the specific value of the iterator is not used within the loop body. The loop simply runs `numero_testes` times. After each iteration, the value of `numero_testes` itself does not change, but the number of remaining iterations decreases by 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `numero_testes` must be greater than 1 (since it has already run once).

State: **`numero_testes` must be greater than 1, `func_1()` has been called.**
