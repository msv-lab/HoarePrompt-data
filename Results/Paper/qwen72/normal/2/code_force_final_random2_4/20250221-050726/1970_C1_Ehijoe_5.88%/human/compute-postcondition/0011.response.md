Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing `[u]`, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, and the value of `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`.**

Explanation: The code `tree.appendleft(u)` adds the value of `u` to the left end of the deque `tree`. As a result, `tree` now contains the single element `u`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `v` is still equal to the first element of `tree`, which is now `u`.
