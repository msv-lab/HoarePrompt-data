The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. However, based on the problem description, it is implied that the function operates with external inputs consisting of: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, an integer `t` (t=1) indicating the number of rounds, `n-1` pairs of integers (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) describing the edges of the tree, and a single integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) indicating the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.

The function processes these inputs to determine the outcome based on the structure of the tree and the starting node. Since the exact output is not specified in the problem statement, we can infer that the function likely returns some result related to the traversal or properties of the tree starting from the given node.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` implicitly operates with external inputs including the number of nodes `n`, the number of rounds `t`, the edges of the tree, and the starting node `u_1`. It returns a result based on the traversal or properties of the tree starting from the given node.**
