The code `tree.append(u)` adds the value of `u` to the right end of the deque `tree`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque containing `u` appended to its right end.**
