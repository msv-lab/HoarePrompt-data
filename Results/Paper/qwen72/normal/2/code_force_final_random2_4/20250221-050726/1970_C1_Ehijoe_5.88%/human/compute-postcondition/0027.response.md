The code snippet `u, v = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 200000
- `t` is 1
- `i` is 1
- `u` is an input integer
- `v` is an input integer
- If `empty` is True, `tree` is a deque containing `[u, v]`, and `empty` is False
- If `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque, and `empty` is False
- If `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `[u]`
- Otherwise, if `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `[u]` and `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`
- If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` has `v` as its first element, and `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`
- If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `[u, v]`
- If `u` is neither the first nor the last element of `tree`, then `tree` remains unchanged

After executing the code snippet:
- `u` and `v` are updated with new input values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `i` is 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque. The conditions related to `tree` and `u`, `v` remain unchanged.**
