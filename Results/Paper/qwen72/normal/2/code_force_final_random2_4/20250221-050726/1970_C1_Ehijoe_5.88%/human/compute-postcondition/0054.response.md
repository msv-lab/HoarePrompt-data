Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `u` and `v` are the last input integers processed, `empty` is False, and `tree` is a deque containing the elements in a specific order based on the input pairs `(u, v)` such that each `u` or `v` is added to the appropriate end of `tree` according to the rules defined in the loop.**

Explanation:
- The variable `n` remains an integer between 2 and 200000.
- The variable `t` remains 1, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The loop index `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes, indicating that the loop has run `n-1` times.
- The variables `u` and `v` will hold the values of the last input pair processed by the loop.
- The variable `empty` will be False because the deque `tree` is populated during the first iteration and remains non-empty thereafter.
- The deque `tree` will contain elements in a specific order based on the input pairs `(u, v)`. Each pair is processed such that:
  - If `empty` is True (only during the first iteration), both `u` and `v` are appended to `tree`.
  - If `v` matches the first element of `tree`, `u` is added to the left side of `tree`.
  - If `v` matches the last element of `tree`, `u` is appended to the right end of `tree`.
  - If `u` matches the first element of `tree`, `v` is added to the left side of `tree`.
  - If `u` matches the last element of `tree`, `v` is appended to the right end of `tree`.
  - If none of these conditions are met, the deque `tree` remains unchanged for that iteration.
