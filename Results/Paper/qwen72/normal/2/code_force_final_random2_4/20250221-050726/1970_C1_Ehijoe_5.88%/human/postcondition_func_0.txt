The function `func_1` reads input data representing a tree structure and a starting node. It constructs a deque based on the tree's edges, ensuring that nodes are added to the deque in a specific order. After constructing the deque, the function determines the position of the starting node within the deque and calculates possible moves based on the starting position and the length of the deque. Depending on whether the calculated moves include an odd number, the function prints either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value; its primary output is the printed result.
