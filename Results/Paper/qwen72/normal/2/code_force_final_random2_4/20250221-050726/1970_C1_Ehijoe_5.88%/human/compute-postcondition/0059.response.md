Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer between 2 and 200000.
- `t` is 1.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `u` and `v` are the last input integers processed.
- `empty` is False.
- `tree` is a deque containing elements in a specific order based on the input pairs `(u, v)`.
- `start` is an input integer.
- `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.
- `moves` is `[min(1, idx), min(1, n - idx - 1)]`.
- At least one of the elements in `moves` is odd.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('Ron')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Ron'`.

Output: **Ron**
