Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque containing the original elements plus `v` appended to the right side.** 

Explanation: The code `tree.append(v)` adds the value of `v` to the right side of the deque `tree`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The deque `tree` now includes all its original elements plus the new element `v` at the end.
