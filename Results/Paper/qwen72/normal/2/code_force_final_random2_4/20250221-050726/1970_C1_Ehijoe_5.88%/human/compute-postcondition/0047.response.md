Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque containing `v` at the leftmost position.** 

Explanation: The code `tree.appendleft(v)` adds the value of `v` to the left side of the deque `tree`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Since `empty` is False, `tree` was initially non-empty, and now it contains `v` at the leftmost position.
