Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions. The friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if they are chosen again.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case provides the number of children (n), pairs of friends (m), and excursions (k).
   - For each pair of friends, the indices of the children and their initial friendship value are given.
   - The output should be the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (func_1)**:
     - This function calculates the expected value for a single test case.
     - It iterates over each friendship and calculates the contribution of each friendship to the total expected value.
     - The formula used is \( f \times \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \mod MOD \), which is the sum of the first k natural numbers multiplied by the initial friendship value.
     - However, this formula is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the friendship value increases by 1 only if the same pair is chosen again in subsequent excursions. The correct formula should consider the probability of choosing the same pair again, which is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\) for each pair.

   - **Function 2 (func_2)**:
     - This function handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
     - It prints the result for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The formula \( f \times \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \mod MOD \) is incorrect because it assumes that the friendship value increases linearly with each excursion without considering the probability of reselection.
   - The correct approach should involve calculating the expected increase in friendship value for each pair over k excursions, taking into account the probability of reselection.
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the problem as described.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - When there are no pairs of friends (m = 0), the expected value is 0, which is correctly handled by the formula.
   - However, for non-zero m, the current implementation will produce incorrect results due to the flawed formula.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect and does not produce the expected results for the given problem.

Final: **False**
