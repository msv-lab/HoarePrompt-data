n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of friend pairs, k is an integer representing the number of excursions, and friendships is a list of tuples (a_i, b_i, f_i) where a_i and b_i are the indices of the children who are friends and f_i is their initial friendship value. It is assumed that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 * 10^5, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. All pairs of friends are distinct.
