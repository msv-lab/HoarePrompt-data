The provided code snippet updates the `friendships` list by reading `m` lines of input, where each line contains two integers. These integers are converted to a list of integers and added to the `friendships` list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers
- `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`

After executing the code snippet:
- `friendships` is updated to contain `m` lists, each with two integers read from the input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `result` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers read from the input, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**
