The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the context provided, it is implied that the function might interact with an external input or predefined variables (such as `t`, which represents the number of test cases). Since the function signature does not include any parameters, we focus on the output based on the given constraints.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.

The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, but typically, such a function would process the number of test cases and return some result based on each test case.

Since the exact output is not provided, we can only infer that the function processes a series of test cases and returns a result for each test case. However, without more specific details about the expected output, we cannot provide a precise description of the return value.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4). The function returns results based on the processing of these test cases.**
