Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers read from the input, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**. 

The value of `result` is now the output of the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
