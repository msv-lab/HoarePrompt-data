The code snippet updates the `friendships` list by reading `m` lines of input, where each line contains two integers that are converted to a list and added to `friendships`. The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`. After executing the code, `friendships` will contain `m` lists, each with two integers.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**
