To determine what will be printed by the `print(num)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
   - `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - Each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
   - `loop` must be greater than 0.
   - `iterable` is 0.
   - `innerLoop` must be greater than 0.
   - `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`.
   - `x` is the last integer from the input.
   - `a` is the last integer from the input.
   - `big` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 1.
   - `less` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 2.
   - `no` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 3.
   - `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - k` where `k` is the number of elements in `no` that satisfy the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1.
   - `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2.
   - `no` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 3.
   - `num` is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) - k`, where `k` is the count of elements in `no` that are between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive.

3. **Calculating `num`:**
   - `min(less)` is the minimum value in the list `less`.
   - `max(big)` is the maximum value in the list `big`.
   - `k` is the number of elements in `no` that satisfy the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `num` will be the result of the expression `min(less) - max(big) - k`.

Given the initial state and the definitions, the output of the `print(num)` statement will be the value of `num` as described above.

Output: **num (where num is min(less) - max(big) - k, and k is the number of elements in no that satisfy the condition i <= min(less) and i >= max(big))**
