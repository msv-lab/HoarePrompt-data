Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is greater than 1, `num` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the second integer from the input, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. Otherwise, `no` is a list containing the second integer from the input, and `big` and `less` are empty lists.***
