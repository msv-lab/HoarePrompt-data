The value of `num` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an input integer greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - 1`, `big` contains all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` contains all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` must contain at least one element, `i` is the second element of `no`.**
