Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is the first integer from the input, and `a` is the second integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` contains the second integer from the input (`a`), and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` contains the second integer from the input (`a`), and `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `big` and `less` are empty lists, and `no` contains the second integer from the input (`a`).***
