The code snippet `no.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Given the initial state, `no` is initially `[a]` if `x` is neither 1 nor 2, and an empty list otherwise. After appending `a` to `no`, the new value of `no` will be `[a, a]` if `x` is neither 1 nor 2, and `[a]` if `x` is 1 or 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` must be greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` must be greater than 1, `iterable2` is 1, `num` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `big` is [1] if `x` is 1, `less` is [a] if `x` is 2, `no` is [a, a] if `x` is neither 1 nor 2, otherwise `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is [a].**
