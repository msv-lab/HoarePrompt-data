t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. a denotes the type of constraint: if a=1, k must be ≥ x; if a=2, k must be ≤ x; if a=3, k must be ≠ x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the exact same.
