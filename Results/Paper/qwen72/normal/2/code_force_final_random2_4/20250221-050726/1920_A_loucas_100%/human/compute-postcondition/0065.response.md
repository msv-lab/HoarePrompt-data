The value of `a` is appended to the list `no`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` must be greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `no` contains the value `a`, `num` is 0, and `x` is not equal to 1, and `x` is not equal to 2.**
