Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `big` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 2, `no` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 3, and `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - count`, where `count` is the number of elements in `no` that satisfy the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `no`.
- For each element `i` in `no`, if `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list `big`, then `num` is decremented by 1.
- After all iterations, `num` will be updated to `min(less) - max(big) - count`, where `count` is the number of elements in `no` that satisfy the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `x`, `a`, `big`, `less`, `no`) remain unchanged.
