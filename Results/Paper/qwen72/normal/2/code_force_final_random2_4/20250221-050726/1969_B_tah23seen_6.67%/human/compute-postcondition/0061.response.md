To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition Breakdown:**
   - `left < len(s)`: This ensures that `left` is within the bounds of the string `s`.
   - `s[left] != '1'`: This ensures that the character at index `left` in `s` is not '1'.

2. **Current State:**
   - `sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\).
   - `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order.
   - `left` is an index where a '1' exists in `s` and is less than `len(s)`.
   - `right` is updated to the next index where a '0' exists in `s` or is equal to `len(s)` if no such '0' exists.
   - `left` is now `left + 1`.
   - `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
   - `cost` is increased by the total sum of `right - left + 1` for each iteration until the loop condition is no longer met.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `left` must be less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` must not be '1'.
   - Given that `left` is already incremented by 1, we need to ensure that the new `left` still satisfies the conditions.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `left`.
- Since `left` is already incremented by 1, we need to ensure that the new `left` is still less than `len(s)` and that `s[left]` is not '1'.

Given the current state, the loop can execute one more time if the new `left` (which is `left + 1`) is less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` is not '1'. Therefore, no further adjustments are needed beyond the increment of `left`.

### Final State:
State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `left` is now `left + 1` and is less than `len(s)`, `right` is updated to the next index where a '0' exists in `s` or is equal to `len(s)` if no such '0' exists, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and `cost` is increased by the total sum of `right - left + 1` for each iteration until the loop condition is no longer met.**
