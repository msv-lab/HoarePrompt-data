To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `right < len(s)`**
   - This condition ensures that `right` is within the bounds of the string `s`.
   - Given the initial state, `right` is an index where a '0' exists in `s` and is less than `len(s)`. Therefore, this condition is already satisfied.

2. **Condition 2: `s[right] != '0'`**
   - This condition checks if the character at index `right` in `s` is not '0'.
   - Given the initial state, `right` is an index where a '0' exists in `s`. Therefore, this condition is not satisfied, and the loop will not execute unless we adjust `right`.

### Adjusting the State:
- To make the loop execute, we need to change `right` to an index where `s[right]` is not '0'.
- Since `s` is a binary string and `sChar` contains all characters of `s` in the same order, there must be a '1' in `s` after the current `right` index (because `left` is an index where a '1' exists and `left <= right`).

### Conclusion:
- We need to update `right` to an index where `s[right]` is '1' and `right < len(s)`.

### Final State:
- The state right before the loop should be adjusted as follows:
  - `sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\).
  - `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order.
  - `left` is an index where a '1' exists in `s` and is less than `len(s)`.
  - `right` is updated to an index where a '1' exists in `s` and is less than `len(s)`.
  - `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
  - `cost` is increased by `right - left + 1`.

State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `left` is an index where a '1' exists in `s` and is less than `len(s)`, `right` is updated to an index where a '1' exists in `s` and is less than `len(s)`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and `cost` is increased by `right - left + 1`.**
