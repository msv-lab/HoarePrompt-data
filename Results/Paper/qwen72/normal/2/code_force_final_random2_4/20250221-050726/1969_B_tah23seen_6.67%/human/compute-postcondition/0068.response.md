The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sChar`, which is a binary string consisting of '0' and '1' with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5. The function calculates the total sum of `right - left + 1` for each iteration, where `left` is the number of '1's in the string `sChar`, and `right` is the length of the string `sChar`. The function returns this total sum.

Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string `sChar` and returns the total sum of `right - left + 1` for each iteration, where `left` is the number of '1's in the string, and `right` is the length of the string.**
