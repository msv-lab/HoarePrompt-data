The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`sChar`, `s`, `left`) remain unchanged. Since `right` was initially defined as the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found, plus 1, the new value of `right` is now one more than its original value.

Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` or `len(s)` if no '1' is found, `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found, plus 2.**
