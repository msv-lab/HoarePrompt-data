Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 3 and at most 2 * 10^5, `i` is the third character of `sChar`, `s` is a list containing the first, second, and third characters of `sChar`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the third character of `sChar` (stored in `i`) to the list `s`, which initially contained the first and second characters of `sChar`. After the execution, `s` now contains the first, second, and third characters of `sChar`. The values of `sChar` and `i` remain unchanged.
