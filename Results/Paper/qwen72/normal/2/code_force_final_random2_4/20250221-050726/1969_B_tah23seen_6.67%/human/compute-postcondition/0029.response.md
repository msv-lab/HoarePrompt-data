Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar`, `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` or `len(s)` if no '1' is found, `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found, `cost` is 2.**

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `left` until it finds the first '1' in the list `s`. If no '1' is found, `left` will be set to `len(s)`. The variable `right` remains unchanged throughout the loop, as it is determined before the loop starts and is not modified within the loop. The variable `cost` also remains unchanged. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `left` will point to the first occurrence of '1' in `s`, or it will be equal to `len(s)` if no '1' is found.
