Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` with the characters at indices `left` and `right` swapped, `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` or `len(s)` if no '1' is found, `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found, `cost` is `2 + (right - left + 1)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cost` is updated by adding `right - left + 1` to its current value.
- The initial value of `cost` is 2.
- The new value of `cost` is `2 + (right - left + 1)`.
- All other variables (`sChar`, `s`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged.
