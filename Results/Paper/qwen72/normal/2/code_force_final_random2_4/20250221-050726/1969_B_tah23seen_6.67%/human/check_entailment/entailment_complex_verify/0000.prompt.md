You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a binary string (consisting of '0' and '1') with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar`.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, but with all '1's moved to the front and all '0's moved to the back, `left` is equal to the number of '1's in `s`, `right` is equal to `len(s)`, and `cost` is the total sum of `right - left + 1` for each iteration until the loop condition is no longer met.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total sum of `right - left + 1` for each iteration until the loop condition is no longer met, where `left` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, and `right` is the length of the string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a binary string `sChar` as input and returns an integer representing the total cost of rearranging the string such that all '1's are moved to the front and all '0's are moved to the back. The cost is calculated as the sum of `(right - left + 1)` for each swap operation performed during the rearrangement process. After the function executes, the input string `sChar` remains unchanged, but internally, the function creates a list `s` that initially contains the characters of `sChar` in the same order. By the end of the function, `s` will have all '1's at the beginning and all '0's at the end, and the variable `left` will hold the number of '1's in the string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for swapping elements and calculating the cost is flawed. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Swapping Logic**: The program swaps elements `s[right]` and `s[left]` whenever `s[right] == '0'` and `s[left] == '1'`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the string will be sorted in non-descending order after all possible swaps. For example, consider the string `101011`. The program might swap elements incorrectly, leading to an unsorted string.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation `cost += right - left + 1` is not always correct. The cost should be the length of the substring being cyclically shifted, but the current implementation might not always reflect the correct length of the substring being shifted.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if the string is already sorted, the program should return 0, but it might not do so correctly due to the flawed logic.

### Example Case:
Consider the input string `101011`:
- The program might swap elements incorrectly, leading to an unsorted string.
- The correct output should be 5, but the program might produce a different result due to the flawed logic.

To ensure the program is correct, it should:
- Correctly identify and handle all possible substrings that need to be cyclically shifted.
- Ensure the string is sorted in non-descending order after all operations.
- Calculate the cost accurately based on the length of the substrings being shifted.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
