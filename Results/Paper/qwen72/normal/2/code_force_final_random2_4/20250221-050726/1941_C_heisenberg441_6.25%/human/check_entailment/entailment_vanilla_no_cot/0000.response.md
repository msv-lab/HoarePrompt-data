Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it fails to handle certain edge cases and does not always produce the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. Specifically:

1. **Handling Overlapping Substrings**: The function `func_1` only removes the first occurrence of "map" or "pie" and then continues searching from the start again. This approach can lead to suboptimal solutions when there are overlapping substrings. For example, in the string "mappppie", the function will remove "map" first, resulting in "pppie". Then it will remove "pie", resulting in "ppp". However, a more optimal solution would be to remove the overlapping part to get "mpppie" and then remove "pie" to get "mpp".

2. **Special Case Handling**: The special case `if s == 'mapie': return 1` is unnecessary and incorrect. It handles a specific string but does not generalize well to other cases.

3. **Efficiency**: The current implementation is inefficient because it repeatedly searches for substrings and modifies the string, which can be costly for large strings.

A more efficient and correct approach would involve using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie".

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    def min_deletions_to_beautiful(s):
        dp = [0] * (len(s) + 1)
        
        for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1]
            if i >= 3 and s[i-3:i] == "map":
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 3] + 1)
            if i >= 3 and s[i-3:i] == "pie":
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 3] + 1)
        
        return dp[len(s)]
    
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        print(min_deletions_to_beautiful(s))
```

This version uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
