To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop condition.

### Program State Before the Loop:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and does not contain the substring 'map'.
- `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s`.

### While Loop Condition:
```python
while s.find('pie') != -1:
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute as long as the substring 'pie' is found in the string `s`.
- The current state of `s` is that it does not contain the substring 'map'. However, this does not provide any information about whether `s` contains the substring 'pie'.
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, `s` must contain the substring 'pie'.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since the only object in the loop head is `s`, we need to adjust `s` to ensure it contains the substring 'pie'.

### Final State:
- `s` must contain the substring 'pie' for the loop to execute at least once.
- The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop condition.

### Final Answer:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and contains the substring 'pie', `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s`**
