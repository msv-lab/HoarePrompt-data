### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate or not.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
- The goal is to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful (i.e., not containing "pie" or "map").
- The function `func_1` is supposed to return the minimum number of deletions required to achieve this.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Special Case Handling:**
   ```python
   if s == 'mapie':
       return 1
   ```
   This special case is problematic. The string "mapie" contains both "map" and "pie". To make it beautiful, we need to remove at least 2 characters (one from "map" and one from "pie"). However, the function returns 1, which is incorrect.

2. **General Case Handling:**
   ```python
   ans = 0
   while s.find('map') != -1:
       s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
       ans += 1
   while s.find('pie') != -1:
       s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
       ans += 1
   return ans
   ```
   - The function iteratively removes all occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string `s`.
   - For each occurrence of "map" or "pie", it increments the `ans` counter by 1.
   - This part of the function is logically correct and will ensure that the string `s` does not contain "map" or "pie" after the function completes.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` correctly handles the general case of removing "map" and "pie" substrings.
- However, the special case handling for "mapie" is incorrect.

#### Test Case Verification:
- **Test Case: `s = "mapie"`**
  - Expected Output: `2`
  - Actual Output: `1`
  - This test case confirms the original assessment that the program is incorrect due to the special case handling.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it fails to handle the special case where the string is "mapie". The function should return 2 instead of 1 for this case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
