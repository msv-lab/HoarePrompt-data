The code modifies the string `s` by removing the first occurrence of the substring 'pie' and only keeping the part before 'pie' and the part after the first character of 'pie'. This means the substring 'pie' is effectively shortened to 'p'.

Output State: **`s` no longer contains the substring 'pie' at the original position, instead it contains 'p' at that position, `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s` plus 1.**
