### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of deletions needed to make a string beautiful by removing the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain these substrings.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` to compute the minimum number of deletions required.

3. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - The function checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If so, it returns 1. This special case is unnecessary and can be misleading.
   - The function initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of deletions.
   - It uses a `while` loop to find and remove occurrences of the substring "map" by slicing the string and incrementing `ans` by 1 for each removal.
   - Similarly, it uses another `while` loop to find and remove occurrences of the substring "pie" by slicing the string and incrementing `ans` by 1 for each removal.
   - Finally, it returns `ans`.

4. **Issues with the Program**:
   - The special case `if s == 'mapie': return 1` is unnecessary and can be removed. This special case does not add any value to the solution and can be misleading.
   - The program correctly identifies and removes the substrings "map" and "pie" one at a time, but it does not handle overlapping occurrences efficiently. For example, in the string "mapmap", the current implementation will remove "map" twice, but it could be more efficient by removing fewer characters.
   - The program may not be optimal for large strings because it repeatedly slices the string, which can be costly in terms of time complexity.

5. **Efficiency Consideration**:
   - The current implementation may not be optimal for large strings because it repeatedly slices the string, which can be costly in terms of time complexity.
   - A more efficient approach would be to use a single pass through the string to count the minimum deletions required to avoid both "map" and "pie".

### Conclusion:
The program is **partially correct** but not optimal. It handles the basic logic of removing "map" and "pie" substrings, but it can be improved for efficiency and to handle edge cases better.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Suggested Improvement:
A more efficient approach would be to use a single pass through the string to count the minimum deletions required to avoid both "map" and "pie". Here is an improved version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(s) - 2:
        if s[i:i+3] == "map":
            ans += 1
            i += 3  # Skip the next three characters
        elif s[i:i+3] == "pie":
            ans += 1
            i += 3  # Skip the next three characters
        else:
            i += 1
    return ans
```

This version ensures that we only count the minimum deletions required and handles overlapping occurrences more efficiently.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
