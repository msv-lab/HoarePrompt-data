The only variable in the loop head is `s`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute again if `s` contains the substring 'map'. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and contains the substring 'ap' instead of 'map'. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `s` must contain the substring 'map'.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and contains the substring 'map', `ans` is 2**
