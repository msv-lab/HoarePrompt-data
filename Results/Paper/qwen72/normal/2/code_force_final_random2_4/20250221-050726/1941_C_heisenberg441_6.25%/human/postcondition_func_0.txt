The function `func_1` takes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters as input. If `s` is exactly "mapie", the function returns 1. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" from `s`, counting the total number of removals. The function then returns this count. After the function concludes, `s` will no longer contain the substrings "map" or "pie", and the return value represents the number of times these substrings were found and removed.
