Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the minimum value `a` is not the value of `a_{1,1}`. The function `func_1` assumes that the minimum value in the list `l` is `a_{1,1}`, but this is not necessarily true. The value `a_{1,1}` could be any element in the matrix, and the minimum value in the list `l` might not correspond to `a_{1,1}`.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
3 2 3
1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 25
```
In this case, the minimum value in the list `l` is `1`, but if we assume `a_{1,1} = 1`, the generated matrix would be:
```
1  4  7
3  6  9
5  8  11
```
This does not match the original matrix:
```
1  4  7
10 13 16
19 22 25
```
Thus, the program would incorrectly return "no" for this valid input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
