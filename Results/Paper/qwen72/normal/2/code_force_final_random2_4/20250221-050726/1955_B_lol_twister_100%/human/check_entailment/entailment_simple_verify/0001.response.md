### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires verifying if a given array `b` can form a progressive square with the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`.
   - A progressive square is constructed such that each element \( a_{i,j} \) is calculated as \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l` (the array of integers).
   - It first finds the minimum value `a` in the array `l`. This minimum value is assumed to be \( a_{1,1} \).
   - It then constructs a new list `li` by calculating the values of the progressive square using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + h \cdot d \) for all \( k \) and \( h \) in the range `[0, n)`.
   - Both the original list `l` and the constructed list `li` are sorted.
   - If the sorted lists `l` and `li` are equal, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

3. **Verification Using Annotations:**
   - **Initial State:** Before the function call, `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \le n \le 500 \), `c` and `d` are integers such that \( 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 \), and `l` is a list of \( n^2 \) integers where each integer \( b_i \) satisfies \( 1 \le b_i \le 10^9 \).
   - **Inside `func_1`:**
     - `a = min(l)` correctly identifies the minimum value in the list `l`, which is assumed to be \( a_{1,1} \).
     - The nested loops construct the list `li` by calculating \( a + k \cdot c + h \cdot d \) for all \( k \) and \( h \) in the range `[0, n)`. This correctly generates the elements of the progressive square.
     - Both `l` and `li` are sorted. Sorting ensures that the elements are compared in the same order.
     - The comparison `if l == li:` checks if the sorted lists are identical. If they are, it means the given array `l` can form the progressive square, and the function returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints \( 2 \le n \le 500 \), \( 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 \), and \( 1 \le b_i \le 10^9 \) correctly.
   - The use of sorting ensures that the elements are compared in a consistent manner, which is crucial for the correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It accurately checks if the given array can form a progressive square with the specified parameters.

Final: **True**
