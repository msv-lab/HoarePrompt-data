The code appends a new element to the list `li`. The new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`. Given that `h` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a + k * c`.

The initial state specifies that `li` has `2n-1` elements, and after appending the new element, `li` will have `2n` elements.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is 0, `li` has `2n` elements. The first `n` elements of `li` are `[a, a + d, a + 2 * d, ..., a + (n-1) * d]`, the next `n-1` elements are `[a + (n-1) * c + d * 0, a + (n-1) * c + d * 1, a + (n-1) * c + d * 2, ..., a + (n-1) * c + d * (n-2)]`, and the last element is `a + k * c`.**
