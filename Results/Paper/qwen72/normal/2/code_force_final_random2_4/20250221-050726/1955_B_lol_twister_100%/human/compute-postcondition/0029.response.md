Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a sorted list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a sorted list of n^2 elements. The elements of `li` are arranged in ascending order.**

Explanation: The `l.sort()` function sorts the list `l` in ascending order. Since `l` was initially a list of n^2 integers, after sorting, `l` is now a sorted list of n^2 integers. The minimum value in `l` (which is `a`) remains the same, and the list `li` is already sorted, so it remains unchanged. All other conditions from the initial state remain valid.
