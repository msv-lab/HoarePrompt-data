The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `t` being less than `T`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 0 and `T` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `b`, `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for all \(i\) from 1 to `b` where \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\)**
