The code snippet provided updates the value of `suma` by adding the value of `x` to it. Let's break down the changes:

- `x` is calculated as \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\).
- Given `i` is 3, the formula simplifies to \((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3\) which further simplifies to \((a - 6) // 3\).
- The value of `x` is then added to `suma`.

Since `suma` was not explicitly initialized in the initial state, we assume it starts as 0. After the addition, `suma` will be equal to `x`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `x` is \((a - 6) // 3\), `suma` is \((a - 6) // 3\)**.
