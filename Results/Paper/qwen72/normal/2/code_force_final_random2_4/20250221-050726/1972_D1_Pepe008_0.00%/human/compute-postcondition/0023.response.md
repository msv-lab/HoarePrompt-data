Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `b`, `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for all \(i\) from 1 to `b` where \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\).** 

Explanation: The code snippet `a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])` reassigns the values of `a` and `b` to the integer values of `info[0]` and `info[1]` respectively. Since these values were already defined in the initial state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. All other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain valid and unchanged.
