The code snippet `suma += x` increments the value of `suma` by the value of `x`. Given the initial state, `suma` starts at 0, and `x` is calculated as \((a - (b + 1) \cdot b) // (b + 1)^2 + 1\). After executing the code, `suma` will be equal to `x`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is \((a - (b + 1) \cdot b) // (b + 1)^2 + 1\), `x` is \((a - (b + 1) \cdot b) // (b + 1)^2 + 1\)**.
