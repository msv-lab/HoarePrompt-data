Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop where `x` is \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for each `i` from 1 to `b` inclusive, provided that `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` for each iteration.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = b`.
- For each iteration, `x` is calculated as \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
- If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `x` is added to `suma`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `b + 1` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `b`.
- The variable `suma` will contain the sum of all valid `x` values that were added during the loop.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
