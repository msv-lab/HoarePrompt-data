Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\), `suma` is updated to `suma + x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is calculated as \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\).
- The value of `suma` is updated by adding the value of `x` to its current value.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
