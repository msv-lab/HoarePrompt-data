Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, `suma` is \((a - b \cdot (b - 1)) // b^2 + 1\), `x` is \((a - b \cdot (b - 1)) // b^2 + 1\).**

Explanation:
- The code `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`.
- Initially, `suma` is 0 and `x` is calculated as \((a - b \cdot (b - 1)) // b^2 + 1\).
- After executing the code, `suma` becomes \((a - b \cdot (b - 1)) // b^2 + 1\).
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged.
