Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, and `max` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration. If the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to this minimum value. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.***
