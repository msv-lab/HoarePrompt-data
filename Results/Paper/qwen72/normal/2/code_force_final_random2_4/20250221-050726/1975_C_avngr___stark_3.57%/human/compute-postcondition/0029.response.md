The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `a` is a new list of integers input by the user. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 3), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be greater than 3).

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is 3. If the minimum value between `a[3]` and `a[2]` is greater than the previous `max`, then `max` is updated to this minimum value. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
