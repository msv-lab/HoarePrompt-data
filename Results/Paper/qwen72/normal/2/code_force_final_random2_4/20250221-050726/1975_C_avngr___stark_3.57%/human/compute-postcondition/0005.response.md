The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 (inclusive) and goes up to `n` (exclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` should start at 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `max` is 0, `i` is 1**
