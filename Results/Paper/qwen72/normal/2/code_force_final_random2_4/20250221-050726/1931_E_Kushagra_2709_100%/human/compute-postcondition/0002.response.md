The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `num`. The loop iterates from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`. For the loop to execute, `num` must have at least one character (i.e., `len(num)` must be greater than 0). Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to `len(num) - 1`.

State: **`num` is a string representation of the original integer value of `num` and must have at least 1 character, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, `tot` is 0**
