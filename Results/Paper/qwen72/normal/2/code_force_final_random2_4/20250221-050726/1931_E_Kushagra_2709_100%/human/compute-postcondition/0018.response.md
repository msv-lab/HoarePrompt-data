Functionality: ** The function `zerocnts` accepts an integer `num` and returns the count of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`. After the function concludes, the input `num` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the number of consecutive zeros at the end of the string representation of `num`. If `num` has no trailing zeros, the function returns 0. **
