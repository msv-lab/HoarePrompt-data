The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `num`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the length of `num`. The loop iterates from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, and `num` has at least 1 character. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, and it must still be greater than or equal to 0.

Since `i` was `len(num) - 1` at the end of the last iteration, decrementing `i` by 1 makes `i` equal to `len(num) - 2`. For the loop to continue, `len(num) - 2` must be greater than or equal to 0, meaning `len(num)` must be at least 2.

State: **`num` is a string representation of the original integer value of `num` and has at least 2 characters, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, `tot` is 1**
