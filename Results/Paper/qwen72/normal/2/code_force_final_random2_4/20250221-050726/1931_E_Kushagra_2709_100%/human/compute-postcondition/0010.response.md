The code snippet `tot += 1` increments the value of `tot` by 1. Given that the initial value of `tot` is 1, after executing this code, `tot` will be 2. The other variables (`num` and `i`) remain unchanged. The condition about breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`num` is a string representation of the original integer value of `num` and has at least 2 characters, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, `tot` is 2. If `num[i]` is not '0', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
