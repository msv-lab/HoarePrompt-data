Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.** 

The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user, which must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. The other conditions regarding `t` and `a` remain unchanged.
