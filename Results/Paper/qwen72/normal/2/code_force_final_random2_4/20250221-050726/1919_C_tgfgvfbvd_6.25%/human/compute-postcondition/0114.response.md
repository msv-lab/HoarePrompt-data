Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 1`, and `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` otherwise. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, and `b` remains the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element (or 0 if none exists). Otherwise, `a` remains the first element in `l`, and `b` is updated to `l[x]`. In all cases, the relationships between `a`, `b`, and `l[x]` are maintained according to the conditions evaluated.***
