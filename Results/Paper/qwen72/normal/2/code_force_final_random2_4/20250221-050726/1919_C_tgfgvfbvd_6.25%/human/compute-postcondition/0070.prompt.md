Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is the first integer in the list `l`, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or `n-1` if no such element exists.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is set to 1, and either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`. Otherwise, `c` remains 0, and if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, otherwise `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than `a` or `b` (or both), then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a >= l[x]`, otherwise `b` is updated to `l[x]`. In all cases, `a` and `b` maintain their roles as the first integer in the list `l` and the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or 0 if no such element exists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + k + 1`, and `x` must be less than `n`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then either `a` or `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]` based on the comparison between `l[x] - a` and `l[x] - b`, and `c` is incremented by 1. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then either `a` or `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]` based on the comparison between `a - l[x]` and `b - l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then either `a` or `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]` based on the comparison between `a` and `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + k + 2`, and `x` must be less than `n`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]`, and `c` is incremented by 1. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x] >= a` or `l[x] >= b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, or `b` is set to `l[x]` otherwise.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
