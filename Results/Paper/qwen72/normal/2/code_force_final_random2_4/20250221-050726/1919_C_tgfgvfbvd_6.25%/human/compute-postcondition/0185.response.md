Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index where the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element is found, or `y` is `n-1` if no such element exists, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is the value of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `y` must be such that `y + 1 < n`, `x` is `y + 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `b` remains unchanged. If `a` is less than `l[x]`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `a` remains unchanged. Additionally, `l[x]` is not greater than `a` or `l[x]` is not greater than `b`, and `l[x]` is not less than `a` or `l[x]` is not less than `b`.***
