Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index where the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element is found, or `y` is `n-1` if no such element exists, `a` is the value of `l[x]`, `b` is the value of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `y` must be such that `y + 1 < n`, `x` is `y + 1`, `l[x]` is less than both the previous `a` and `b`, and the difference between the previous `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is updated to be the value of `l[x]`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
