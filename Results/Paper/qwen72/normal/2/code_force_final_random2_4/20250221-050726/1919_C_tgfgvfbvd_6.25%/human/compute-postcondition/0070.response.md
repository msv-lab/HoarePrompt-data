Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or `n-1` if no such element exists, `a` is the last element in `l` that was greater than or equal to the previous elements up to the point where it was updated, `b` is the last element in `l` that was greater than the previous elements up to the point where it was updated, and `c` is the count of how many times an element in `l` was found to be greater than both `a` and `b` during the loop execution.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is used to define the range of the loop but is not modified.
- The list `l` remains unchanged as it is only read and not modified.
- The variable `y` remains unchanged as it is used to define the starting point of the loop but is not modified.
- The variables `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop. `a` is updated to the last element in `l` that was greater than or equal to the previous elements up to the point where it was updated, and `b` is updated to the last element in `l` that was greater than the previous elements up to the point where it was updated.
- The variable `c` is incremented each time an element in `l` is found to be greater than both `a` and `b` during the loop execution. Therefore, `c` represents the count of such occurrences.
