Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 3`, and `y + 3 < n`. If `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, then `a` is the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`. Otherwise, `b` is the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`.***
