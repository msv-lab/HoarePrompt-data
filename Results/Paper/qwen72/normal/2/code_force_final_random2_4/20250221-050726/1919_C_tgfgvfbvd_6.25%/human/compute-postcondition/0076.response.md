Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or `n-1` if no such element exists, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is 0, `c` is the count of how many times an element in `l` was found to be greater than both `a` and `b` during the loop execution.**
