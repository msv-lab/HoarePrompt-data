Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + k + 2`, and `x` must be less than `n`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]`, and `c` is incremented by 1. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x] >= a` or `l[x] >= b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, or `b` is set to `l[x]` otherwise.***
