Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index where the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element is found, or `y` is `n-1` if no such element exists, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is the value of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or 0 if no such element exists, and `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index where the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element is found, or `y` is `n-1` if no such element exists, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is the value of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or 0 if no such element exists, `y` must be such that `y + 1 < n`, `x` is `y + 1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is set to 1. If `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` otherwise. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, and `b` remains unchanged. If `a` is less than `l[x]`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `a` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index where the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element is found, or `y` is `n-1` if no such element exists, `y` must be such that `y + 1 < n`, `x` is `y + 2`, and `x` must be less than `n`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `a` is the value of the element at index `x` in `l` and `b` is the value of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element or 0 if no such element exists, and the value of `c` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `a` is the value of `l[x]` and `b` is the value of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or 0 if no such element exists. If neither of these conditions is met, `a` remains the first element in `l` and `b` is the value of the element `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index where the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element is found, or `y` is `n-1` if no such element exists, `y` must be such that `y + 1 < n`, `x` is `y + 3`, and `x` must be less than `n`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `a` is the value of the element at index `x` in `l`, `b` is the value of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element or 0 if no such element exists, and `c` is incremented by 1. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `a` is the value of `l[x]` and `b` is the value of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element or 0 if no such element exists. If `l[x] >= a` and `l[x] <= b`, then `a` remains the first element in `l` and `b` is the value of the element `l[x]`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] > b`, then `a` is the value of `l[x]` and `b` is the value of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or 0 if no such element exists.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
