Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty. The main issue lies in how the elements are being assigned to `a` and `b`, and how the penalty `c` is being calculated. The algorithm seems to be trying to track two elements (`a` and `b`) and update them based on the current element, but it does not follow a clear strategy to minimize the penalty. Additionally, the logic for updating `a` and `b` and incrementing `c` is flawed and does not align with the problem's requirements.

A correct approach would involve recognizing that the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is to ensure that no increasing pairs are formed within the same subsequence. This can be achieved by placing each element in a subsequence such that it does not form an increasing pair with the previous element in the same subsequence. The correct solution should count the number of increasing pairs in the original array and output this count as the minimum possible penalty, since each increasing pair must be split across different subsequences to avoid contributing to the penalty.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        penalty = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if l[i] > l[i - 1]:
                penalty += 1
        print(penalty)
```

This version correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of increasing pairs in the array.
