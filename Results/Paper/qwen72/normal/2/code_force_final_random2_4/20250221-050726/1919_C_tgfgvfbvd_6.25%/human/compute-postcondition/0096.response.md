Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `a` is `l[x]`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element if such an element exists, otherwise `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `x` is `y + 1`, and the current value of `l[x]` is greater than `a` (which was previously the first element in `l`) and `l[x]` is greater than `b`. Additionally, the difference between `l[x]` and `a` (which was previously the first element in `l`) is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`.**
