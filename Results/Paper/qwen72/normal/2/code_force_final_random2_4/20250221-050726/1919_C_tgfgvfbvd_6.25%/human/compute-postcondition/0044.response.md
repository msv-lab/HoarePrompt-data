To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`.
- The loop iterates over the range `(y + 1, n)`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range starting from `y + 1` to `n - 1`.
- The loop variable `x` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is less than `n`.

### State Adjustments:
- The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was `y + k` where `k` is the number of iterations completed.
- For the next iteration, `x` will be incremented by 1, so it will be `y + k + 1`.
- The loop will execute again if `x` is less than `n`.

### Conclusion:
- `x` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `n` must remain the same for the loop to continue executing.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + k + 1`, and `x` must be less than `n`**.
