### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to split the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the total penalty \( p(s) + p(t) \) is minimized.
   - The penalty \( p(b) \) for an array `b` is defined as the number of indices \( i \) where \( b_i < b_{i+1} \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The solution iterates through the array to find the first increasing pair.
   - It then continues to iterate through the array, adjusting the values of `a` and `b` based on certain conditions.
   - The variable `c` is used to count the number of times the condition \( l[x] > a \) and \( l[x] > b \) is met, which contributes to the penalty.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The logic for updating `a` and `b` seems to be overly complex and may not correctly handle all edge cases.
   - The condition `if l[x] > a and l[x] > b` and subsequent updates to `a` and `b` do not clearly align with the goal of minimizing the penalty.
   - The solution does not explicitly split the array into two subsequences and calculate the penalties for each subsequence separately.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To minimize the penalty, we should aim to split the array such that the number of increasing pairs in both subsequences is minimized.
   - One optimal approach is to split the array such that one subsequence is non-decreasing and the other subsequence is non-increasing. This ensures that the penalty is minimized because there are no increasing pairs within each subsequence.

5. **Simpler Solution**:
   - A simpler and more effective approach would be to count the number of increasing pairs in the entire array and use this count as the penalty. This is because any split that minimizes the number of increasing pairs will result in the minimum penalty.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly handle the problem and may produce incorrect results for various test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.
