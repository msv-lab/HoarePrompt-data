Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` aims to solve the problem by calculating the absolute difference between the number of "+" and "-" characters in the input string `expression`. However, this approach does not correctly implement the required logic for minimizing the penalty as described in the problem statement.

The problem requires splitting the array `a` into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The optimal solution involves finding a way to split the array such that the sum of penalties is minimized.

The current implementation simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of "+" and "-" characters, which does not account for the optimal splitting of the array. For example, in the case where the input string is `"+-+-+"`, the optimal split would be `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1])`, resulting in a total penalty of `0 + 0 + 1 = 1`, but the function returns `0` because it calculates the absolute difference between the counts of "+" and "-" characters.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
