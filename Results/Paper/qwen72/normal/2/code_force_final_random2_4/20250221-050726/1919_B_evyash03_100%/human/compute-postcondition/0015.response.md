Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a string `expression` and an integer `length` as inputs. It calculates the number of "+" characters and the number of "-" characters in `expression`, and returns the absolute difference between these two counts. The function ensures that `expression` is a string of length `length` containing only "+" and "-" characters, and `length` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 5000. After the function executes, the final state is that the absolute difference between the number of "+" and "-" characters in `expression` is returned. **
