Reasoning:  
The provided solution calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `expression`. However, this approach does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The goal is to minimize the total penalty.

The current implementation simply returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is equivalent to the sum of the entire array `a` (since each '+' contributes +1 and each '-' contributes -1). This does not account for the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.

For example, consider the test case `"+-+-+"`. The correct answer should be `0` because the array can be split into `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, and the penalty for each subarray is `0`. However, the provided solution would return `2` (the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-'), which is incorrect.

Therefore, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
