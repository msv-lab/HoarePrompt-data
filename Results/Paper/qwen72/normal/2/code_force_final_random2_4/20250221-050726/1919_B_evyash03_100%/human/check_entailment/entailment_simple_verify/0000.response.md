Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed does not implement the algorithm required to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` merely calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which does not account for the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to consider how to split the array into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The current implementation fails to do this and instead outputs a value that is not related to the optimal penalty calculation.

For instance, in the example provided in the original assessment:
```
6
+-+-+-
```
The correct output should be `0` because the array can be split into `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`, and the penalty for each subarray is `0`. However, the provided program will output `6` because it calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is `|3 - 3| = 0`, and then incorrectly multiplies it by the length of the string, resulting in `6`.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
