Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which is not the same as calculating the minimum possible penalty as defined in the problem statement.

The problem requires splitting the array into subarrays in such a way that the total penalty (sum of penalties of all subarrays) is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The solution should consider different ways to split the array to minimize this penalty, but the given code does not attempt to do this. Instead, it simply returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which does not account for the optimal splitting of the array.

A correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to explore different ways to split the array and calculate the minimum penalty accordingly.
