The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` depends on the first character of `expression`: if the first character is "-", `count` starts at 0; if the first character is "+", `count` starts at 1. After incrementing, `count` will be 1 if the first character was "-", or 2 if the first character was "+". The values of `expression`, `length`, and `char` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` consisting only of characters "+" and "-", `count` is 1 if the first character of `expression` is "-", otherwise `count` is 2 if the first character of `expression` is "+", `char` is the next character in `expression`.**
