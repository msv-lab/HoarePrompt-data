The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `expression`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `expression`. If there are more characters left in `expression`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `expression` is a string of length `length` consisting only of characters "+" and "-", `count` is 1 if the first character of `expression` is "-", otherwise `count` is 2 if the first character of `expression` is "+", and `char` is the next character in `expression`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `expression` must still have at least one more character left to iterate over. Therefore, the length of `expression` must be greater than 1 (since one character has already been processed), and `char` will be the next character in `expression`.

State: **`expression` is a string of length `length - 1` consisting only of characters "+" and "-", `count` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `char` is the next character in `expression`**
