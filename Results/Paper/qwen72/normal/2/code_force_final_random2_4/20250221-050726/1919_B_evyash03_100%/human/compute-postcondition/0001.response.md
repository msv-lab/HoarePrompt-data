The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `expression`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `expression`. If `expression` is not empty (i.e., it has at least one character), the loop will execute. Given that `expression` is a string of length `length` where `1 <= length <= 5000`, this condition is already met. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `expression` itself.

However, for the loop to start, `char` should be set to the first character of `expression`.

State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` consisting only of characters "+" and "-", `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `length` <= 5000, `count` is 0, `char` is the first character of `expression`**
