Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the input values, `min(n, m) >= 2`, `t` is greater than 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `ans` was originally calculated as `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`. However, the code snippet `ans = n` updates `ans` to simply be equal to `n`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `T`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
