### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the function summary in detail to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Calculation of `ans`**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It then iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\).
   - For each \(b\), it adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

#### Function Summary:
- The function reads \(t\), \(n\), and \(m\) from the input.
- It calculates `ans` using the formula `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`.
- It prints the calculated value `ans` for each test case.

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The formula `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` does not correctly account for the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The correct approach involves iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition.

2. **Handling of GCD**:
   - The program does not compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\), which is essential for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Range of Iteration**:
   - The program iterates \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\), but this range might not cover all necessary values of \(b\) for the given constraints.

#### Example Case:
- For the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the correct output should be 3, corresponding to the pairs (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2).
- However, the program will produce an incorrect result because it does not correctly check the condition for valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as described due to the issues identified.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
