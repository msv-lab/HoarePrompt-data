The code snippet `[n, m] = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts using whitespace as the delimiter, and assigns these parts to the variables `n` and `m`. This changes the values of `n` and `m` from their initial state of being positive integers within the specified range to the strings read from the input.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are strings representing the input values, `t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0**
