Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The program calculates `ans` using the formula `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`. This formula does not correctly account for the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The correct approach would involve iterating over possible values of `a` and `b` and checking if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds true.

2. **Handling of GCD**:
   - The program does not compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, which is essential for the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Range of Iteration**:
   - The program iterates `b` from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`, but this range might not cover all necessary values of `b` for the given constraints.

Here is a case where the program fails:
- For the input `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the correct output should be 3, corresponding to the pairs (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). However, the program will produce an incorrect result because it does not correctly check the condition for valid pairs.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges.
2. Compute the GCD of `a` and `b`.
3. Check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
4. Count and print the number of valid pairs for each test case.
