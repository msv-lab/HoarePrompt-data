The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Given that `b` is 3, the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` simplifies to `(n + 3) // 9`. The initial value of `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, which is `n + (n + 3) // 9`. After executing the code, `ans` becomes `n + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 3) // 9`.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is `n + 2 * ((n + 3) // 9)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers converted from their original string representations, `min(n, m) >= 3`, `t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `ans` is equal to `n + 2 * ((n + 3) // 9)`, `b` is 3.**
