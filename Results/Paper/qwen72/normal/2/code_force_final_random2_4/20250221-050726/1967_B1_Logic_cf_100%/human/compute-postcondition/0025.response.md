The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `T` relative to `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is 1 and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `T` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `t` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers, `min(n, m) >= 2`, `t` is greater than 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`**
