To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `b`, and the expression `range(2, min(n, m) + 1)`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(2, min(n, m) + 1)` is not empty.
   - For the range to be non-empty, the upper bound (exclusive) must be greater than the lower bound (inclusive).
   - Therefore, `min(n, m) + 1` must be greater than 2.
   - This simplifies to `min(n, m) >= 2`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `min(n, m) >= 2` for the loop to execute.
   - The initial state provides that `n` and `m` are integers converted from their original string representations.
   - The initial state also provides that `t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, and `ans` is equal to `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- To ensure the loop executes, `n` and `m` must be such that `min(n, m) >= 2`.
- The other variables (`t`, `T`, and `ans`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution condition.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `m` are integers converted from their original string representations, `min(n, m) >= 2`, `t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `ans` is equal to `n`**
