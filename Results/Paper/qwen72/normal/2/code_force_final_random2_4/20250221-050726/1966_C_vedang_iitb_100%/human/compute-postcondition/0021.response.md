To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the `print` statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `tc` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input.
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `mexsize`**:
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that is missing from this list.
   - For example, if `a = [1, 2, 4, 5]`, then `mexsize` would be 3 because 3 is the smallest positive integer not in the list.

2. **Condition in the `print` Statement**:
   - The `print` statement checks if `mexsize % 2 == 1`.
   - This means it checks if `mexsize` is odd.
   - If `mexsize` is odd, it prints 'Alice'.
   - If `mexsize` is even, it prints 'Bob'.

3. **Determining the Value of `mexsize`**:
   - Since `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not in the list `a`, and it is less than or equal to `maxsize`, it can be any positive integer from 1 up to `maxsize`.
   - The parity (odd or even) of `mexsize` depends on the specific values in the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
- The output of the `print` statement will be either 'Alice' or 'Bob' depending on whether `mexsize` is odd or even.
- Without the exact values of the list `a`, we cannot determine the exact value of `mexsize`, but we can describe the output based on the parity of `mexsize`.

Output: **'Alice' if `mexsize` is odd, otherwise 'Bob' (where `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`)**
