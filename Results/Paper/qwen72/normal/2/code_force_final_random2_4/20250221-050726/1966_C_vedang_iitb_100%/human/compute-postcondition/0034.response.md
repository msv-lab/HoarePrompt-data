The value of `mexsize` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `mexsize` could be 1 or 2 depending on the condition involving `sz`. After incrementing, `mexsize` will be 2 or 3, respectively. The values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `sz` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the second element in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 2 or 3 depending on the initial value of `mexsize`.**
