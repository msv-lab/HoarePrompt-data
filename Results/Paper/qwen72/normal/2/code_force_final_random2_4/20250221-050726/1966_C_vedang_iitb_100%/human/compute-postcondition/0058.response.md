The only objects in the loop head are the variable `sz` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. For the loop to execute again, there must be another element in the list `a` that hasn't been processed yet.

At the end of the last iteration, `sz` was the second element of `a`, and `a` must have at least two elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least three elements, and `sz` will be the third element of `a`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least three elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, and `sz` is the third element of `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.**
