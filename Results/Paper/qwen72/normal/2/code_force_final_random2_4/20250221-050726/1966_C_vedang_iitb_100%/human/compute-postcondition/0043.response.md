Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `tc` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `mexsize`:**
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that is missing from this sorted sequence.
   - For example, if `a = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`, then `mexsize` would be 4 because 4 is the smallest positive integer not in the list.

2. **Condition in the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement checks if `mexsize % 2 == 1`.
   - This condition evaluates whether `mexsize` is odd.
   - If `mexsize` is odd, it prints 'Alice'.
   - If `mexsize` is even, it prints 'Bob'.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, it can be either odd or even.
- However, the problem does not specify the exact values in the list `a`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `mexsize` without more information.
- But we can still determine the output based on the parity (odd or even) of `mexsize`.

### Conclusion:
- The output will depend on whether `mexsize` is odd or even.
- If `mexsize` is odd, the output will be 'Alice'.
- If `mexsize` is even, the output will be 'Bob'.

Since the exact value of `mexsize` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the condition:

Output: **'Alice' if `mexsize` is odd, otherwise 'Bob' (where `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`)**
