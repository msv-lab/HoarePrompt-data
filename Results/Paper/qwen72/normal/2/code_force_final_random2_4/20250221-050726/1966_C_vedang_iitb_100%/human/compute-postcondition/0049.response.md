The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `maxsize`, or `mexsize`. However, the order of elements in `a` changes.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the sorted list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, the condition holds as is. If `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`, the condition also holds as is.**
