The value of `mexsize` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that if `sz` (the second element of `a`) is equal to 1, then `mexsize` is updated to 2, otherwise `mexsize` remains 1, the new value of `mexsize` will be 3 if `sz` is 1, or 2 if `sz` is not 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input with at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the second element in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is 3 if `sz` is 1, otherwise `mexsize` is 2.**
