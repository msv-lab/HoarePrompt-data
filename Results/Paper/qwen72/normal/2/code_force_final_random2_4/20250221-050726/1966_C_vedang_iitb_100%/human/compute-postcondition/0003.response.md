The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into multiple strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `tc` is 0
- `n` is an input integer

After executing the code, the variable `a` is updated to contain a list of integers derived from the user's input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input.**
