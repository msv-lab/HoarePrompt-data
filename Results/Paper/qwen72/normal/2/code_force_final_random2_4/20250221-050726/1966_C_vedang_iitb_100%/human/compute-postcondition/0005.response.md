The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `a` but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.**
