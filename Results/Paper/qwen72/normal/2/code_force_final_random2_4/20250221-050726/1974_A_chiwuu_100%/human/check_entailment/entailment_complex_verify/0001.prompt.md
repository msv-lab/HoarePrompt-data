You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `t` will hold the final computed value for each iteration, which is updated based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, `t` starts as `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd. If `t1` (calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`) is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains the same. Otherwise, `t` is adjusted based on the difference `t2` (calculated as `a - t1`). If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`. If `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1`. The variables `a` and `b` are updated with each iteration to the next pair of integers read from the input. The loop will have processed `n` pairs of integers (`a`, `b`), and the final state of `t` will reflect the last computation performed in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. It then calculates a value `t` based on the following rules: if `b` is even, `t` is set to `b // 2`; if `b` is odd, `t` is set to `(b // 2) + 1`. It further adjusts `t` based on the difference between `a` and a calculated value `t1` (which is `t * 15 - b * 4`). If `t1` is less than `a`, `t` is incremented by the ceiling of the division of the difference `a - t1` by 15. Finally, the function prints the computed value of `t` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Screen Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the initial number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the program uses the formula:
     ```python
     t = b
     if t % 2 == 0:
         t = t // 2
     else:
         t = t // 2 + 1
     ```
     This formula ensures that the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons is calculated correctly. If `b` is even, it divides by 2; if odd, it divides by 2 and adds 1.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program then calculates the number of remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons:
     ```python
     t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
     ```
     Here, `t * 15` gives the total number of cells available in `t` screens, and `b * 4` gives the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.

4. **Check if Remaining Cells are Sufficient**:
   - The program checks if the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons:
     ```python
     if t1 >= a:
         t = t
     else:
         t2 = a - t1
         if t2 % 15 == 0:
             t = t + t2 // 15
         else:
             t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
     ```
     - If the remaining cells are sufficient (`t1 >= a`), the number of screens remains `t`.
     - If not, it calculates the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons. The formula `t2 % 15 == 0` ensures that if the remaining cells are exactly divisible by 15, it adds the exact number of screens. Otherwise, it adds one extra screen to account for the remainder.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons and calculates the minimum number of screens required. The logic and calculations are sound and match the problem requirements.
