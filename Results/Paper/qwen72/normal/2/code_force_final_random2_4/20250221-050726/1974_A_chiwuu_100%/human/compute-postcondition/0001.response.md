To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions that affect the loop's ability to run, which are primarily the variables `i` and `n` as they are the only elements in the loop head.

- The variable `i` is initialized by the `range(n)` function, starting from 0.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

The other variables (`t`, `x`, and `y`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, their values are given as part of the problem context, so we should include them in the state description.

Given this, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is set to 0 (as it will be by the `range` function).

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
