To determine what will be printed by the `print(t)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a` is an integer (converted from its original string value).
- `b` is an integer (unchanged from its original integer value).
- `t1` and `t2` are initially defined but their values depend on the conditions described.

### Conditions:
1. **If `t1 >= a`:**
   - `t` remains either `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd.
   - `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4`.

2. **Otherwise:**
   - **If `t2 % 15 == 0`:**
     - `t` is updated to `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`.
     - `t1` is updated to `t * 15 - b * 4`.
     - `t2` is updated to `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.
   - **If `t2 % 15 != 0`:**
     - `t` is updated to `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1`.
     - `t1` is updated to `t * 15 - b * 4`.
     - `t2` is updated to `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.

### Analysis:
1. **If `t1 >= a`:**
   - `t` is determined based on `b`:
     - If `b` is even, `t = b // 2`.
     - If `b` is odd, `t = (b // 2) + 1`.
   - This value of `t` is printed.

2. **Otherwise:**
   - We need to check the value of `t2 % 15`:
     - **If `t2 % 15 == 0`:**
       - `t` is updated to `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`.
     - **If `t2 % 15 != 0`:**
       - `t` is updated to `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1`.
   - The updated value of `t` is printed.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `t2` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables and the conditions they satisfy.

Output: **t (where t is determined as follows: if t1 >= a, t is b // 2 if b is even or (b // 2) + 1 if b is odd; otherwise, t is updated based on t2 % 15, either t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15 if t2 % 15 == 0 or t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1 if t2 % 15 != 0)**
