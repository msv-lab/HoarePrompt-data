Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer converted from its original string value, `b` is an integer (unchanged from its original integer value), `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `a` and `b` are now the integers parsed from the input string, `t1` and `t2` are updated as described. If `t` (which is initially equal to `b`) is even, `t` is updated to `b // 2`. If `t` is odd, `t` is updated to `b // 2 + 1`.***
