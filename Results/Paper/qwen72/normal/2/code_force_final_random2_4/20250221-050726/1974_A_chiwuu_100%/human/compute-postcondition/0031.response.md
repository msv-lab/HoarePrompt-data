Output State: **`a` is an integer (converted from its original string value), `b` is an integer (unchanged from its original integer value), `t` is either `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.**

Explanation:
- `a` remains an integer converted from its original string value.
- `b` remains an integer unchanged from its original value.
- `t` is updated based on the conditions: if `b` is even, `t` is set to `b // 2`; if `b` is odd, `t` is set to `(b // 2) + 1`.
- `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, using the updated value of `t`.
