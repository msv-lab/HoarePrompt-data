Output State: **`a` is an integer (converted from its original string value), `b` is an integer (unchanged from its original integer value), `t` is equal to `b // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to be the integer division of `b` by 2 (`b // 2`). The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
