Output State: **`a` is an integer (converted from its original string value), `b` is an integer (unchanged from its original integer value), `t` is `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`**

Explanation:
- `t` is updated to `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1`.
- `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4`, but since `t` has been updated, `t1` will also reflect this new value.
- `t2` remains `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`, but since `t` has been updated, `t2` will also reflect this new value.
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
