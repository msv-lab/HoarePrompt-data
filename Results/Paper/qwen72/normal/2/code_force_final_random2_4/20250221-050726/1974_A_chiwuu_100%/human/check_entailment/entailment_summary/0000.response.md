Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of screens required to fit a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Initial Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons (`t`)**:
   - The variable `t` is initially set to the number of 2x2 icons (`b`), and then adjusted based on whether `b` is even or odd. If `b` is even, `t` is set to `b // 2`, meaning each 2x2 icon takes up half a screen (since a screen can hold 2 such icons). If `b` is odd, `t` is set to `(b // 2) + 1`, meaning one additional screen is needed for the last 2x2 icon.

2. **Calculation of Remaining Space (`t1`)**:
   - The variable `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This represents the total number of 1x1 icon slots available after placing all 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns), and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so `t * 15` gives the total number of cells across `t` screens, and `b * 4` subtracts the cells occupied by 2x2 icons.

3. **Adjusting for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If `t1` (the remaining space) is greater than or equal to `a` (the number of 1x1 icons), no additional screens are needed, and `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, the program calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. The number of additional screens is the ceiling of `(a - t1) / 15`.

4. **Output**:
   - The final value of `t` (the total number of screens) is printed for each test case.

The logic appears to correctly handle the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons, ensuring that the minimum number of screens is used. The program's approach to calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons and then adjusting for 1x1 icons seems sound.

However, there is a potential issue in the initial calculation of `t` for 2x2 icons. The program sets `t` to `b // 2` if `b` is even and `b // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd. This is correct, but it could be simplified to `t = (b + 1) // 2`, which handles both even and odd cases in a single expression.

Despite this minor simplification, the overall logic and correctness of the program are maintained.

Correctness: **True**
