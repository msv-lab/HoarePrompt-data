Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer converted from its original string value, `b` is an integer (unchanged from its original integer value), `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `a` and `b` are now the integers parsed from the input string, `t1` is updated to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `b // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd, `t2` is `a - t1`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.***
