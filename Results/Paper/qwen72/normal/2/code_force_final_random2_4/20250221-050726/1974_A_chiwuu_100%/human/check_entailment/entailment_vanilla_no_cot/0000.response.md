Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for all cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons and then fitting the 1x1 icons into the remaining space is flawed.

Here are some issues:
1. The calculation `t = b` followed by `if t % 2 == 0: t = t // 2 else: t = t // 2 + 1` is incorrect. This logic is supposed to determine the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons, but it doesn't account for the fact that each screen can fit up to 3 such icons (since a screen is 5x3, and a 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells).

2. The calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is also incorrect. It assumes that each screen can fit exactly 15 1x1 icons, which is true, but it doesn't correctly handle the placement of 2x2 icons. A 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and a screen can fit up to 3 such icons, leaving 3 cells free for 1x1 icons.

3. The logic for handling the remaining 1x1 icons (`t2 = a - t1`) and adding additional screens (`if t2 % 15 == 0: t = t + t2 // 15 else: t = t + t2 // 15 + 1`) is also flawed because it doesn't consider the remaining space on the screens already used for 2x2 icons.

A correct approach would involve:
- First, calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons, considering that each screen can fit up to 3 such icons.
- Then, calculating the remaining space on these screens and fitting as many 1x1 icons as possible.
- Finally, calculating the number of additional screens needed for any remaining 1x1 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (b + 2) // 3
        
        # Calculate the remaining space on these screens for 1x1 icons
        remaining_space = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - b * 4
        
        # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining space
        a -= min(a, remaining_space)
        
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_1x1 = (a + 14) // 15
        
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
        
        print(total_screens)
```

This corrected version should handle all test cases correctly.
