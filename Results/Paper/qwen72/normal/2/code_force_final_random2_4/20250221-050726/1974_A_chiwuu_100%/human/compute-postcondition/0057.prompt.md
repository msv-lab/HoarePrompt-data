You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b
        
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        
        print(t)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `t` will hold the final computed value for each iteration, which is updated based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, `t` starts as `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd. If `t1` (calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`) is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains the same. Otherwise, `t` is adjusted based on the difference `t2` (calculated as `a - t1`). If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`. If `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1`. The variables `a` and `b` are updated with each iteration to the next pair of integers read from the input. The loop will have processed `n` pairs of integers (`a`, `b`), and the final state of `t` will reflect the last computation performed in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `x` and `y`, which are integers between 0 and 99, and `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000). The function returns a result or results based on the values of `x` and `y` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
