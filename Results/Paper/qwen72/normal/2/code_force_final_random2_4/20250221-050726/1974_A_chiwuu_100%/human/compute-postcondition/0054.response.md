To determine what will be printed by the `print(t)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a` is an integer converted from its original string value.
- `b` is an integer (unchanged from its original integer value).
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
- `a` and `b` are now the integers parsed from the input string.
- `t1` is updated to `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- `t` is either `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `b // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd.
- If `t1 >= a`, `t` remains the same.
- Otherwise, `t2` is `a - t1`.
- If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`.
- Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `t` based on `b`:**
   - If `b` is even, `t = b // 2`.
   - If `b` is odd, `t = b // 2 + 1`.

2. **Calculate `t1`:**
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.

3. **Check the condition `t1 >= a`:**
   - If `t1 >= a`, `t` remains the same.
   - If `t1 < a`, calculate `t2`:
     - `t2 = a - t1`.

4. **Update `t` based on `t2`:**
   - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t = t + t2 // 15`.
   - Otherwise, `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1`.

### Final Output:
The value of `t` after all these calculations will be printed. Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the process and the final value of `t` in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **t (where t is the final value after the described calculations based on the values of a and b)**
