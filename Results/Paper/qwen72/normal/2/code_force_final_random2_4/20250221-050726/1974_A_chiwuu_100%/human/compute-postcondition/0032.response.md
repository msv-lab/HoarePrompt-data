The line `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer (converted from its original string value), `b` is an integer (unchanged from its original integer value), `t` is either `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.**
