The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are integers within the range 0 to 99, inclusive. Additionally, there is a parameter `t` which represents the number of test cases, ranging from 1 to 10,000. The function's output is not specified in the prompt, so I cannot definitively state what the function returns without more information. However, based on common programming practices, it is reasonable to assume that the function might return some result or results based on the values of `x` and `y` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `x` and `y`, which are integers between 0 and 99, and `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000). The function returns a result or results based on the values of `x` and `y` for each test case.**
