Output State: **`s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `m` must be at least 1, `i` is the second character of `s`, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s`, `s2` is an empty string if the size of `alphabet` is not 1; otherwise, `s2` contains the first character of `s`. If `len(alphabet) != 1` and `i` is in `alphabet`, `alphabet` is updated to exclude `i`, the size of `alphabet` is now `k-2` if `k-1` was not 1. If `len(alphabet) != 1` and `i` is not in `alphabet`, the size of `alphabet` is `k-1` if it was not 1, otherwise it remains 1. If `len(alphabet) == 1`, `s2` is a string containing the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s`, and the size of `alphabet` is `k-1` if it was not 1, otherwise it remains 1.**
