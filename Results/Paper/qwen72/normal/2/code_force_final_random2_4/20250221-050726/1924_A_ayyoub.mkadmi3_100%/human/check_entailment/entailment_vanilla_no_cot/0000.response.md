Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided solution has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Check**: The function `func_1` attempts to track the subsequences by removing characters from the `alphabet` set and then checking the length of the resulting string. However, this approach does not correctly identify all possible subsequences of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It only checks if the string `s` contains at least `n * k` characters from the first `k` alphabets, which is not sufficient to ensure that all possible combinations of length `n` are present.

2. **Generating Missing Subsequence**: When the function determines that not all subsequences are present, it generates a missing subsequence by appending a character that is not in `s1`. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the generated subsequence is one of the missing ones. For example, if `s` is "abb" and `n = 2`, `k = 2`, the function might incorrectly generate "aa" as a missing subsequence even though "aa" is not a valid subsequence of "abb".

3. **Logic in `func_1`**: The logic inside `func_1` is overly complex and does not correctly handle the generation of subsequences. The use of `r = len(s1) // k` and the slicing `s1[r * k:]` does not make sense in the context of the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, a more appropriate approach would involve generating all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and then checking if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. If any of these strings is not a subsequence, it should be printed as the missing subsequence.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(s, sub):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in sub)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    
    # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k alphabets
    possible_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
    
    # Check if all possible strings are subsequences of s
    found_all = True
    missing_string = None
    for ps in possible_strings:
        if not is_subsequence(s, ps):
            found_all = False
            missing_string = ps
            break
    
    if found_all:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
        print(missing_string)
```

This corrected version uses the `itertools.product` function to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and then checks if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. If any string is not a subsequence, it is printed as the missing subsequence.
