Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `m` must be at least 1, `i` is the first character of `s`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`, and `s2` is an empty string if the size of `alphabet` is not 1; otherwise, `s2` contains the first character of `s`. The size of `alphabet` is `k-1` if it was not 1, otherwise it remains 1. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, no changes are made to `s1`, `s2`, or `alphabet`.***
