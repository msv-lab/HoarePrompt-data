### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
   - It initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings and creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and checks if each character is in the `alphabet` set.
   - If a character is found in the `alphabet` set, it is added to `s1`. If the `alphabet` set has more than one element, the character is removed from the set. If the `alphabet` set has only one element, the character is added to `s2` and the `alphabet` set is reset to contain all `k` alphabets.
   - After processing the string, it calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic checks the result of `func_1`:
     - If `b` (the first element of the tuple returned by `func_1`) is `False`, it means not all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
     - In this case, it appends "No" to the output list `OUT` and constructs a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s` by finding the first character not in `s1` and repeating it to form the required string.
     - If `b` is `True`, it appends "Yes" to the output list `OUT`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints each element of the output list `OUT`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Subsequence Check**: The function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. It only checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, which is not sufficient to ensure that all possible combinations of length `n` are subsequences.
- **Subsequence Construction**: The construction of the missing subsequence in the "No" case is not guaranteed to be correct. The program simply repeats a character not in `s1`, but this does not ensure that the constructed string is indeed a missing subsequence.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for checking subsequences and constructing missing subsequences is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
