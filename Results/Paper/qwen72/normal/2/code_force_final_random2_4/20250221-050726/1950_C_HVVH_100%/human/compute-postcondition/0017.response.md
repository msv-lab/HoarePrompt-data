Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer representing the minute part of the input time. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` remains 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is reduced by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is less than or equal to 12, `h` remains unchanged, and `day` is set to 'PM' if `h` is 12, otherwise `day` remains 'AM'.***
