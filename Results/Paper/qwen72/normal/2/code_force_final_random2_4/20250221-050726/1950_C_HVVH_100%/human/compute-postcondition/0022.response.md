Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` must be greater than 1 (since it was decremented by 1), `h` is 12, `m` is the integer value of the minute part of the new input, `day` is 'AM'.** 

The code sets `day` to 'AM', which updates the value of `day`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
