Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `m` is the integer value of the minute part of the new input.
- `h` is the integer value of the hour part of the new input.
- If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'.
- If `h` > 12, `h` is reduced by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'.
- If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'.
- Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `h` and `m`**:
   - `h` and `m` are derived from the input time `s` in the format "hh:mm".
   - `h` is the hour part, and `m` is the minute part.

2. **Adjust `h` and Set `day`**:
   - If `h` is 0, set `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
   - If `h` > 12, reduce `h` by 12 and set `day` to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, set `day` to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.

3. **Format the Output**:
   - The print statement formats the hour and minute parts with leading zeros if necessary.
   - It then appends the `day` value.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `s` is "14:30":
- `h` = 14
- `m` = 30

Since `h` > 12:
- `h` = 14 - 12 = 2
- `day` = 'PM'

The print statement will output:
```python
print(f'{2:02d}:{30:02d}', 'PM')
```

### Final Output:
Output: **02:30 PM**

This format ensures that the hour and minute are always displayed with two digits, and the correct AM/PM designation is appended based on the initial conditions.
