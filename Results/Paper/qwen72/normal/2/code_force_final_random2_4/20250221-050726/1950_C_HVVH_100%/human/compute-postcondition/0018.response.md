Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `m` is an integer representing the minute part of the input time.
- `h` is the hour part of the input time.
- If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` remains 'AM'.
- If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is reduced by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'.
- If `h` is less than or equal to 12, `h` remains unchanged, and `day` is set to 'PM' if `h` is 12, otherwise `day` remains 'AM'.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Extracting `h` and `m` from `s`:**
   - `s` is in the format "hh:mm".
   - `h` is the hour part (first two characters).
   - `m` is the minute part (last two characters).

2. **Adjusting `h` and `day` based on the rules:**
   - If `h` is 0, set `h` to 12 and keep `day` as 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, reduce `h` by 12 and set `day` to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is less than or equal to 12, keep `h` unchanged and set `day` to 'PM' if `h` is 12, otherwise keep `day` as 'AM'.

3. **Formatting the output:**
   - The print statement formats `h` and `m` to ensure they are always two digits (e.g., 01, 09).
   - It then prints the formatted time followed by the value of `day`.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `s` is "15:30".
  - `h` = 15
  - `m` = 30
  - Since `h` is greater than 12, `h` is reduced by 12 to 3, and `day` is set to 'PM'.
  - The output will be "03:30 PM".

- Suppose `s` is "09:45".
  - `h` = 9
  - `m` = 45
  - Since `h` is less than or equal to 12, `h` remains 9, and `day` remains 'AM'.
  - The output will be "09:45 AM".

- Suppose `s` is "00:15".
  - `h` = 0
  - `m` = 15
  - Since `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12, and `day` remains 'AM'.
  - The output will be "12:15 AM".

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the rules provided, the print statement will output the time in 12-hour format with the appropriate AM/PM indicator.

Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day} (where h is the adjusted hour part of the input time, m is the minute part of the input time, and day is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the rules described)**
