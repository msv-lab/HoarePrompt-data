Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a time in the format "hh:mm" and splits it into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).

2. **Time Conversion Logic**:
   - The logic for converting the 24-hour format to 12-hour format is as follows:
     - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and the period to 'AM'. This is correct because 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.
     - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets the period to 'PM'. This is correct because 13:00 in 24-hour format is 01:00 PM in 12-hour format.
     - If `h` is exactly 12, it sets the period to 'PM'. This is correct because 12:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 PM in 12-hour format.
     - Otherwise, it sets the period to 'AM'. This is correct because any hour from 1 to 11 in 24-hour format remains the same in 12-hour format with the period set to 'AM'.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the converted time in the format "hh:mm AM/PM" using formatted string literals (`f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'`). This ensures that the hours and minutes are always displayed with leading zeros when necessary.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as "00:00" (which should be "12:00 AM") and "12:00" (which should be "12:00 PM").
   - It also correctly handles times like "23:59" (which should be "11:59 PM").

5. **General Correctness**:
   - The logic for converting hours and determining the period (AM/PM) is correct.
   - The formatting of the output ensures that the hours and minutes are always displayed with leading zeros when necessary.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly convert 24-hour format times to 12-hour format times as specified in the problem description.

Final: **True**
