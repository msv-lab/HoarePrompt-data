Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format according to the specifications given in the problem description. It handles all edge cases, such as converting `00:00` to `12:00 AM`, `12:00` to `12:00 PM`, and other times appropriately. The logic for determining whether the time is `AM` or `PM` is also implemented correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
