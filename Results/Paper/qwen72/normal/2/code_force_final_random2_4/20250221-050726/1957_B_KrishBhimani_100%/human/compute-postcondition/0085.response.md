Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the new input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`, `_` is incremented by 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is 4. Otherwise, `i` is 0, `temp` is 2, and `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
