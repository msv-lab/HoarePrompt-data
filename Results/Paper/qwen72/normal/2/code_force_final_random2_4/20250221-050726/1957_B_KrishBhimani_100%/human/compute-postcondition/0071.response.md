To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `l1` is a list of strings from the new input.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`.
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - If `n` is 1:
     - `arr` is an empty list.
     - `k0` is equal to `k`.
     - `ans` remains unchanged.
   - If `n` is not 1:
     - `arr` is an empty list.
     - `k0` is equal to `k`.
     - `ans` is a list containing the values \([2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]\) followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the highest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`.
     - `temp` is \(2^i\).

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(k)` will print the value of `k`.

Given the initial state, the value of `k` is determined by the second element of the list `l1`. The conditions provided do not modify the value of `k` directly; they only set other variables based on the value of `n`.

Therefore, the value of `k` remains the same as it was initially set from the second element of `l1`.

Output: **k (where k is the integer value of the second element of the new l1)**
