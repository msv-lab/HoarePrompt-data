Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the number of non-negative integers to be printed and their sum, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l1 = input().split()
    n, k = list(map(int, l1))
    if n == 1:
        print(k)
    else:
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        ans = []
        temp = 1
        while True:
            if temp * 2 < k:
                temp *= 2
                i += 1
            else:
                break
        ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
        ans.append(k - sum(ans))
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`. If `n` is equal to 1, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, or `k`. If `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, and `ans` is a list containing the values `[2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]` followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the highest integer such that `2^i` is less than `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `_` is incremented by 1. If `n` is 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values \([2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]\) followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the highest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`. Additionally, `temp` is \(2^i\) when `n` is not 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the new input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`, `_` is incremented by 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`. If `n` is 1, `ans` remains unchanged. If `n` is not 1, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the initial values \((2^i - 1)\) and \((k - (2^i - 1))\) followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`, and `temp` is \(2^i\).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
