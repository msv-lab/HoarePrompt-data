The code snippet `temp *= 2` multiplies the current value of `temp` by 2. Based on the initial state, we know that if `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is 4. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and `temp` is 1, and `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Let's analyze the two cases:

1. **If `temp * 2` is less than `k`:**
   - Initially, `temp` is 4.
   - After executing `temp *= 2`, `temp` becomes `4 * 2 = 8`.
   - Since `temp * 2` (which is now 8) is still less than `k`, the condition `temp * 2 < k` remains true.

2. **If `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`:**
   - Initially, `temp` is 1.
   - After executing `temp *= 2`, `temp` becomes `1 * 2 = 2`.
   - Since `temp * 2` (which is now 2) is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition `temp * 2 >= k` remains true.

Given these conditions, the output state will depend on the initial value of `temp`:

- If `temp` was 4 (and `temp * 2` was less than `k`), then `temp` becomes 8.
- If `temp` was 1 (and `temp * 2` was greater than or equal to `k`), then `temp` becomes 2.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 1 if `temp` was 4 and `temp * 2` is less than `k`, otherwise `i` is 0, `temp` is 8 if `temp` was 4, otherwise `temp` is 2.**
