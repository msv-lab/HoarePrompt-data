The code appends the value `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Let's break down the impact:

- `ans` initially contains the value `2^i - 1`, where `i` is the highest integer such that `2^i` is less than `k`.
- `sum(ans)` is the sum of the elements in `ans`, which is currently just `2^i - 1`.
- The new value being appended to `ans` is `k - (2^i - 1)`.
- After appending, `ans` will contain two elements: `2^i - 1` and `k - (2^i - 1)`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]`, where `i` is the highest integer such that `2^i` is less than `k`.**
