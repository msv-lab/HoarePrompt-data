You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `_` has been incremented by the number of test cases processed. For each test case, `n` and `k` are the integer values of the first and second elements of `l1`, respectively. If `n` is 1, the output for that test case is `k`, and `arr` remains an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `n` is not 1, the output for that test case is a list of length `n` containing the values \((2^i - 1)\) and \((k - (2^i - 1))\) followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`. The variable `temp` is \(2^i\) for each test case where `n` is not 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` as input, where `n` represents the number of non-negative integers to be printed and `k` represents their sum. If `n` is 1, the function prints `k`. Otherwise, it constructs a list of `n` non-negative integers such that the first element is the largest power of 2 less than `k` minus 1, the second element is the remaining value needed to reach `k`, and the rest of the elements are zeros. The function prints this list for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This is correctly handled using a loop.

2. **Single Element Case**: If `n` is 1, the function directly prints `k`. This is correct because the only way to satisfy the condition with a single element is to use `k` itself.

3. **Multiple Elements Case**:
   - The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the sequence.
   - It then finds the largest power of 2 less than `k` and appends `(1 << i) - 1` to `ans`, where `i` is the exponent of the largest power of 2. This ensures that the number of 1s in the binary representation is maximized.
   - It appends the remaining value `k - sum(ans)` to `ans` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.
   - Finally, it pads the list with zeros to ensure the length of the list is `n`.

4. **Binary Representation Maximization**:
   - The choice of `(1 << i) - 1` ensures that the number of 1s in the binary representation is maximized. For example, if `k` is 10, the largest power of 2 less than 10 is 8, so `(1 << 3) - 1` is 7, which is `111` in binary.
   - The remaining value is added to ensure the sum is `k`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - For `n > 1`, it ensures that the sequence is constructed such that the sum is `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
