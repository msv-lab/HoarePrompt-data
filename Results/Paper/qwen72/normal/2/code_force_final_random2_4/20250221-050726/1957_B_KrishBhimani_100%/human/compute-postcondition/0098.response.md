To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `ans` list step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `l1` is a list of strings from the new input.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`.
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `arr` is an empty list.
   - `k0` is equal to `k`.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the initial values \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\) followed by `n - 2` zeros.
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`.
   - `temp` is \(2^i\).

2. **Constructing the `ans` List:**
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\). This means \(i\) is the largest integer where \(2^i\) is less than `k`.
   - `temp` is \(2^i\).
   - The first element of `ans` is \((1 << i) - 1\), which is equivalent to \(2^i - 1\).
   - The second element of `ans` is \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), which simplifies to \(k - (2^i - 1)\).
   - The remaining `n - 2` elements of `ans` are zeros.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `k = 10` and `n = 5`.
   - The largest integer \(i\) such that \(2^i < 10\) is 3 (since \(2^3 = 8\) and \(2^4 = 16\)).
   - Therefore, \(temp = 2^3 = 8\).
   - The first element of `ans` is \((1 << 3) - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7\).
   - The second element of `ans` is \(10 - 7 = 3\).
   - The remaining elements are zeros.
   - Thus, `ans` will be `[7, 3, 0, 0, 0]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

Given the above steps, the output will be:

Output: **7 3 0 0 0 (where the values depend on the specific values of `n` and `k`)**

This format ensures that the output is clear and understandable, providing the precise values based on the initial state and the construction of the `ans` list.
