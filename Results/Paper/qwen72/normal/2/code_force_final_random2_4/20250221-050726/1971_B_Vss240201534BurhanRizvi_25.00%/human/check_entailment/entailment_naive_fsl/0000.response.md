Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program uses `random.sample` to shuffle the string `s`. While this approach can generate a different string `s2` that is not equal to `s`, it does not guarantee that `s2` will always be different from `s`. There is a possibility, especially for shorter strings, that `s2` could end up being the same as `s` due to the randomness. In such a case, the program would incorrectly print "No" even though a valid rearrangement might exist. For example, consider the input "ab":

- If `random.sample` happens to return "ab" again, the program will print "No", which is incorrect because "ba" is a valid rearrangement.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of always finding a valid rearrangement if one exists.
