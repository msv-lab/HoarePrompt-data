The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. The state of `t` and `s` do not directly affect the loop's execution, but they are part of the initial state.

To ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer. Therefore, the state should reflect that the input is a positive integer, and the loop counter `_` is initialized to 0 (as it is the first iteration).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, the input is a positive integer, `_` is 0**
