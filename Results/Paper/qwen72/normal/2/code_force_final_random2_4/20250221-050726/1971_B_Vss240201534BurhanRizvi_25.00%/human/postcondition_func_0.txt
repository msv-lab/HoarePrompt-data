The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. It then generates a random shuffle `s2` of the string `s`. If `s2` is different from `s`, it prints "Yes" followed by the shuffled string `s2`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints "No". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state includes `t` being the original input integer, `s` being the last input string, and `_` being `t-1`.
