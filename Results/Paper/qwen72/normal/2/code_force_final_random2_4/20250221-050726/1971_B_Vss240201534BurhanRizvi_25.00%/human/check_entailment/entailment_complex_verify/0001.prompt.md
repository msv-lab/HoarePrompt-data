You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is the last input string (a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters), `_` is `t-1`, and `s2` is a shuffled version of the last input string `s`. If the last `s` is not equal to `s2`, the condition `s != s2` holds true. If the last `s` is equal to `s2`, the condition `s == s2` holds true.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. It then generates a random shuffle `s2` of the string `s`. If `s2` is different from `s`, it prints "Yes" followed by the shuffled string `s2`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints "No". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state includes `t` being the original input integer, `s` being the last input string, and `_` being `t-1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case, reading the string `s` for each case.

2. **String Rearrangement**: The program uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to generate a random permutation of the string `s`. This function returns a new list containing all elements from `s` in a random order, which is then joined back into a string `s2`.

3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - If `s2` is different from `s`, the program prints "Yes" followed by `s2`.
   - If `s2` is the same as `s`, the program prints "No".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For strings with all identical characters (e.g., "aaaaa"), the program will always print "No" because any permutation of such a string will be the same as the original.
   - For strings with at least two different characters, the program has a high probability of generating a different permutation, but it is not guaranteed to always find one due to the randomness.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program meets the requirements of the problem statement. It correctly handles the edge cases where all characters are the same and outputs "No".
   - For other cases, it attempts to generate a different permutation and outputs "Yes" if successful.

However, there is a minor issue with the output format. The problem statement specifies that "YES" and "NO" should be outputted in any case (e.g., "yEs", "yes", "Yes"). The program currently outputs "Yes" and "No" in a specific case, which might not be strictly necessary but is generally acceptable.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in terms of logic and functionality, but it could be improved to handle the case-insensitive output of "YES" and "NO" more explicitly.

Correctness: **True**
