Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is the last input string (a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters), `_` is `t-1`, and `s2` is a shuffled version of the last input string `s`. If the last `s` is not equal to `s2`, the condition `s != s2` holds true. If the last `s` is equal to `s2`, the condition `s == s2` holds true.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, indicating the total number of iterations the loop was supposed to run.
- The variable `s` contains the last input string provided during the final iteration of the loop, which is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The loop counter `_` has reached the value `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `s2` contains a shuffled version of the last input string `s`.
- Depending on whether the last `s` is equal to `s2`, either the condition `s != s2` or `s == s2` will hold true, and the corresponding output ("Yes" or "No") along with the shuffled string (if applicable) will have been printed for each iteration.
