Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is the input string (a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters), the input is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, and `s2` is a shuffled version of the string `s`. If `s` is not equal to `s2`, the condition `s != s2` holds true. If `s` is equal to `s2`, the condition `s == s2` holds true.*** 

Note: Since the if and else parts do not change the state of the variables, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
