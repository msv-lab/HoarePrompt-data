The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. The function returns a value based on these parameters.

Since the specific output conditions are not provided, I will describe the general functionality based on the given parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer between 1 and 1000, and `s`, a string of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. The function returns a value based on these parameters.**
