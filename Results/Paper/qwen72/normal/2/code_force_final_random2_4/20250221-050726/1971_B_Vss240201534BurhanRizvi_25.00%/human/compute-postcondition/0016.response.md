The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop's continuation is determined by the value of `_` relative to the input integer.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and the input is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to increment by 1, making it 2, and the input must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

Since the input is not changed within the loop, its value remains the same. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to increment `_` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is the input string (a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters), the input is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, and `s2` is a shuffled version of the string `s`. If `s` is not equal to `s2`, the condition `s != s2` holds true. If `s` is equal to `s2`, the condition `s == s2` holds true.**
