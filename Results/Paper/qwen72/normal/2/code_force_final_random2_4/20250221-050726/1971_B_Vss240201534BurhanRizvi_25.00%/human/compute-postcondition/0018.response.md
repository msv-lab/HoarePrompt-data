The code snippet shuffles the characters of the string `s` and assigns the result to `s2`. The length of `s2` remains the same as `s`, and `s2` is now a shuffled version of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is the new input string (a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters), `_` is 2, `s2` is a shuffled version of the original string `s`. If the new `s` is not equal to `s2`, the condition `s != s2` holds true. If the new `s` is equal to `s2`, the condition `s == s2` holds true.**
