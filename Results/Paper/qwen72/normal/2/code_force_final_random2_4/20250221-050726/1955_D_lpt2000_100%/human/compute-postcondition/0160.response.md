Output State: **The value of `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. All other variables (`nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `D`, `pairs_in_D`, `C`, `fnd`, `in_aa`) remain unchanged.** 

This means that the dictionary `E` has its value at the key `out_aa` reduced by 1, while all other variables and their values remain the same as they were before the execution of the code snippet.
