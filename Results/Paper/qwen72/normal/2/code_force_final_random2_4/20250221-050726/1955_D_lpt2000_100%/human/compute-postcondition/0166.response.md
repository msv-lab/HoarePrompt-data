Postcondition: **`in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` before the code execution, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. If `D[out_aa] <= 0`, then `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `D`, `E`, `C`) retain their previous values.**
