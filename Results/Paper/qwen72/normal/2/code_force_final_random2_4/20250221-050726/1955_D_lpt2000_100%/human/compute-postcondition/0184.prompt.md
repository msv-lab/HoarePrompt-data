Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, representing the lengths of arrays a and b, and the required number of matching elements, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. `nabors` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                pairs_in_D -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            D[in_aa] += 1
            pairs_in_D += 1
            C[in_aa] -= 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `fnd` will be the total number of times `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution. The values of `D`, `E`, and `C` will reflect the final state of the counters after processing all elements in `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]`. Specifically, `D` will contain the intersection of the updated `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` will contain the elements in the updated `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, and `C` will contain the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`. The value of `pairs_in_D` will be the sum of the values in `D` after the final iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, the final state will be as follows:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, the value of `fnd` will be the total count of iterations where `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k`. The values of `D`, `E`, and `C` will reflect the final frequencies of elements after processing all the elements in `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]`. The values of `in_aa` and `out_aa` will be the last elements processed in the loop. The values of `nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, and `cnt_bb` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
