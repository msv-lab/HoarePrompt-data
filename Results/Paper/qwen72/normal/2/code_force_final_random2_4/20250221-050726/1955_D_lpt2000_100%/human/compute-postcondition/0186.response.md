Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates the number of times a sliding window of size `m` in list `a` contains at least `k` elements that are also present in list `b`. The function prints the total count of such occurrences for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ends without returning any value. The final state includes the printed results for each test case, and the internal variables used for computation are reset for each new test case. **
