Output State: **`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` before the code execution, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, all other variables (`nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `D`, `E`, `C`, `pairs_in_D`) retain their previous values.**
