Output State: **`D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` before the execution, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged, `in_aa` and `out_aa` are the next elements in `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` respectively, and both `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` must have at least one more element each. `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` > 0, the value of `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the value of `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1.** 

Explanation: The code `C[in_aa] -= 1` decrements the value of `C[in_aa]` by 1. All other conditions and variable states remain as described in the initial state.
