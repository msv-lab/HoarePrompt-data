The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `a`. If there are more characters in `a`, the loop will execute again with the next character.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, and `j` is the first character of `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 2 characters, and `j` will be the second character of `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `j` is the second character of `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 1.**
