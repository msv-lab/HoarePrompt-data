The value of `h` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `h` depends on the value of `j`. If `j` is 'A', then `h` was initially 0, and now it becomes 1. If `j` is not 'A', then `h` was initially 2, and now it becomes 3. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `l` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `j` is the third character of `a`, if `j` is 'A' then `l` is 2 and `h` is 1, otherwise `l` is 0 and `h` is 3.**
