Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string, and then prints the character that appears more frequently. The program handles the constraints and input format as specified in the problem description. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing each test case and printing the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
