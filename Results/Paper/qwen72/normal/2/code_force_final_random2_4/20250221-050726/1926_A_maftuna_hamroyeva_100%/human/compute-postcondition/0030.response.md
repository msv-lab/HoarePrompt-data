Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, `l` is 0, `h` is 0, and if `l` > `h`, the number of 'A' characters (`l`) is not greater than the number of non-'A' characters (`h`). Otherwise, `l` is less than or equal to `h`. The current character being evaluated, `j`, is 'A'.**
