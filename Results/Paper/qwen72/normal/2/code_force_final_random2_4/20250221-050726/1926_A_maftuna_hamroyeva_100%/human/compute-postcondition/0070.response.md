Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 32, `i` is 2, `a` is the input string, `l` is the number of 'A' characters in the string `a`, and `h` is the number of non-'A' characters in the string `a`. Additionally, the number of 'A' characters (`l`) is less than or equal to the number of non-'A' characters (`h`).***
