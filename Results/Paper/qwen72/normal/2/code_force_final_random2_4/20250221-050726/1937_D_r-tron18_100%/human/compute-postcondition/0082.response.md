Output State: **`el` is the third-to-last character of `s1`, `i` is `n - 3`, `suffZero` has a new element which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 2`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, `ans[i]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) - 2 * preOne[-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`.
- `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`.
- `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1]`.
- The value of `ans[i]` is therefore `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) - 2 * preOne[-1]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
