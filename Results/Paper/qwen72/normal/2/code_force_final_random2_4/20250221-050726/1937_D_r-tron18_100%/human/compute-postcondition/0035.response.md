Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1`. If `el` is '>', `totalOne` is decremented by 1, the last element of `pre` is removed, and the last element of `preOne` is removed. If `totalOne` (now `ol`) is less than or equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1 (which is 0), `ans[n-1]` is set to `-(2 * preOne[-1] - preOne[0])`. Otherwise, `ans[n-1]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, where `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - preOne[0]` if `preOne` still has elements, otherwise `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0)`, and `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`. If `el` is not '>', `suffZero` is updated to [0, n]. If `zr` (which is `len(suffZero) - 1`) is less than or equal to `ol` (which is `totalOne`), `ans[n-1]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, where `zeroInd` is `n` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. If `zr` is greater than `ol`, `ans[n-1]` is set to `2 * n - 2 * preOne[-1]`.***
