The value of `totalOne` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, but with the last element removed, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1` and `el` is '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1 (which is 0), if `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, `ans[n-1]` is `-(2 * preOne[-1] - preOne[0])`, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - preOne[0]` (if `preOne` still has elements), otherwise, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[n-1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.**
