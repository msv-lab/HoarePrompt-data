The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `times` (where `0 <= times <= len(arr)`). It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. This ensures that the index does not go out of bounds. The function does not modify the input list `arr`.
