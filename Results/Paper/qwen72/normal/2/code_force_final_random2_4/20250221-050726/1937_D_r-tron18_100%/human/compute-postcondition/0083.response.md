Postcondition: ***`el` is the third-to-last character of `s1`, `i` is `n - 3`, `suffZero` has a new element which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 2`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[n - 3]` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2] - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1`. Otherwise, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `ans[i]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) - 2 * preOne[-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
