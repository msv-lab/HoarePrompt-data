Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5. `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`. `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, but the last element of `preOne` has been removed. `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0. `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0. `i` is `n - 2`. `el` is the second-to-last character of `s1`. `ol` is `totalOne`. `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, then `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `ans[n-2]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`. Otherwise, `ans[n-2]` is `- func_1(preOne, zr + 1) + func_1(preOne, 1) + n + 1`, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.**
