Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1`. If `el` is '>', `totalOne` is decremented by 1, the last element of `pre` is removed, and the last element of `preOne` is removed. If `totalOne` (now `ol`) is less than or equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1 (which is 0), `ans[n-1]` is set to `-(2 * preOne[-1] - preOne[0])`. Otherwise, `ans[n-1]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, where `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - preOne[0]` if `preOne` still has elements, otherwise `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0)`, and `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`. If `el` is not '>', `suffZero` is updated to [0, n]. If `zr` (which is `len(suffZero) - 1`) is less than or equal to `ol` (which is `totalOne`), `ans[n-1]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, where `zeroInd` is `n` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. If `zr` is greater than `ol`, `ans[n-1]` is set to `2 * n - 2 * preOne[-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5. `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`. `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0. `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0. `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0. `i` is `n - 2`. `el` is the second-to-last character of `s1`. If `el` is '>', `totalOne` is decremented by 1, the last element of `preOne` is removed, and `ans[n-2]` is updated based on the comparison between `ol` (which is `totalOne`) and `zr` (which is `len(suffZero) - 1`). If `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, `ans[n-2]` is set to `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`. Otherwise, `ans[n-2]` is set to `- func_1(preOne, zr + 1) + func_1(preOne, 1) + n + 1`. If `el` is not '>', `suffZero` is updated to include `i + 1`, and `ans[i]` is updated based on the comparison between `zr` (which is `len(suffZero) - 1`) and `ol` (which is `totalOne`). If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd`. All other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`el` is the third-to-last character of `s1`, `i` is `n - 3`. If `el` is '>', `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` has one fewer element. If `ol` ≤ `zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne - 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `ans[i]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne - 1) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`. Otherwise, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1) + func_1(preOne, len(suffZero)) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, len(suffZero)) - func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`, and `ans[n - 3]` is `2 * suffZero[-1] - 2 * func_1(preOne, len(suffZero)) + func_1(preOne, 1) + n + 1`. If `el` is not '>', `suffZero` has a new element which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 2`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `zr` ≤ `ol`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[n - 3]` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2] - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1`. Otherwise, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `ans[i]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) - 2 * preOne[-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
