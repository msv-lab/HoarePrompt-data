Output State: **`el` is the third-to-last character of `s1`, `i` is `n - 3`, `suffZero` has a new element which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 2`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. The function `func_1` is called with arguments `preOne` and `zr`, and its result is multiplied by 2.
- All other variables (`el`, `i`, `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
