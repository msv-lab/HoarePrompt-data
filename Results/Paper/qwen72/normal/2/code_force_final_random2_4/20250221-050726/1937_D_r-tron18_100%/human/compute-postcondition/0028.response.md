To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables Involved:**
   - `preOne`: A list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0.
   - `zr`: The value of `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.
   - `oneInd`: This variable will store the result of the expression `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.

2. **Function Call:**
   - `func_1(preOne, zr)`: This function is called with `preOne` and `zr` as arguments. The exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, but we assume it returns a value based on the inputs.

3. **Calculate the Result:**
   - The result of `func_1(preOne, zr)` is multiplied by 2 and stored in `oneInd`.

### Impact on the Program:
- The value of `oneInd` is updated to `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` is a list with elements [0, n].
- `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `el` is the last character of `s1`, and `el` is not '>'.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`.
- `zeroInd` is `n`.
- `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with elements [0, n], `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1` and `el` is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1` and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `zeroInd` is `n`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.**
