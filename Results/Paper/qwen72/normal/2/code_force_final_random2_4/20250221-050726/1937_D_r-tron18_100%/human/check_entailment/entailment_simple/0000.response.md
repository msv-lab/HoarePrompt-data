### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a grid of length `n` with each cell containing either `<` or `>`.
   - A pinball placed on a cell moves left or right based on the direction of the cell, and the direction of the cell is flipped after the pinball moves.
   - We need to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid length `n` and the grid string `s1`.
   - It then calls `func_2(s1, n)` to compute the results.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(arr, times)`**:
     - This function calculates the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at a specific position determined by `times`.
     - It ensures the index does not go out of bounds using `max(-n, -1 - times)`.

   - **`func_2(s1, n)`**:
     - It initializes `pre` with the 1-based indices of all `>` characters in `s1`.
     - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of `pre` with an initial value of 0.
     - `suffZero` is initialized to `[0]` and will store the cumulative sums of the 1-based indices of all `<` characters in `s1`.
     - `ans` is initialized to a list of zeros of length `n`.

4. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates from the last character to the first character of `s1`.
   - For each character `el`:
     - If `el` is `>`, it calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid using `func_1` and updates `preOne` and `totalOne`.
     - If `el` is `<`, it updates `suffZero` and calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid using `func_1`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all characters, the results are printed.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly handles the input and output format.
- The logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is implemented correctly.
- The use of cumulative sums (`preOne` and `suffZero`) and the `func_1` function ensures efficient computation of the required times.
- The program correctly handles the edge cases and ensures that the pinball always leaves the grid within a finite number of steps.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
