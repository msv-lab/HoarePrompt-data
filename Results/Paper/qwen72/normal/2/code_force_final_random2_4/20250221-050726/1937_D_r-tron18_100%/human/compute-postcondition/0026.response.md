Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with elements [0, n], `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1`, and `el` is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`.**
