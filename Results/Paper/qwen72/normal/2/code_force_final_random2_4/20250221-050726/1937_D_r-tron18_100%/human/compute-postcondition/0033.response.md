The code snippet updates the value of `ans[i]` using the formula `zeroInd - oneInd`. Let's break down the impact:

- `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`.
- `i` is `n - 1`, so `ans[n - 1]` is updated.
- `zeroInd` is `2 * n`.
- `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.

Therefore, `ans[n - 1]` is set to `2 * n - 2 * preOne[-1]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with elements [0, n], `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 except `ans[n - 1]` which is set to `2 * n - 2 * preOne[-1]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1`, and `el` is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zr` is greater than `ol`, `zeroInd` is `2 * n`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.**
