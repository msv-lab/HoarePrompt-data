The value of `h` is updated by adding the current value of `curr` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `h` was initially `n // (n - k + 1)`.
- `curr` is `n`.

So, the new value of `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n`.

The rest of the variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `i`, `curr`) retain their original values.

Output State: **`n` is updated to `n - (n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n`, `i` is `1`, `curr` is `n`.**
