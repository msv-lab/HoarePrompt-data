### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the function `func_1` step by step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice has `n` coins.
- Bob wants Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
- Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with prices between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
- Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next until she runs out of coins or buys `k` jewels.

#### Function Summary:
- `func_1(n, k)`:
  - If `n == k`, it prints "YES" followed by 1 and 1.
  - If `n < k`, it prints "NO".
  - Otherwise, it calculates a series of values and prints either "NO" or "2", "YES", and the values `-k + 1` and `1`.

#### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Case 1: `n == k`**
   - The function correctly prints "YES" followed by 1 and 1.
   - This is correct because if Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel.

2. **Case 2: `n < k`**
   - The function correctly prints "NO".
   - This is correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

3. **Case 3: `n > k`**
   - The function calculates `costs = [n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - It then iterates over these costs, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall.
   - If the total number of jewels bought (`h`) is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "2", "YES", and the costs.

#### Issues with the Code:
- **Incorrect Handling of Stalls and Prices:**
  - The function always sets up 2 stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
  - This approach does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
  - For example, in the test case `n = 7, k = 3`:
    - The function sets up stalls with prices `[7 - 3 + 1, 1] = [5, 1]`.
    - Alice buys 1 jewel from the first stall (spending 5 coins) and 1 jewel from the second stall (spending 1 coin), leaving her with 1 coin and only 2 jewels in total.
    - This does not meet the requirement of buying exactly 3 jewels.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, specifically failing to set up the stalls and prices in a way that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
