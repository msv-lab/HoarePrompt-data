The code snippet `n -= i * curr` modifies the value of `n`. Let's break down the impact:

- `i` is `n - k + 1`.
- `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`.
- `n -= i * curr` means `n` is updated by subtracting `i * curr` from its current value.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k.
- `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is `n // (n - k + 1)`.
- `i` is `n - k + 1`.
- `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`.

Let's calculate the new value of `n`:
- `i * curr` is `(n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`.
- Since `n // (n - k + 1)` is the integer division of `n` by `n - k + 1`, let's denote this as `q`.
- Therefore, `i * curr` is `(n - k + 1) * q`.

Subtracting this from `n`:
- `n -= (n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`.

Since `n // (n - k + 1)` is the quotient when `n` is divided by `n - k + 1`, the expression simplifies to:
- `n -= (n - k + 1) * q`.

This effectively reduces `n` by a multiple of `n - k + 1`.

Thus, the new value of `n` is:
- `n = n - (n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is updated to `n - (n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // (n - k + 1)`, `i` is `n - k + 1`, `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`.**
