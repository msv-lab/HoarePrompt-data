The value of `h` is incremented by the value of `curr`. The value of `curr` is calculated as `n // (n - k + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k; `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // (n - k + 1)`, `i` is `n - k + 1`, `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`**.
