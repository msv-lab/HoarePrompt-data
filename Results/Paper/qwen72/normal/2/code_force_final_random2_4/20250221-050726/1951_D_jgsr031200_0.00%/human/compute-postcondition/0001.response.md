The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraint 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and it also states that the current values of `n` and `k` are equal. 

The code snippet contains a `print` statement that simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`, it will always print the same string regardless of their values.

Output: **YES**
