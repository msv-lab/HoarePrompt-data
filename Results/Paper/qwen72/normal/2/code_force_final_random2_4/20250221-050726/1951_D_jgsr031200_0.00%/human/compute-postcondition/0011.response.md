Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k; `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `h` to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, and the list `costs` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions for `n`, `k`, and `costs`, along with the new value of `h`.
