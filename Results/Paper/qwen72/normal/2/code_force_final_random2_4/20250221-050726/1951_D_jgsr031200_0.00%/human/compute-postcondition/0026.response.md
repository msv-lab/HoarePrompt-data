Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is `0`.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- `n` is less than `k`.
- `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n + 0`.
- `i` is `1`.
- `curr` is `0`.
- `h` is less than `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `n`:**
   - `n` is explicitly given as `0`.

2. **Value of `k`:**
   - `k` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).

3. **Value of `costs`:**
   - `costs` is defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - Substituting `n = 0`, we get `costs = [0 - k + 1, 1] = [-k + 1, 1]`.

4. **Value of `h`:**
   - `h` is defined as `n // (n - k + 1) + n + 0`.
   - Substituting `n = 0`, we get `h = 0 // (-k + 1) + 0 + 0`.
   - Since `k` is a positive integer, `-k + 1` is a negative integer or zero (if `k = 1`), but since `n` is less than `k`, `k` must be greater than 1.
   - Therefore, `0 // (-k + 1)` is `0` because the floor division of 0 by any non-zero number is 0.
   - Thus, `h = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`.

5. **Condition `h < k`:**
   - We have `h = 0` and `k` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - Therefore, `h < k` is always true.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
The code snippet simply prints the string `'NO'`. The values of the variables and conditions do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
