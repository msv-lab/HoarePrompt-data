The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `n` and `k`, but this information does not affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **NO**
