Output State: **`n` is `0`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is less than `k`, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n + 0`, `i` is `1`, `curr` is `0`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` is `0`:** After the loop completes, `n` is reduced to `0` because the loop continues to subtract multiples of the elements in `costs` from `n` until `n` becomes `0`.
- **`k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18:** The value of `k` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`n` is not equal to `k`:** Since `n` is reduced to `0` and `k` is a positive integer, `n` will never be equal to `k` after the loop.
- **`n` is less than `k`:** After the loop, `n` is `0`, which is always less than any positive integer `k`.
- **`costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`:** The list `costs` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n + 0`:** The variable `h` accumulates the sum of the quotients of `n` divided by each element in `costs` during each iteration. After the loop, `h` is the sum of these quotients.
- **`i` is `1`:** The last element processed in the loop is `1`.
- **`curr` is `0`:** In the final iteration, `curr` is `0` because `n` is already `0` and dividing `0` by any positive integer results in `0`.
