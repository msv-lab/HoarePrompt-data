Let's analyze the initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is `0`.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- `n` is less than `k`.
- `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n + 0`.
- `i` is `1`.
- `curr` is `0`.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `n`**: 
   - `n` is `0`.

2. **Value of `k`**:
   - `k` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).

3. **Value of `costs`**:
   - `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - Substituting `n = 0`, we get `costs = [0 - k + 1, 1] = [-k + 1, 1]`.

4. **Value of `h`**:
   - `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n + 0`.
   - Substituting `n = 0`, we get `h = 0 // (-k + 1) + 0 + 0`.
   - Since `k` is a positive integer, `-k + 1` is a negative integer or zero. Therefore, `0 // (-k + 1)` is `0` (integer division of 0 by any non-zero number is 0).
   - Thus, `h = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`.

5. **Condition `h` is greater than or equal to `k`**:
   - This condition states that `h >= k`.
   - From the previous calculation, `h = 0`.
   - For `h` to be greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be `0` or less, but since `k` is a positive integer, this condition cannot be true with the given values.

However, the condition `h >= k` is given as part of the initial state, so we must assume it holds true despite the apparent contradiction. This suggests that there might be an implicit assumption or additional context not explicitly stated.

### Print Statement:
The code snippet contains the following print statement:
```python
print(2)
```

### Conclusion:
The print statement will simply print the integer `2`, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **2**
