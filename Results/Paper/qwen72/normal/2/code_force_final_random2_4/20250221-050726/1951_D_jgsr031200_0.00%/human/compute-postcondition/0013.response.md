Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k; `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is 0, `i` is `n - k + 1`, `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`**.

Explanation:
- `curr` is assigned the value of `n // i`.
- `i` is the first element of `costs`, which is `n - k + 1`.
- Therefore, `curr` is calculated as `n // (n - k + 1)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
