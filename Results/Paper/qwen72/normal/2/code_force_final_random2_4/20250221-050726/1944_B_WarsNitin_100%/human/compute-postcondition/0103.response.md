Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `l` has `len(l)` elements, `ans1` includes all elements of `l` up to the point where `k` became 0, `ans2` includes all elements of `l` up to the point where `k` became 0, `k` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `req` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `q` is `len(l)`, `t` must be greater than `len(l)`**

Explanation:
- The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`.
- `k` is set to 0 in the initial state, but the new value of `k` from the input will overwrite this.
- All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
