The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `c` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 3, the element at index 3 of `c` is appended to `ans2`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans2` now includes the element at index 3 of `c`.**
