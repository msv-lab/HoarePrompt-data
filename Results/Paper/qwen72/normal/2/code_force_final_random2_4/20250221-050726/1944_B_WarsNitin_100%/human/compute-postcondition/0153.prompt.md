Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`i` is `-1`, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`. If `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `l` also contains the element `b[n - 1]`. If `b[n - 2] == b[n - 1]`, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the last element of `b` (which is `b[n-1]`), and `k` is `-2`. Otherwise, `ans1` and `ans2` remain empty lists, and `k` is `0`. `n` is an input integer, `req` is `0`, `m` remains unchanged, `q` is `0`, `t` must be greater than `0`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, now sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, and `k` is either -2 or 0. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[1]` is equal to `b[0]`, `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` twice. If `b[1]` is not equal to `b[0]`, `k` is 0, and `b[1]` is not equal to `b[2]`, `l` now includes the value of `b[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, and `k` is either -2 or 0. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `k` is -4, and `ans1` now includes the elements at index 2 and index 2 of `b`. The program does not break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i] != b[i - 1]`, `l` is a list that now includes the element `b[2]` if `b[i] != b[i + 1]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` remains -2, and the program continues executing. If `b[i] == b[i + 1]`, the program continues executing without modifying `l` or `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, and `k` is either -2 or 0. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is -2 and `b[3] == b[2]`, `k` is set to -4, and `ans1` now includes the elements at index 2 and index 3 of `b`. If `k` is -2 and `b[3] != b[2]` and `b[3] != b[4]`, `l` is a list that includes the element `b[2]`. If `k` is -2 and `b[3] == b[4]`, the program continues executing without modifying `l` or `k`. If `k` is -2 and `b[3] != b[2]` and `b[3] != b[4]`, `l` is a list that includes the elements `b[2]` and `b[3]`. If `k` is -2 and `b[3] == b[4]`, the program continues executing without modifying `l` or `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
