To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 2

The loop condition is `i in range(1, n - 1)`, which means the loop will continue as long as `i` is between 1 (inclusive) and `n - 1` (exclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 2

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 2 to ensure that `i` (which is now 2) is within the range.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**.
