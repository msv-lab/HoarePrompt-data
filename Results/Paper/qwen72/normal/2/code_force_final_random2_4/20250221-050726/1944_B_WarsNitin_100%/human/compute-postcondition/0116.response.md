The code `l.append(b[n - 1])` appends the element at index `n - 1` of the list `b` to the list `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `-1`
- `l` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`
- `ans1` is an empty list
- `ans2` is an empty list
- `k` is `0`
- `n` is an input integer
- `req` is `0`
- `m` remains unchanged
- `q` is `0`
- `t` must be greater than `0`
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user
- `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order
- `c` is the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, now sorted in ascending order

After executing the code:
- `l` will contain the element at index `n - 1` of `b` appended to its existing elements.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `-1`, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, and now also contains the element `b[n - 1]`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is `0`, `n` is an input integer, `req` is `0`, `m` remains unchanged, `q` is `0`, `t` must be greater than `0`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, now sorted in ascending order.**
