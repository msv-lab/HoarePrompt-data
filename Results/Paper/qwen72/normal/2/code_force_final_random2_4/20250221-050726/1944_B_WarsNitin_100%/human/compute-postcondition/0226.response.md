The value of `b[i]` is appended to the list `ans1`. Since `i` is 1, the value of `b[1]` is appended to `ans1`. The current value of `b[1]` is equal to the current value of `b[0]`. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, the current value of `b[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` which is equal to the value of `b[0]`.**
