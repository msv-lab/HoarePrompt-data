Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` is either `req` or `req - 2`, and `ans2` does not change. If `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]`, `k` is decremented by 2, and `ans2` includes the value of `c[2]` twice. If `k` is 0, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their preceding or following elements. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
