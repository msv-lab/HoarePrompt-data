Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is an empty list if `b[n-2]` is not equal to `b[n-1]`, otherwise `ans1` is a list containing the element `b[n-1]` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is now equal to 2 times its original value minus 2 if `b[n-2]` is equal to `b[n-1]`, otherwise `k` is 2 times its original value, `req` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if the first element of `b` is not equal to the second element of `b`, otherwise `l` is an empty list, and if `b[n-2]` is not equal to `b[n-1]`, `l` now contains the last element of `b` (`b[n-1]`).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `k` is -2, and `ans1` contains two elements, both equal to `b[1]`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, and `l` now contains the value of `b[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `b[2] == b[1]`, `k` is reduced by 2, and `ans1` now contains the elements at index 2 of `b` appended to its previous content. If `b[2] != b[1]`, and `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `b[2] != b[3]`, `l` now includes the element at index 2 of `b`. If `b[2] == b[3]`, `l` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If `b[3]` equals `b[2]`, `k` is -2, and `ans1` now contains the element at index 3 of `b` appended to its previous contents. If `b[3]` does not equal `b[2]`, and `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `b[3]` does not equal `b[4]`, `l` now contains the element at index 3 of `b`. If `b[3]` equals `b[4]`, `l` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
