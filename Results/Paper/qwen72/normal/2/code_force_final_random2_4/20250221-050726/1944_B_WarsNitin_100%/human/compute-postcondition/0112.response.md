The code snippet `req = k` assigns the value of `k` to `req`. Since `k` is 0, `req` is also set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `l` has `len(l)` elements, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `req` is 0, `m` remains unchanged, `q` is `len(l)`, `t` must be greater than `len(l)`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, now sorted in ascending order.**
