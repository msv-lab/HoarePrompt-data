Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is now equal to `req`, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their preceding or following elements.** 

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated to the value of `req`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `ans1`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
