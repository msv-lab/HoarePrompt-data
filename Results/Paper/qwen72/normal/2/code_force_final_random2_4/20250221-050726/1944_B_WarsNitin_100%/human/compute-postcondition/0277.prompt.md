Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is `req`, `ans1` contains the repeated elements from `b` where `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, and `l` contains the unique elements from `b` that are not equal to their next element `b[i + 1]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[1]` is equal to `c[0]`, `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` and now also contains the value of `c[1]` appended to it, and `k` is decreased by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `k` is -2, and `ans2` now contains the element at index 2 of `c` appended to its previous content. If `c[i] != c[i - 1]`, `k` remains 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[3]` equals `c[2]`, `ans2` now includes the element at index 3 of `c`, and `k` is decreased by 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
