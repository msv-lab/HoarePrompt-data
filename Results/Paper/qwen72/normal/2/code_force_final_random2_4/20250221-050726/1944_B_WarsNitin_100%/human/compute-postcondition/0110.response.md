Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `l` has `len(l)` elements, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `req` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `q` is `len(l)`, `t` must be greater than `len(l)`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, now sorted in ascending order.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `ans2 = []` reassigns `ans2` to an empty list, overriding its previous value which included all elements of `l` up to the point where `k` became 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
