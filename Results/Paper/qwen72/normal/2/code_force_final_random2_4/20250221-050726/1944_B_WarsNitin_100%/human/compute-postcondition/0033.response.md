Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`. The current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`. `l` now contains the value of `b[1]`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i]` (which is `b[1]` since `i` is 1) to the list `l`. The other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
