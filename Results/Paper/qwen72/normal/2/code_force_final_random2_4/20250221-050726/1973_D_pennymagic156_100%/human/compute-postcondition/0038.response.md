Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
- `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `i` is 1.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` (a value less than `n + 1`).
- Additionally, `cnt` is 0 and `l` is equal to `n + 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`:**
   - According to the initial state, `i` is 1.

2. **Value of `v`:**
   - The value of `v` is determined by the condition: `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
   - Since `i` is 1, and there is no indication that `i` ever changes to `n`, `v` will be 1.

3. **Value of `l`:**
   - The initial state states that `l` is `func_2() + 1` and also that `l` is equal to `n + 1`.
   - This implies that `func_2()` returns `n`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)`.
   - Substituting the values of `i` and `v`:
     - `i` is 1.
     - `v` is 1.
   - Therefore, `i * v` is `1 * 1` which is 1.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the string `! 1` with a flush.

Output: **! 1**
