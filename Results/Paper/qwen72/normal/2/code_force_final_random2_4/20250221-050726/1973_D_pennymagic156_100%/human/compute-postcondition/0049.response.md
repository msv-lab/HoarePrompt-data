To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the values of the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
- `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `i` is 2.
- `cnt` is `k - 1`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**: Given directly as `i = 2`.
2. **Value of `v`**: Since `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, and `i` is 2, `v` will be 1 because there is no `i` that equals `n` in the given context.
3. **Value of `cnt`**: `cnt` is `k - 1`.
4. **Value of `l`**: `l` is `func_2() + 1`. Without knowing the implementation of `func_2()`, we cannot determine the exact value of `l`. However, we know that `l` is the result of `func_2()` plus 1.
5. **Condition**: Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`. This condition ensures that the print statement will execute under the given constraints.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Calculation:
- `i * v` = 2 * 1 = 2
- `l` = `func_2() + 1` (unknown value, but it will be some integer + 1)

### Output:
The print statement will output a string where `l` is the result of `func_2() + 1` and `i * v` is 2.

Output: **? [l] 2 (where l is the value of func_2() + 1)**
