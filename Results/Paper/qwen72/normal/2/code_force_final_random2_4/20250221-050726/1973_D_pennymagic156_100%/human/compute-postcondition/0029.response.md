To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
   - `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `cnt` is `k - 1`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `func_2() < n`.

2. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists. Since `i` is 1, `v` will be 1 (because `i` is already 1 and it does not need to be set to `n`).
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` is some function that returns a value less than `n`. Let's denote the return value of `func_2()` as `x`, where \( 0 \leq x < n \). Therefore, `l` will be `x + 1`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)`.
   - Substituting the values:
     - `l` is `x + 1`.
     - `i` is 1.
     - `v` is 1.
   - Therefore, `i * v` is `1 * 1` which is 1.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output:
```
? {x + 1} 1
```

Since `x` is the return value of `func_2()` and \( 0 \leq x < n \), the exact value of `x` is not specified, but it is known to be within this range.

Output: **? [x + 1] 1 (where x is the return value of func_2() and 0 â‰¤ x < n)**
