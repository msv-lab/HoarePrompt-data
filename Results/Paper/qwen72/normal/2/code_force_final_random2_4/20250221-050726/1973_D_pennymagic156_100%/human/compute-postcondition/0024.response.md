To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

### Variables in the Loop Condition:
- `cnt`: This variable is part of the loop condition and must be non-zero for the loop to execute.
- `l`: This variable is part of the loop condition and must be less than `n + 1` for the loop to execute.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
- `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `i` is 1.
- `cnt` is `k`.
- `l` is 1.

### Analysis:
1. **`cnt`**: The initial value of `cnt` is `k`, which is a positive integer (since \( 1 \leq k \leq n \)). Therefore, `cnt` is non-zero, and this part of the condition is satisfied.
2. **`l`**: The initial value of `l` is 1. For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `n` is a positive integer and \( n \geq 1 \), `n + 1` is at least 2. Therefore, `l` being 1 satisfies the condition `l < n + 1`.

Since both conditions (`cnt` being non-zero and `l` being less than `n + 1`) are already satisfied with the given initial state, no adjustments are needed.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 1, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is 1**
