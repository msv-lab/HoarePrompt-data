Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = func_2() + 1` updates the value of `l` to be the result of `func_2()` plus 1.
- The initial state already specifies that `l` is `func_2() + 1`, so the value of `l` remains the same after the code execution.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `v`, `i`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.
- The condition "either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`" remains valid as it was in the initial state.
