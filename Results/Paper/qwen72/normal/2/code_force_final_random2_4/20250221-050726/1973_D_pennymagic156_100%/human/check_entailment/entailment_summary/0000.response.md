### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The function `func_5` starts by reading the values of `n` and `k` using `func_3`, which correctly parses the input as two integers.
   - It initializes `v` to 1, which will later be used to store the maximum value found during the initial queries.

2. **Initial Queries to Find Maximum Value:**
   - The function iterates from `n` down to 1, making queries of the form `? 1 {i * n}`. This query checks if there is a subarray starting from index 1 with a value of `i * n`.
   - If the response `v` is equal to `n`, it means the subarray from 1 to `n` has a value of `i * n`, and `v` is set to `i`. This step helps in finding the maximum possible value `m` that could be used to split the array.

3. **Finding Subarrays with the Same Value:**
   - The function then iterates through possible values of `i` from 1 to `n // k + 1`.
   - For each `i`, it attempts to find subarrays of length `i * v` starting from different positions.
   - It makes queries of the form `? {l} {i * v}` to find the smallest `r` such that the subarray from `l` to `r` has a value of `i * v`.
   - If it successfully finds `k` such subarrays that cover the entire array, it prints `! {i * v}` and exits the function.
   - If it fails to find such subarrays, it prints `! -1`.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The main loop `for _ in range(int(input())):` ensures that the function `func_5` is called for each test case, as specified in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
- The function `func_5` correctly implements the logic to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the same value `m`.
- It handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.
- The queries are made within the allowed limit of `2 * n` queries per test case.
- The function correctly prints the answer and handles the interaction with the judge.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
