To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

### Conditions Analysis:
1. **`cnt`**: The loop will continue as long as `cnt` is not zero.
2. **`l < n + 1`**: The loop will continue as long as `l` is less than `n + 1`.

### Current State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
- `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `i` is 2.
- `cnt` is `k - 2`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`cnt`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be non-zero. Given that `cnt` is `k - 2`, and `k` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `cnt` will be non-zero as long as `k > 2`. Since `k` is at least 1, `cnt` will be non-zero if `k` is greater than 2.
- **`l`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than `n + 1`. Given that `l` is `func_2() + 1`, we need to ensure that `func_2()` returns a value such that `l` is less than `n + 1`.

### Conclusion:
- `cnt` must be non-zero, which means `k` must be greater than 2.
- `l` must be less than `n + 1`, which means `func_2()` must return a value such that `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Since `cnt` and `l` are the only variables in the loop head that can be adjusted, and they must satisfy the conditions for the loop to execute one more time, the state should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \) and `k > 2`, `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l < n + 1`**.
