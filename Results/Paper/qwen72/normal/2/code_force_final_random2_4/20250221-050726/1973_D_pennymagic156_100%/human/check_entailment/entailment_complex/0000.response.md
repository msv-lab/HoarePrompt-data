Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are used to read different types of input from the standard input. These functions are straightforward and correctly handle the input as described in the problem statement.

2. **Main Logic in `func_5`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function `func_5` starts by reading `n` and `k` using `func_3`.
   - **Finding the Maximum Value**:
     - The function iterates from `n` down to `1` and makes queries to find the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`. If `v` (the result of the query) equals `n`, it sets `v` to `i` and breaks out of the loop. This part is intended to find the maximum possible value `m` such that `f(1, r) = m` for some `r`.
   - **Checking Subarrays**:
     - The function then iterates through possible values of `i` from `1` to `n // k + 1` to check if the array can be split into `k` subarrays where each subarray has the same value `m = i * v`.
     - For each `i`, it makes queries to find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * v` starting from `l = 1` and moving forward. If it successfully finds `k` such subarrays, it prints the answer `! {i * v}` and returns.
   - **No Valid Split**:
     - If no valid split is found, it prints `! -1`.

3. **Query Limits**:
   - The function ensures that the number of queries does not exceed `2 * n` by carefully managing the queries within the loops.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as `k = 1` and `n = 1` correctly. For `k = 1`, the function will always find a valid split, and for `n = 1`, the function will correctly identify the single element as the answer.

5. **Flushing Output**:
   - The function uses `flush=True` in the `print` statements to ensure that the output is flushed immediately, which is necessary for interactive problems.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
