Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l < n + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `k`**: These remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`v`**: This also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: This remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`cnt`**: The loop decrements `cnt` by 1 each time it runs. Since the loop runs until `cnt` is 0, after all iterations, `cnt` will be 0.
- **`l`**: `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1` each time the loop runs. After the loop finishes, `l` will be the result of the last call to `func_2() + 1`, and it must still be less than `n + 1` for the loop to have completed successfully.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations is as described above.
