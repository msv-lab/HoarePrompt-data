The function `func_5` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the context provided, it seems to involve operations with two positive integers `n` and `k` where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4. The function does not return any value but may print a specific message depending on the conditions met within the function's logic.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but involves operations with two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^4). It does not return any value. In certain conditions, it prints `! {i * v}`, where `i` is the last value of `i` before the loop terminates, and `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.**
