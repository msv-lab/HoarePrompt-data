To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
l = func_2() + 1
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
   - `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `cnt` is `k`.
   - `l` is 1.
   - Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The line `l = func_2() + 1` is executed.
   - The function `func_2()` is called, and its return value is added to 1.
   - The result of this addition is assigned to `l`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - The value of `l` changes from 1 to `func_2() + 1`.
   - All other variables (`n`, `k`, `v`, `i`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

### Output State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
- `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `i` is 2.
- `cnt` is `k`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**
