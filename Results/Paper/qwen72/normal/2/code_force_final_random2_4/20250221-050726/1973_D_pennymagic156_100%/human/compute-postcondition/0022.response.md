To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
- `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `i` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and `k`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(1, n // k + 1)` contains at least one element. This means that `n // k + 1` must be greater than 1.
3. **Initial State of `i`**: The loop variable `i` starts from 1, not 0. Therefore, the initial state of `i` should be adjusted to 1.
4. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute, `n // k + 1` must be greater than 1. This simplifies to `n // k >= 1`, which is always true given the constraints \( 1 \leq k \leq n \).

### Adjusted State:
- `i` must be 1 (the starting value of the loop).
- `n` and `k` must satisfy \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \) to ensure the loop can execute.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, and `i` is 1**.
