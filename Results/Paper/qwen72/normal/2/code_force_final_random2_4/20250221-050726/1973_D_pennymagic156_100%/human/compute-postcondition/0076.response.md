Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 3, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and `l < n + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `k`**: These remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`v`**: This also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: This remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`cnt`**: Initially set to `k`, `cnt` is decremented by 1 with each iteration of the loop. After `k` iterations, `cnt` will be 0.
- **`l`**: `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1` in each iteration. The exact value of `l` depends on the return value of `func_2()`, but it is guaranteed that `l < n + 1` for the loop to continue executing.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, `cnt` will be 0, and `l` will be `func_2() + 1`, with the condition that `l < n + 1` still holding true.
