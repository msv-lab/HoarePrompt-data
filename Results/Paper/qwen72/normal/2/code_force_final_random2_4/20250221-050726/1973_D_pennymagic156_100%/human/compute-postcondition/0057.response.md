Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l` is equal to `n + 1`. Additionally, `cnt` is currently 0 and `l` is currently equal to `n + 1`.**
