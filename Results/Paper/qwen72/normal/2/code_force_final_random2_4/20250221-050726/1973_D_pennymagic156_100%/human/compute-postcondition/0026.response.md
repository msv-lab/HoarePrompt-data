Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 1, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `v`, `i`, `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
