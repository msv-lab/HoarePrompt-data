Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 <= n <= 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an input integer, the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `_` is 1, `T` must be greater than 0, `list0` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 2, `num` is `list0[3] - list0[2] - 1`. If `num` is 1, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `num` is updated to `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`.
- Since `i` is 2, `num` is now `list0[3] - list0[2] - 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
