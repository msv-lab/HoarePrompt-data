The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` depends on the value of `num`. If `num` is 1, `count` starts at 2; otherwise, `count` starts at 1. After incrementing, if `num` is 1, `count` becomes 3; otherwise, `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `x` is an input integer where \(2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \times 10^5)\) and `x` must be greater than 3, `y` is an input integer, `_` is 2, `T` must be greater than 0, `list0` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 2, `num` is `list0[3] - list0[2] - 1`, if `num` is 1, `count` is 3. Otherwise, `count` is 2.**
