The code snippet `num = n - list0[-1]` calculates the difference between `n` and the last element of the `list0`. This difference is stored in the variable `num`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 10^9\)
- `x` is an input integer where \(2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \times 10^5)\)
- `y` is an input integer
- `_` is 2
- `T` must be greater than 0
- `list0` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input
- `i` is `x - 2`
- `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` (from index 0 to `x-2`) is exactly 1

After executing the code snippet:
- `num` is assigned the value `n - list0[-1]`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `x` is an input integer where \(2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \times 10^5)\), `y` is an input integer, `_` is 2, `T` must be greater than 0, `list0` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `x - 2`, `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` (from index 0 to `x-2`) is exactly 1, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`.**
