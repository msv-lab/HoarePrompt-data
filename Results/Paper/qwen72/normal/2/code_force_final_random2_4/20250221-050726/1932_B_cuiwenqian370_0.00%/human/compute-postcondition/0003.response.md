Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `path` is a string containing `n` space-separated integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), `data` is a list of strings containing the split input, `index` is 1.** 

The variable `index` is set to 1, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `path`, and `data`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
