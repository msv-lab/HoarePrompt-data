Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the year when the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The key points are:
- Each sign occurs at regular intervals.
- Signs must occur sequentially.
- The year of the nth sign is the answer.

However, the provided functions do not match the requirements of the problem:
- `func_1` is designed to process a list of strings representing a path and count the maximum number of consecutive '@' characters without encountering a '*'. This function is not relevant to the problem of calculating the year of the nth sign.
- `func_2` reads input and processes multiple test cases, but it incorrectly uses `func_1` to process the periodicities of the signs. The periodicities should be used to calculate the year of the nth sign, not to count '@' characters in a path.

Given that the functions do not perform the required calculations to solve the problem, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
