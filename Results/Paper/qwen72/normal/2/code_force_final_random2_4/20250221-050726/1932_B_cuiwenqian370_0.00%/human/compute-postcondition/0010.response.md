Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index-3]`, `index` is incremented by 2, `path` is `data[index-2]`, `results` now includes the result of `func_1(path)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
- The value of `n` remains the integer value of `data[index-3]`.
- The value of `index` is incremented by 2.
- The value of `path` is still `data[index-2]`.
- The list `results` now includes the result of the function `func_1(path)`.
