Functionality: ** The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case involves reading a number of signs and their periodicities, then applying a function (`func_1`) to these periodicities. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results of `func_1` for each test case. After the function completes, the input data has been fully processed, and the results have been printed to the standard output. **
