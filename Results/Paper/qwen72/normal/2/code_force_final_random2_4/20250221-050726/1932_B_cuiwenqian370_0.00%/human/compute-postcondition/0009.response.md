Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index-3]`, `index` is incremented by 2, `path` is `data[index-2]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by 1 again, making it a total increment of 2 from its initial state.
- Since `index` was initially incremented by 1, the new value of `n` is now the integer value of `data[index-3]`.
- The new value of `path` is now `data[index-2]`.
- The condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
- All other conditions and values remain as they were in the initial state.
