You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. n is a positive integer representing the number of signs, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. path is a string containing n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        path = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        results.append(func_1(path))
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `index` is `2 * t + 1` (where `t` is the initial value of `t`), `path` is `data[index - 1]`, `results` contains the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `index` is 1, `path` is `data[0]`, `results` must be a list with all elements processed, and `result` is the last element in `results`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` (number of signs), and `path` (a string of space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs). It processes the periodicities for each test case and returns a specific output based on these periodicities.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
