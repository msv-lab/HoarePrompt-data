Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the year when the nth sign occurs, given the periodicity of each sign. However, the provided functions do not seem to address this problem correctly. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is designed to process a list of strings (`path`) and calculate the maximum number of consecutive '@' characters without encountering a '*' character. This is not related to the problem of finding the year when the nth sign occurs based on periodicities.
   - The function uses dynamic programming to solve a different problem, which is not relevant to the given problem statement.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The input is read as a list of strings, and the function attempts to parse the number of signs and their periodicities.
   - However, the function incorrectly treats the periodicities as a single string (`path`), which is then passed to `func_1`. This is a significant error because `func_1` expects a list of strings, not a single string of numbers.

Given the above analysis, the provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as described. The functions are designed to solve a different problem and are not aligned with the requirements of the given problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
