The provided code defines a lambda function `r` that reads input from the user, splits it by spaces, and maps each split part to an integer. This function `r` can now be used to read multiple integers from a single line of input.

Given the initial state, the only change is the introduction of the function `r`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `m`, and the pairs `(x_i, y_i)` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of: `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities; a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, representing the positions of the cities on the number line; `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries; and `m` pairs of integers `(x_i, y_i)` where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the queries. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. A function `r` is defined to read multiple integers from a single line of input.**
