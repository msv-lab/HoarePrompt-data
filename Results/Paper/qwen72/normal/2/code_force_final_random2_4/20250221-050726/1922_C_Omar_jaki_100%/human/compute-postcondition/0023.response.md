To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the statement itself step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is the integer read from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0.
2. `a` must have at least 4 elements.
3. `b` is a list with the final values computed by the loop, where each element in `b` is the cumulative sum of the conditions evaluated during the loop iterations.
4. `u` is `False`.
5. `c` is the first element returned by `r()`.
6. `d` is the second element returned by `r()`.
7. `c` is less than `d`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `b`**: 
   - `b` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of conditions evaluated during the loop iterations. This means `b` contains values that are the result of some cumulative computation.

2. **Indices Calculation**:
   - `(d - 1) * 2`: This calculates the index in the list `b` based on the value of `d`.
   - `(c - 1) * 2`: This calculates the index in the list `b` based on the value of `c`.

3. **Values of `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are the first and second elements returned by the function `r()`, respectively.
   - It is given that `c` is less than `d`.

4. **Accessing Elements in `b`**:
   - `b[(d - 1) * 2]`: This accesses the element in `b` at the index `(d - 1) * 2`.
   - `b[(c - 1) * 2]`: This accesses the element in `b` at the index `(c - 1) * 2`.

5. **Subtraction**:
   - The expression `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` subtracts the value at index `(c - 1) * 2` from the value at index `(d - 1) * 2`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the difference between the values at the specified indices in the list `b`.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where b[(d - 1) * 2] is the value at index (d - 1) * 2 in the list b, and b[(c - 1) * 2] is the value at index (c - 1) * 2 in the list b)**
