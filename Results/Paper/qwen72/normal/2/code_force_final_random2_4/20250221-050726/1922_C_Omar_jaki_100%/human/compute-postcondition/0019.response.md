The code snippet `u -= 1` decrements the value of `u` by 1. Since `u` initially evaluates to `True`, which is equivalent to the integer value 1 in Python, decrementing `u` by 1 results in `u` being 0, which is equivalent to `False`.

The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list with the final values computed by the loop, where each element in `b` is the cumulative sum of the conditions evaluated during the loop iterations, `u` is now 0 (False).**
