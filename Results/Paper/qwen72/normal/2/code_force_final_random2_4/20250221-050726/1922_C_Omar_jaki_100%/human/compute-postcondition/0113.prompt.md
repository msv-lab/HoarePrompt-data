Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `a` remains a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by `t + 2` values returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`. The variable `b` will have been updated to contain `t + 4` elements, where each element is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, `b` will start with `[0, 0]` and then append `t + 2` new elements, each of which is the sum of the previous two elements in `b` plus a value determined by the condition `v > x - w` or `v > z - y`. The values of `t`, `u`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged. Additionally, `u` is now assigned the first value returned by `r()`.
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *After the loop has executed all iterations, `a` remains a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by `t + 2` values returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`. The variable `b` will have been updated to contain `t + 4` elements, where each element is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, `b` will start with `[0, 0]` and then append `t + 2` new elements, each of which is the sum of the previous two elements in `b` plus a value determined by the condition `v > x - w` or `v > z - y`. The values of `t` and `u` remain unchanged except that `u` is now one less than its previous value (which was the first value returned by `r()` and evaluated to `True`). The new values of `c` and `d` are the next two values returned by `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`a` remains a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by `t + 2` values returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`. `b` will have been updated to contain `t + 4` elements, where each element is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified in the loop. `t` remains unchanged. `u` is now one less than its previous value (which was the first value returned by `r()` and evaluated to `True`). `c` and `d` are the next two values returned by `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`a` remains a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by `t + 2` values returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`. `b` will have been updated to contain `t + 4` elements, where each element is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified in the loop. `t` remains unchanged. `u` is now two less than its original value (which was the first value returned by `r()` and evaluated to `True`) and must still evaluate to `True`. `c` and `d` are the next two values returned by `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
