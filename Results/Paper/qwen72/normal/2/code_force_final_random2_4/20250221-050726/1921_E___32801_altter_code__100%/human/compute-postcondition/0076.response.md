The value of `c` is calculated as `m - y2`. Given that `m` is `r[1]` and `y2` is `r[5] + a`, `c` becomes `r[1] - (r[5] + a)`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + (m - y1)`, `y1` is `m`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5] + a`, `b` is `(r[4] - a) - x1`, `t` is `abs((r[5] + a) - m)`, `c` is `r[1] - (r[5] + a)`, `x2 > x1`, `x1 >= 1`, `x2 <= n`, and `y1 > y2`.**
