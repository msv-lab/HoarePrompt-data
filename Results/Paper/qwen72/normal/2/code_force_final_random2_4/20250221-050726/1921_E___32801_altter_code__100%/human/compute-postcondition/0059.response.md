Postcondition: ***`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2]`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`. If `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, then `a` is set to `y1 - 1`. Otherwise, if `y2` is less than `y1`, then `a` is set to `m - y1`.***
