Postcondition: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `b` is `(r[4] - a) - x1`, `x2 > x1`, `x1 >= 1`, `x2 <= n`. If `y1 <= y2`, then `x1` is `r[2]`, `y1` is `1`, `y2` is `r[5] - a`, `t` is `abs(r[5] - 1)`, and `c` is `r[5] - a - 1`. If `y1 > y2`, then `x1` is `r[2] + (m - y1)`, `y1` is `m`, `y2` is `r[5] + a`, `t` is `abs((r[5] + a) - m)`, and `c` is `r[1] - (r[5] + a)`.**
