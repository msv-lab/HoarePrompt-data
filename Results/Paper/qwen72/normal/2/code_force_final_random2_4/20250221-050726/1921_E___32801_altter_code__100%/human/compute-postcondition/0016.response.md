Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1`, `y1` is `r[3] - 1`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `r` is a list of integers input by the user, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`. Furthermore, `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`.**

Explanation: The value of `x1` is incremented by 1, changing from `r[2]` to `r[2] + 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
