Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided has a logical flaw in how it handles certain edge cases. Specifically, the program incorrectly determines the outcome of the game in scenarios where the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips are such that Bob can win immediately or in a few moves, but the program does not correctly account for these situations.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
h = 5, w = 5, x_a = 1, y_a = 3, x_b = 2, y_b = 3
```
In this scenario, Bob is directly above Alice, and on his first move, Bob can move his chip to the same position as Alice's chip (i.e., (2, 3) to (1, 3)), winning the game. However, the provided program does not correctly handle this case and may incorrectly output "Draw" or "Alice" instead of "Bob".

This indicates that the program does not fully capture the optimal strategies for both players, leading to incorrect outcomes in certain scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
