Postcondition: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + (y1 - 1)` if `y2 >= y1` or `r[2] + (m - y1)` if `y2 < y1`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `b` is `(r[4] - a) - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`. Additionally, either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.**
