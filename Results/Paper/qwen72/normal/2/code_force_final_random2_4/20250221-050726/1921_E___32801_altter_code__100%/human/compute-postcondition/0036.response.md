Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is 1, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`, `y1` is `r[3] + 1`, `a` is `r[5] - 1`, `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, which is an odd number, `t` is `abs(r[5] - y1)`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The value of `y2` is updated to 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
