Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + (m - y1)`, `y1` is `m`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `b` is `(r[4] - a) - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - m)`. Additionally, `x2 > x1`, `x1 >= 1`, `x2 <= n`, and `y1 > y2`.**

Explanation:
- `y1` is updated to be equal to `m`.
- The value of `x1` is recalculated as `r[2] + (m - y1)`, which simplifies to `r[2]` since `y1` is now `m`.
- The value of `b` is recalculated as `(r[4] - a) - x1`, which remains the same as before.
- The value of `t` is recalculated as `abs(y2 - y1)`, which now becomes `abs(r[5] - m)`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
