The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'draw'`. The initial state provides details about several variables (`n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) derived from a list `r` input by the user, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is `r[0]`
- `m` is `r[1]`
- `x1` is `r[2]`
- `y1` is `r[3]`
- `x2` is `r[4]`
- `y2` is `r[5]`
- `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'draw'`.

Therefore, the output of the code is:
Output: **draw**
