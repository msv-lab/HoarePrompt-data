The function `func_1` is not correctly defined for the problem. The correct function definition should include parameters for the board dimensions and the initial positions of the chips, such as `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an additional parameter `t` for the number of test cases.
