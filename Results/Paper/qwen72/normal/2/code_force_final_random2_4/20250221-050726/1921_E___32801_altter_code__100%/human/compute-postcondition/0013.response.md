Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1`, `y1` is `r[3] + 1`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`. The current value of `y2` is greater than `y1`.**

Explanation:
- `x1` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `r[2] + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, and `y1` is not equal to `y2` with `y2` being greater than `y1` still hold true.
