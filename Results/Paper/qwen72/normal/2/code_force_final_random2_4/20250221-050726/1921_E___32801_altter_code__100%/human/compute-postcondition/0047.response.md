Postcondition: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is either 1 or `m`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, which is an odd number, `t` is `abs(r[5] - y1)`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. If `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`, then `y1` is `r[3] - r[5] + 2`, `a` is `r[5] - 1`, and `c` is `y1 - 1`. Otherwise, if `y2` is greater than `y1`, then `y1` is `r[3] - 1 + a`, `a` is `r[1] - r[5]`, and `c` is `m - y1`. Additionally, either `b // 2` is less than or equal to `a`, or `abs(x2 - c)` is less than `x1 + c`, or `y1` is less than 1 or greater than `m`, or `x1` is less than 1 or greater than `n`.**
