The code snippet `t = abs(y2 - y1)` calculates the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` and assigns it to the variable `t`. Given the initial conditions, let's determine the output state:

- `n` is `r[0]`
- `m` is `r[1]`
- `x1` is `r[2]`
- `y1` is `r[3]`
- `x2` is `r[4]`
- `y2` is `r[5]`
- `x2` is greater than `x1`
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is even
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`
- `b` is `x2 - x1`
- If `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, then `a` is `y1 - 1`; otherwise, if `y2` is less than `y1`, then `a` is `m - y1`

The new variable `t` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.

Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2]`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, then `a` is `y1 - 1`; otherwise, if `y2` is less than `y1`, then `a` is `m - y1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`**
