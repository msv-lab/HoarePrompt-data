### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tt`) and iterates over them.
   - For each test case, it reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The program checks if `x2` (Bob's row) is less than or equal to `x1` (Alice's row). If so, it prints "draw" because Bob cannot move up to Alice's row.
   - This condition ensures that the game does not end in a draw due to Bob being unable to move.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The annotation confirms that the program correctly handles this condition.

3. **Odd and Even Differences:**
   - The program differentiates between the cases where `(x2 - x1) % 2` is odd or even.
   - If the difference is odd, it checks specific conditions to determine if Alice can win. If not, it prints "draw".
   - If the difference is even, it checks similar conditions to determine if Bob can win. If not, it prints "draw".
   - **Annotation Verification:** The annotations confirm that the program correctly handles the odd and even differences and the subsequent conditions.

4. **Winning Conditions:**
   - For Alice to win, the program checks if the positions align such that Alice can force a win by moving diagonally or vertically.
   - For Bob to win, the program checks if the positions align such that Bob can force a win by moving diagonally or vertically.
   - The program also ensures that the moves do not go out of bounds.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The annotations confirm that the program correctly checks the winning conditions and boundary constraints.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the chips are in the same column but different rows.
   - It also handles cases where the chips are in different columns and rows, ensuring that the moves are within the board boundaries.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The annotations confirm that the program correctly handles these edge cases.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem description and the constraints. It checks all necessary conditions to determine the outcome of the game for each test case. The annotations support the correctness of the program's logic and flow.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
