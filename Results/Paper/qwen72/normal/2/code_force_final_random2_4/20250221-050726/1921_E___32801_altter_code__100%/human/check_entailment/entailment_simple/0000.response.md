### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case, but it does not take any parameters. Instead, it reads input directly within the function, which is a common practice for competitive programming problems.
   - The function correctly parses the input into variables `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`.

2. **Initial Check for Draw:**
   - The first condition checks if `x2 <= x1`. If true, it prints "draw" and returns. This is correct because if Bob's chip is already in or above Alice's chip, Alice cannot win since she moves down and Bob moves up.

3. **Odd Difference Case:**
   - If the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd, the function checks if `y1 == y2`. If true, it prints "Alice" and returns. This is correct because if the vertical distance is odd and the horizontal positions are the same, Alice can always win by moving diagonally to match Bob's position.
   - If `y1 != y2`, the function adjusts `x1` and `y1` to simulate a move and checks again if `y1 == y2`. If true, it prints "Alice" and returns.
   - If `y1` and `y2` are still not equal, it calculates the minimum number of moves required to align the chips vertically and checks if the game can end in a draw. If not, it prints "Alice" if the conditions are met, otherwise "draw".

4. **Even Difference Case:**
   - If the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, the function checks if `y1 == y2`. If true, it prints "Bob" and returns. This is correct because if the vertical distance is even and the horizontal positions are the same, Bob can always win by moving diagonally to match Alice's position.
   - If `y1 != y2`, the function adjusts `x1` and `y1` to simulate a move and checks if the game can end in a draw. If not, it prints "Bob" if the conditions are met, otherwise "draw".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. It checks for the initial draw condition, handles the odd and even differences in the vertical positions, and simulates the moves to determine the winner or a draw. The logic and conditions used in the program are consistent with the rules of the game.

**Correctness: True**
