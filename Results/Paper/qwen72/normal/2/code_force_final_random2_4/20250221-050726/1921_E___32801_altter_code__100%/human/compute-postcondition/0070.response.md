Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + (1 - 1)`, `y1` is `1`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `b` is `(r[4] - a) - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - 1)`. Additionally, `x2 > x1`, `x1 >= 1`, `x2 <= n`, and `y1 <= y2`.**

Explanation:
- `y1` is set to 1.
- `x1` simplifies to `r[2]` because `y1` was initially `r[3]` and now is 1, so `x1` is `r[2] + (1 - 1)` which is `r[2]`.
- `t` is updated to `abs(y2 - 1)` since `y1` is now 1.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
