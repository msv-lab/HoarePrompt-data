To determine what will be printed by the `print('draw')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `n` is `r[0]`
- `m` is `r[1]`
- `x1` is `r[2] + (y1 - 1)` if `y2 >= y1` or `r[2] + (m - y1)` if `y2 < y1`
- `y1` is `r[3]`
- `x2` is `r[4] - a`
- `y2` is `r[5]`
- `b` is `(r[4] - a) - x1`
- `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`

### Conditions:
- Either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `n` and `m` are derived from the list `r`.
   - `y1` and `y2` are also derived from the list `r`.
   - `x1` is calculated based on the values of `r[2]`, `y1`, and `y2`.
   - `x2` is calculated based on the values of `r[4]` and `a`.
   - `b` is calculated based on the values of `r[4]`, `a`, and `x1`.
   - `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The condition states that either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('draw')`.

Given the conditions, the print statement will always execute and print the string `'draw'` because the conditions are used to determine the values of `x1` and `x2`, but they do not affect the execution of the print statement itself. The print statement is simply printing a constant string.

### Output:
Output: **draw**
