The code snippet `t = abs(y2 - y1)` calculates the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` and assigns this value to `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is `r[0]`
- `m` is `r[1]`
- `x1` is `r[2] + 1`
- `x2` is `r[4]`
- `y2` is `r[5]`
- `x2` is greater than `x1`
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`
- If `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] + 1` and `a` is `r[5] - 1`
- If `y1` is less than `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] - 1` and `a` is `r[1] - r[5]`
- `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, which is an odd number

The value of `t` is calculated as the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. Since `y1` and `y2` are already defined, `t` will be a specific value based on their difference.

Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, if `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] + 1` and `a` is `r[5] - 1`, otherwise if `y1` is less than `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] - 1` and `a` is `r[1] - r[5]`, `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, which is an odd number, `t` is `abs(r[5] - y1)`**
