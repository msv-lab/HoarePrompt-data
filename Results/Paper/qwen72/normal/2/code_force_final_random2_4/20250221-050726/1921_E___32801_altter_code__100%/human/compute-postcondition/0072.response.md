Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2]`, `y1` is `1`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5] - a`, `b` is `(r[4] - a) - r[2]`, `t` is `abs(r[5] - 1)`, `x2 > x1`, `x1 >= 1`, `x2 <= n`, `y1 <= y2`, `c` is `r[5] - a - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `y2 - 1` to the variable `c`. Since `y2` is `r[5] - a`, `c` becomes `r[5] - a - 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
