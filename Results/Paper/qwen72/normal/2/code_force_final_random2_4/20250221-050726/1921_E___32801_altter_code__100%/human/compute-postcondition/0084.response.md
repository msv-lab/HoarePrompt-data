Functionality: **The function `func_1` is intended to accept parameters for the board dimensions (`h`, `w`) and the initial positions of two chips (`x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`), along with an additional parameter `t` for the number of test cases. However, the function as defined does not accept any parameters and does not return any value in all specified cases.**
