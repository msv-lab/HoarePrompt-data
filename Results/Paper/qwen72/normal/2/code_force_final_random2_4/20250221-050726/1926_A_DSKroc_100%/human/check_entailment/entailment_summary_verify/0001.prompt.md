You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where each test case is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, the function counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string. It then prints 'A' if the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', otherwise, it prints 'B'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is correctly handled using `t = int(input())`.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program uses a loop `for q in range(t):` to iterate through each test case. This is appropriate since it processes each test case individually.

3. **Counting Characters**: Inside the loop, the program initializes two counters `ac` and `bc` to zero. These counters are used to keep track of the number of 'A' and 'B' characters in the string, respectively.

4. **Reading the String**: The program reads the string `s` using `s = input()`. This is correct as it reads the string for each test case.

5. **Character Counting Logic**: The program iterates over each character in the string `s` using `for i in s:`. For each character, it checks if the character is 'A' or 'B' and increments the respective counter (`ac` or `bc`).

6. **Determining the Most Frequent Character**: After counting the characters, the program compares the values of `ac` and `bc`. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. This logic correctly determines which character appears more frequently in the string.

7. **Output**: The program outputs the result for each test case, which is the character that appears most frequently in the string.

Given the problem description and the requirements, the program correctly handles all aspects of the problem, including input, processing, and output.

Correctness: **True**
