Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` and `m` are the new input integers, `s` is the new input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the new input string `s`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `hmp = Counter(s)` updates the `hmp` variable to be a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the new input string `s`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `p`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial state specifies that `t` is `t - 2`, `n` and `m` are the new input integers, `s` is the new input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', and `ans` is 0. These values are still valid after the code execution.
