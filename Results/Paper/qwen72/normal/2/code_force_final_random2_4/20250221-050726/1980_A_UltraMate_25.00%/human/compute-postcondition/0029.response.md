Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`. `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not a key in `hmp` plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each key `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i] < m`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each key `i` in the `hmp` (Counter) object.
- For each key `i`, if the frequency of the character `i` in `s` (i.e., `hmp[i]`) is less than `m`, the value `m - hmp[i]` is added to `ans`.
- After the loop completes, `ans` will contain the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not a key in `hmp` plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each key `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i] < m`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `p` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
