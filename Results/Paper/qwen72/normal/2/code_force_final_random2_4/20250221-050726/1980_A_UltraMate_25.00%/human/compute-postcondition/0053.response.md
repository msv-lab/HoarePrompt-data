Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s` and must have at least one key, `i` is the next key in `hmp`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not in `hmp` plus `m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.** 

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` increases by the difference `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same. The rest of the initial state remains valid.
