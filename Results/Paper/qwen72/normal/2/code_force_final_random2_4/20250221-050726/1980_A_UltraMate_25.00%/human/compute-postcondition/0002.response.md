The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `m`.

Given the initial state where `t` must be greater than 0, the execution of the code does not affect the value of `t`. However, it introduces new variables `n` and `m`, which are set to the integers provided by the user.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers.**
