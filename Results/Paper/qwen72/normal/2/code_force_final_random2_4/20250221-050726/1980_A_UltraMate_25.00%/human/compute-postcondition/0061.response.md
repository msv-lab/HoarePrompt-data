The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively.

- The initial state mentions that `n` and `m` are input integers, which means they are already defined by user input. However, the new input will overwrite these values.
- The other variables (`t`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`, and `ans`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the updated state after executing the code is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` and `m` are the new input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not in `hmp` plus the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**
