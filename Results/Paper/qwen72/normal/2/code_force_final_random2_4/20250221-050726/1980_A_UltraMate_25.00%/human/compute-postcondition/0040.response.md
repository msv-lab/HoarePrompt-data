Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is 'A'. If `i` ('A') is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
