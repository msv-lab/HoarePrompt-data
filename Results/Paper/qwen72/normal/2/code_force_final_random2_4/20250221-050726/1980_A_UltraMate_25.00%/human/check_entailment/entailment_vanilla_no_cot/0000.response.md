Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly account for all the required difficulty levels ('A' to 'G'). The string `p` used in the program only includes difficulties 'A' to 'F', missing 'G'. This will lead to incorrect results when there are not enough problems of difficulty 'G' in the input string.

To fix this, the string `p` should include all the required difficulty levels:

```python
p = 'ABCDEFG'
```

Additionally, the logic for counting the required problems is correct, but it's important to ensure that all required difficulties are considered. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
            elif hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)
```

With this correction, the program should correctly handle all test cases.
