Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is `t - 2`: This means `t` is updated to `t - 2`, but since `t` is not used in the code snippet, this update does not affect the output.
2. `n` and `m` are new input integers.
3. `s` is a new input string.
4. `p` is the string 'ABCDEF'.
5. `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the new input string `s`.
6. `ans` is initialized as the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not in `hmp`.
7. For each character `i` in `hmp`, if `hmp[i] < m`, `ans` is incremented by `m - hmp[i]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initialization of `ans`**:
   - `ans` is initially set to the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not in `hmp`.
   - If a character from 'ABCDEF' is not in `hmp`, it means that character does not appear in the string `s`, so `ans` is incremented by `m` for each such character.

2. **Incrementing `ans`**:
   - For each character `i` in `hmp` (which contains the frequency of characters in `s`):
     - If `hmp[i] < m`, `ans` is incremented by `m - hmp[i]`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following inputs for clarity:
- `n = 10` (not used in the calculation)
- `m = 3`
- `s = "ABCD"`

#### Step 1: Initialize `hmp`
- `hmp` will be a Counter object: `{'A': 1, 'B': 1, 'C': 1, 'D': 1}`

#### Step 2: Initialize `ans`
- Characters in 'ABCDEF' that are not in `hmp` are 'E' and 'F'.
- Therefore, `ans` is initially set to `m + m = 3 + 3 = 6`.

#### Step 3: Increment `ans`
- For each character in `hmp`:
  - 'A': `hmp['A'] = 1` and `1 < 3`, so `ans` is incremented by `3 - 1 = 2`.
  - 'B': `hmp['B'] = 1` and `1 < 3`, so `ans` is incremented by `3 - 1 = 2`.
  - 'C': `hmp['C'] = 1` and `1 < 3`, so `ans` is incremented by `3 - 1 = 2`.
  - 'D': `hmp['D'] = 1` and `1 < 3`, so `ans` is incremented by `3 - 1 = 2`.

- After these increments, `ans` becomes `6 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 14`.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` after the described calculations.

Output: **14 (where 14 is the value of ans calculated based on the given conditions)**
