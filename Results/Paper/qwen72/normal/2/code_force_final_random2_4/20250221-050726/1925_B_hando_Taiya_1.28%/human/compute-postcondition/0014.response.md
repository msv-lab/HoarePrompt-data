The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value (which is 1) and the value of `i` (which is 2). Since 2 is greater than 1, `ans` is now 2. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer where x >= 1, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 2, `ans` is 2**
