Functionality: ** The function reads two integers, `x` and `n`, from the user input. It then calculates the largest divisor of `x` such that `n` is less than or equal to either `x // i` or `i`, where `i` is a divisor of `x`. If no such divisor exists, the function prints 0. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
