Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer where x >= 1, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 1, and `x` is divisible by `i` without any remainder. If `n` is less than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `i`, `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans` (which was 0) and `i` (which is 1). Otherwise, if `n` is greater than the integer division of `x` by `i`, `ans` is set to `x`.***
