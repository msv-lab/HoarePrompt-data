The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `k - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `k` must still be greater than 2 for the condition `i < k - 1` to hold true.

State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `t` is `2 * t % MOD`, `ans` is the remainder of `ans` divided by `MOD`**
