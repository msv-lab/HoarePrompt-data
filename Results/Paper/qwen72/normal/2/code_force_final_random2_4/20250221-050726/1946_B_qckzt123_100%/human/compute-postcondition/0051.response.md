Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `tmp` is either 0 or the first element in the list `a`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` remains unchanged and must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line and must have at least one element, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the first element in the list `a`. If `tmp` (which is initially `x`) is less than 0, `tmp` is set to 0.***
