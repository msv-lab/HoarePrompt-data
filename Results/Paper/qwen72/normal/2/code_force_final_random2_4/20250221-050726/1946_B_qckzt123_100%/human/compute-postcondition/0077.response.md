The code snippet `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be the remainder of `t` divided by `MOD`. Given the initial state where `t` is already defined as `4 * t % MOD`, this means `t` is already a value that is the remainder of `4 * t` divided by `MOD`. Applying the modulo operation again does not change the value of `t`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state for `t`, while the other variables (`i`, `k`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `t` is `4 * t % MOD`, `ans` is the remainder of `ans` divided by `MOD`**.
