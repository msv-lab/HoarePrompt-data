### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the sum of the array `a` and stores it in `s`.

3. **Maximum Subarray Sum**:
   - The function uses a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum subarray sum that is non-negative. It iterates through the array `a` and updates `tmp` to keep track of the current subarray sum. If `tmp` becomes negative, it resets `tmp` to 0. The variable `t` keeps track of the maximum subarray sum found so far.

4. **Initial Answer Calculation**:
   - The initial answer `ans` is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`. This ensures that the sum of the array plus the maximum subarray sum is taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

5. **Operations Loop**:
   - The function then performs `k-1` operations. In each operation, it doubles the value of `t` and takes the result modulo `10^9 + 7`. It adds this value to `ans` and takes the result modulo `10^9 + 7` again.

6. **Output**:
   - The final answer for each test case is printed.

### Analysis:
- The logic for finding the maximum subarray sum and adjusting the answer through the operations is correct.
- The use of modulo `10^9 + 7` ensures that the results stay within the required range.
- The function handles the constraints and edge cases correctly, including the possibility of negative sums and the need to reset `tmp` to 0 when it becomes negative.
