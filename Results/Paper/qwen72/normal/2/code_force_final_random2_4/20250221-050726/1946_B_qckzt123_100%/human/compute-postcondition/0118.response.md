Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be at least 3, `t` is the remainder of `t * 4` divided by `MOD`, `ans` is the remainder of (`ans` + `t`) divided by `MOD`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The condition that `k` must be at least 3 remains unchanged.
- The value of `t` remains the remainder of `t * 4` divided by `MOD`.
- The value of `ans` is updated to the remainder of (`ans` + `t`) divided by `MOD`. This means `ans` is now the new value after adding `t` to the original `ans` and taking the remainder when divided by `MOD`.
