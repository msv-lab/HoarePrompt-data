Postcondition: ***`i` is `k-2`, `k` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `t` is the maximum of `0` and `tmp`, `ans` is the remainder of (`initial_ans` + `sum of (2^j * initial_t) % MOD` for `j` from 1 to `k-1`) divided by `MOD`, `tmp` is `0` if `tmp` was initially less than 0, otherwise `tmp` remains unchanged, `_` is `0`, `T` is `1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least three elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `x` is the third element in the list `a`.***
