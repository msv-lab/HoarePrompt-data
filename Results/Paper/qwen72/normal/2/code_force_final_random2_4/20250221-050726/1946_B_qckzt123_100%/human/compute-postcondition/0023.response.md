Output State: **`t` is the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in the list `a`, `T` is an integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the last element processed in the list `a`, `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative.**

Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, `t` will hold the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of non-negative sums found in the list `a`. The variable `tmp` will be the sum of the current subarray being considered during the last iteration, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative. The other variables (`T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `s`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
