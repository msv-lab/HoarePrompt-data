Output State: **`t` is the remainder of `t * (2`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` remains unchanged and must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is calculated as the sum of the elements in the list `a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `T`, `n`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
