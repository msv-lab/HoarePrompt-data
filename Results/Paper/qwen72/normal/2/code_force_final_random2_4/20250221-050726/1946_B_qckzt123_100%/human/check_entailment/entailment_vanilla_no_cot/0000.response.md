Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the algorithm updates the value of `t` and `ans` during the loop for `k-1` operations.

1. **Initial Calculation of `t` and `s`:**
   - `s` is the sum of the entire array.
   - `t` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray (Kadane's algorithm).

2. **First Operation:**
   - The initial update of `ans` is correct: `ans = ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.

3. **Subsequent Operations:**
   - The loop for `k-1` operations incorrectly doubles `t` and adds it to `ans` in each iteration. This approach does not correctly simulate the effect of inserting the sum of the subarray multiple times.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, we need to understand that the maximum possible sum after `k` operations is achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum `t` to the total sum `s`. The correct formula for the maximum sum after `k` operations is:

\[ \text{ans} = s + k \cdot t \]

However, since `t` can be zero or negative, we need to handle these cases separately:

- If `t <= 0`, the maximum sum remains `s` because adding a non-positive value does not increase the sum.
- If `t > 0`, the maximum sum is `s + k * t`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import sys

def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, k) = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
        a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
        s = sum(a)
        t = max_subarray_sum(a)
        
        if t <= 0:
            ans = s
        else:
            ans = (s + k * t) % MOD
        
        print(ans)

def max_subarray_sum(a):
    max_ending_here = max_so_far = 0
    for x in a:
        max_ending_here = max(0, max_ending_here + x)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:

1. **max_subarray_sum Function:**
   - This function uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.

2. **Main Function:**
   - Calculate the sum of the array `s`.
   - Calculate the maximum subarray sum `t` using the `max_subarray_sum` function.
   - If `t <= 0`, the maximum sum remains `s`.
   - If `t > 0`, the maximum sum is `s + k * t` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

This corrected approach ensures that the maximum possible sum after `k` operations is calculated correctly.
