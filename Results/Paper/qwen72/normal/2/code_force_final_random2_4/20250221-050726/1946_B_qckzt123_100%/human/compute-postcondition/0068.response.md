The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `t`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t % MOD`, `tmp` is 0 or the sum of the last contiguous subarray of `a` that did not drop below zero, `_` is equal to the length of the list `a`, `T` remains unchanged and must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t`, `i` is 0**
