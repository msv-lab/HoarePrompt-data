### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum back into the array.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, and the result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func()` reads the input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the sum of the array `s` and the maximum subarray sum `t`.
   - The initial maximum sum `ans` is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`.
   - For each subsequent operation, the maximum subarray sum `t` is doubled and added to `ans`, with both `t` and `ans` being taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Key Points:**
   - **Sum Calculation (`s`):** The sum of the array is straightforward and correctly calculated using `sum(a)`.
   - **Maximum Subarray Sum (`t`):** The code uses a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum subarray sum, which is correct. It iterates through the array, maintaining a running sum `tmp` and updating `t` to the maximum value of `tmp`.
   - **Initial Answer Calculation:** The initial answer `ans` is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`, which is correct.
   - **Subsequent Operations:** The code correctly doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` for each operation and adds it to `ans`, taking modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as negative sums and empty subarrays correctly.
   - The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures that the result stays within the required bounds.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity is \(O(n + k)\) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is \(O(1)\) additional space, which is optimal.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and constraints appropriately.
