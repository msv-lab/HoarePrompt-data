You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function operates in an environment where it can interactively query a system to compare bitwise OR results of elements from a hidden permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and it must find a pair of indices (i, j) that maximize the bitwise XOR of the elements at those indices, using at most 3n queries. The function handles multiple test cases, each with a different permutation of size n, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '<':
                mak = i
        
        mak2 = mak
        
        pans = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            s = str(input())
            if s == '<':
                mak = i
                pans = [i]
            elif s == '=':
                pans.append(i)
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(pans)):
            print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '>':
                mak = i
        
        print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: _ is equal to the number of test cases minus 1, `n` is the input positive integer for the last test case, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<`. The loop has completed all its iterations, and the output buffer has been flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates without explicit parameters but interacts with a system to query bitwise OR results of elements from a hidden permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. It aims to find a pair of indices (i, j) that maximize the bitwise XOR of the elements at those indices, using at most 3n queries. The function handles multiple test cases, each with a different permutation of size n, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
