The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all pending output is written immediately. This operation does not alter any of the variables in the current state.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 3, `mak` is 1 if the user input is not `>`, otherwise `mak` is 2, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing at least 4 values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.**
