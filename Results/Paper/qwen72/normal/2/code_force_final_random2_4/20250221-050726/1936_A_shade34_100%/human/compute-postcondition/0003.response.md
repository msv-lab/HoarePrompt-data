The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. Before the loop starts, `_` is 0, `n` is the input positive integer, and `mak` is 0. These values do not directly affect the loop's execution, but `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to run at least once.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak` is 0, `i` is 1**
