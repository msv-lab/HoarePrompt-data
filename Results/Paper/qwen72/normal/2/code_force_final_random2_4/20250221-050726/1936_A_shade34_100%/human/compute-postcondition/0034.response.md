The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `s` is a string input by the user. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is `[0]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0]`. Otherwise, `pans` is an empty list.**
