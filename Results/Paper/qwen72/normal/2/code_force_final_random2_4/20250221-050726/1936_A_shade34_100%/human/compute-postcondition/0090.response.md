Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `mak` is 3, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<`. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called to ensure that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream.**
