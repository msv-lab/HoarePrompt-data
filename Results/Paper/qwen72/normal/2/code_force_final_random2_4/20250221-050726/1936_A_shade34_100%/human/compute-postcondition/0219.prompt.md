Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function operates in an environment where it can interactively query a system to compare bitwise OR results of elements from a hidden permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and it must find a pair of indices (i, j) that maximize the bitwise XOR of the elements at those indices, using at most 3n queries. The function handles multiple test cases, each with a different permutation of size n, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '<':
            mak = i
    mak2 = mak
    pans = []
    for i in range(n):
        print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        s = str(input())
        if s == '<':
            mak = i
            pans = [i]
        elif s == '=':
            pans.append(i)
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, len(pans)):
        print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '>':
            mak = i
    print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is 0, `n` is the input positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<`. The loop has completed all its iterations, and `pans` contains all the indices where the user input was `=` or `<`. The output buffer has been flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 0, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 1, n is a new input positive integer (greater than 0), i is n-1, mak2 is the highest value of i for which the user input was `<`, and pans is a list with at least n elements. If the user input is `>`, then `mak` is set to the index of the last element in `pans` that caused the user input to be `>`. If the user input is not `>`, `mak` retains its original value or the last value it was set to during the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
