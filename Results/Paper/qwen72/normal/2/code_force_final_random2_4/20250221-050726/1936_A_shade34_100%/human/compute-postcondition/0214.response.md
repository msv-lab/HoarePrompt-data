Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is a new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is `n + 1`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is a list with at least `n + 2` elements, `mak` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mak` is updated to be equal to `i`.
- Since `i` is `n + 1`, `mak` now holds the value `n + 1`.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `i`, `mak2`, `pans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
