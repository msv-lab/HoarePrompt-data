Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 1), `i` is 2, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `s` is the new input string. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 2 and `pans` is `[2]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[1, 2]`. For any other value of `s`, `pans` remains `[0]` if it was initially `[0]`, or becomes `[2]` if it was initially an empty list.**
