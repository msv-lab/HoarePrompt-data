The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but not including `n`.

Given that `n` is already stated to be a new input positive integer (greater than 0), for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` is initialized in the loop head as part of the `range(1, n)` and will start at 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 1), `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.**
