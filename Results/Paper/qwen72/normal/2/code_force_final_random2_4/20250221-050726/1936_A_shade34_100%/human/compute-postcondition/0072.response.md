Output State: **_ is 0, `n` is the input positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<`. The loop has completed all its iterations, and `pans` contains all the indices where the user input was `=` or `<`. The output buffer has been flushed.**
