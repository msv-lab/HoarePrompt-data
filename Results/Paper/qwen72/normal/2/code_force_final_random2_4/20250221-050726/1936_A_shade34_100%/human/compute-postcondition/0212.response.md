Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `_` is 1.
2. `n` is a new input positive integer (greater than 0).
3. `i` is `n + 1`.
4. `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
5. `pans` is a list with at least `n + 2` elements.
6. If the user input is `>`, then `mak` is set to `n-1` and subsequently to `n`.
7. If the user input is not `>`, the variables retain their original values.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the value of `mak`:**
   - If the user input is `>`, then `mak` is set to `n-1` and subsequently to `n`.
   - If the user input is not `>`, `mak` retains its original value, which is not specified in the initial state. For the sake of this analysis, let's assume `mak` is initially set to some value, but it will be updated if the user input is `>`.

3. **Determine the values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`:**
   - `pans` is a list with at least `n + 2` elements.
   - `pans[mak]` will depend on the value of `mak`.
   - `pans[i]` will be the element at index `n + 1` in the list `pans`.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **User input is `>`:**
   - `mak` is set to `n-1` and then to `n`.
   - Therefore, `pans[mak]` will be `pans[n]`.
   - `pans[i]` will be `pans[n + 1]`.

2. **User input is not `>`:**
   - `mak` retains its original value (let's assume it is `n` for simplicity).
   - Therefore, `pans[mak]` will be `pans[n]`.
   - `pans[i]` will be `pans[n + 1]`.

### Final Output:
In both scenarios, the values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]` will be the same:
- `pans[mak]` is `pans[n]`.
- `pans[i]` is `pans[n + 1]`.

Thus, the print statement will output:
```
?, pans[n], pans[n], pans[n + 1], pans[n + 1]
```

### Final Answer:
Output: **?, pans[n], pans[n], pans[n + 1], pans[n + 1]** (where `pans[n]` and `pans[n + 1]` are the elements at indices `n` and `n + 1` in the list `pans`, respectively).
