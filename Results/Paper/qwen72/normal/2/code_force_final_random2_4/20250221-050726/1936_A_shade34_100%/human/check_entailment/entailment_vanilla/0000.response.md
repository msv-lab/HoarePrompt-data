### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`, which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Finding the Maximum Bitwise OR:**
   - The variable `mak` is initialized to 0. This variable will store the index of the element that, when ORed with itself, gives the maximum value.
   - A loop iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1`. For each index `i`, it performs a query to compare `(p_mak | p_mak)` with `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the result of the query is `<`, it means `(p_i | p_i)` is greater, so `mak` is updated to `i`.

3. **Finding the Second Maximum Bitwise OR:**
   - The variable `mak2` is set to `mak`. This will help in finding the second maximum value.
   - A list `pans` is initialized to store indices that have the same maximum value as `mak`.
   - Another loop iterates through all indices from 0 to `n-1`. For each index `i`, it performs a query to compare `(p_mak | p_mak2)` with `(p_i | p_mak2)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it means `(p_i | p_mak2)` is greater, so `mak` is updated to `i` and `pans` is reset to `[i]`.
   - If the result is `=`, it means `(p_i | p_mak2)` is equal to `(p_mak | p_mak2)`, so `i` is added to `pans`.

4. **Finding the Maximum XOR:**
   - The variable `mak` is reset to 0. This will store the index of the element that, when XORed with `p_mak2`, gives the maximum value.
   - A loop iterates through the indices in `pans`. For each index `i`, it performs a query to compare `(p_pans[mak] | p_pans[mak])` with `(p_pans[i] | p_pans[i])`.
   - If the result is `>`, it means `(p_pans[i] | p_pans[i])` is greater, so `mak` is updated to `i`.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, the function prints the indices `mak2` and `pans[mak]` as the answer, which are the indices that maximize the XOR value.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly follows the problem's constraints and requirements.
- It uses the allowed number of queries (at most 3n) to find the indices that maximize the XOR value.
- The logic for finding the maximum bitwise OR and the maximum XOR is sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
