To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `_` is 1 (This variable is not used in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).
- `n` is a new input positive integer (greater than 0).
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` is a list with at least 2 elements.
- If the user input is `>`, then `mak` is set to `n-1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(pans) - 1`.
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`.

### Current State:
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `pans` is a list with at least 2 elements.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(pans)`.
- Since `i` is currently `n-1`, for the loop to execute again, `n-1` must be less than `len(pans)`.
- Therefore, `len(pans)` must be greater than `n-1`.

### Updated State:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `n`.
- `len(pans)` must be greater than `n` for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`_` is 1, `n` is a new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is `n`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is a list with at least `n+1` elements. If the user input is `>`, then `mak` is set to `n-1`.**
