The `sys.stdout.flush()` function flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all data written to `sys.stdout` is immediately written to the terminal or file. This operation does not change the values of any variables.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is a new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is a list with at least 2 elements**
