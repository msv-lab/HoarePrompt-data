Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `s` is the string input by the user. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is `[0, 1]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0, 1]`. Otherwise, `pans` is `[1]`.** 

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `pans`. Depending on the initial value of `s`, `pans` was either `[0]` or an empty list. After appending `i`, `pans` becomes `[0, 1]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, and `[1]` if `s` is anything else. All other variables remain unchanged.
