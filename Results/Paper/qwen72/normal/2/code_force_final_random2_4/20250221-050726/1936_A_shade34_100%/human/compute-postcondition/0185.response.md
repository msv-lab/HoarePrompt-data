Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 1, `mak` is 1, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `s` is the user input string, `pans` is `[1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pans = [i]` assigns the list containing the value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `pans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `pans` is now `[1]`.
