The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call forces the output buffer to flush, ensuring that any buffered data is written immediately to the terminal or output stream. However, this does not change the values of any variables or affect the program's state beyond ensuring that any pending output is displayed.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is the input positive integer, `i` is `n`, `mak` is `n-1` if the user input is `>`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 3 elements.**
