Output State: **_ is 0, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.**

### Explanation:
- `_` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` remains the same as it is the input positive integer and is not modified within the loop.
- `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes all iterations because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- `mak` will be the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `mak2` will be the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<` (as per the given code, `mak2` is not updated, so it remains the same as `mak`).
- `pans` will be a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`. If no such inputs were provided, `pans` will remain an empty list.
