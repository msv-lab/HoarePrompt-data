Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is an empty list**.

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all buffered data is written to the output stream immediately. However, this operation does not affect the values of any variables in the current state. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.
