Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is a positive integer (input by the user).
- `i` is `n-1` (the last index of the loop).
- `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`.
- `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
```

### Explanation:
1. **`mak2`**: This is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`. Since `i` starts from `n-1` and decreases, `mak2` will be the largest index where the user input was `<`.

2. **`pans[mak]`**: This is the value at the index `mak` in the list `pans`. `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`. Since `pans` contains all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<`, `pans[mak]` will be the value of `i` where the user input was `>` for the last time.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the exclamation mark followed by the value of `mak2` and the value of `pans[mak]`.

Output: **! [mak2] [pans[mak]] (where mak2 is the last value of i for which the user input was <, and pans[mak] is the value at the index mak in the list pans, where mak is the index of the last element in pans for which the user input was >)**
