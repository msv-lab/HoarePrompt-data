Postcondition: ***`u` is the bit at position 28 in `x`, `v` is the sum of the bits at position 28 in each element of `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, and `i` is 28. If `u` and `v` are both 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.***
