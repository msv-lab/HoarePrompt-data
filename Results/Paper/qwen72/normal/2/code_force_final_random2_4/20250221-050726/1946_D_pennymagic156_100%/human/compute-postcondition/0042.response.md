The code snippet `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise operation on the variable `op`. Specifically, it shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions, then applies a bitwise AND with 1 to get the least significant bit of the shifted value, and finally XORs this result with `op`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element
- `t` is an empty list
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 29
- `u` is 1
- `v` is even
- `op` is 0
- `cnt` is 0

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. `val >> i` shifts the bits of `val` to the right by 29 positions.
2. `val >> i & 1` extracts the least significant bit of the shifted value.
3. `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates `op` by performing an XOR operation with the extracted bit.

Since `i` is 29, the operation `val >> 29` will shift the bits of `val` to the right by 29 positions. This means that only the 30th bit (from the left) of `val` will be considered. The result of `val >> 29 & 1` will be either 0 or 1, depending on whether the 30th bit of `val` is 0 or 1.

Given that `op` is initially 0, the XOR operation `op ^= val >> 29 & 1` will set `op` to the value of the 30th bit of `val`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element
- `t` is an empty list
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 29
- `u` is 1
- `v` is even
- `op` is the 30th bit of `val` (either 0 or 1)
- `cnt` is 0

Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 1, `v` is even, `op` is the 30th bit of `val` (either 0 or 1), `cnt` is 0**
