Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u` is the bit at position 28 in `x`, `v` is the sum of the bits at position 28 in each element of `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0. If `u` and `v` are both 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    ai ^= val
    if not op:
        t.append(ai)
        ai = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 1 element. `val` is the first element in `a`. If `op` is 0, `val` is 0, and `t` is a list that now contains the value of `ai`. `ai` is 0. If `op` is not 0, `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the `i`-th bit of `val`, and the element `ai` in the list `a` is now the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the original value of `ai` and `val`. If `ai` is the first element, it is now 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 2 elements. The first element of `a` is now `a[0] ^ a[1]`. `val` is the second element in `a`. `i` remains unchanged. `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. If `op` is 0 after the update, `t` is a list that now includes the value `0` and `ai` is 0. Otherwise, `t` and `ai` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 3 elements. The first element of `a` is now `a[0] ^ a[1]`. `val` is the third element in `a`. `i` remains unchanged. `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. If `op` is 0 after the update, `ai` is 0 and `t` is a list that now includes the value `0`. Otherwise, `t` and `ai` remain unchanged. `ai` is now `ai ^ val`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
