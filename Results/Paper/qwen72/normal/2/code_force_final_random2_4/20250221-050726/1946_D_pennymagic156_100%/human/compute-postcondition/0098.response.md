Postcondition: ***`u` is 1, `v` is even and non-zero, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `op` is the least significant bit of `val` after shifting it right by 28 positions. If `op` is 0, `cnt` is increased by 1.***
