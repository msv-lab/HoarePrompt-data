Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).**

Explanation: The code snippet `a = func_1()` updates the variable `a` to the value returned by the function `func_1()`. Since the initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), this property remains true after the execution of the code. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged and are still the values returned by `func_3()`.
