To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given State:
- `u` is the bit at position 28 in `x`.
- `v` is the sum of the bits at position 28 in each element of `a`.
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).
- `t` is an empty list.
- `ans` is -1.
- `i` is 28.
- `op` is 0.
- `ai` is 0.
- If `u` and `v` are both 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.

### Loop Head:
```python
for val in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves iterating over the elements of the list `a`.
- For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element.
- The variables `val` and `a` are the only ones directly involved in the loop head.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, `a` must have at least one element.
- The other variables (`u`, `v`, `n`, `x`, `t`, `ans`, `i`, `op`, `ai`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 1 element, `val` is the first element in `a`**.
