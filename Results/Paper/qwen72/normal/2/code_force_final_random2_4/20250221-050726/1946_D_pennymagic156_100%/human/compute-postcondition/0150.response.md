The code snippet `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise operation. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `u` is 1
   - `v` is even and non-zero
   - `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
   - `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element
   - `val` is the first element of `a`
   - `t` is an empty list
   - `ans` is -1
   - `i` is 27
   - `op` is 0
   - `cnt` is 0

2. **Bitwise Operation**:
   - `val >> i` shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions (27 positions).
   - `val >> i & 1` extracts the least significant bit of the result of the right shift.
   - `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise XOR between `op` and the extracted bit.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `op` is updated to the result of the XOR operation.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

4. **Calculation**:
   - Let's assume `val` is the first element of `a`. For example, if `a = [123456789, ...]`, then `val = 123456789`.
   - `val >> 27` shifts `123456789` to the right by 27 positions.
   - The binary representation of `123456789` is `0111010110111100110100010101`.
   - Shifting this right by 27 positions results in `0000000000000000000000000000` (since 27 is more than the number of bits in the integer).
   - `0000000000000000000000000000 & 1` results in `0`.
   - `op ^= 0` does not change `op`, so `op` remains `0`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`u` is 1, `v` is even and non-zero, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element, `val` is the first element of `a`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 0.**
