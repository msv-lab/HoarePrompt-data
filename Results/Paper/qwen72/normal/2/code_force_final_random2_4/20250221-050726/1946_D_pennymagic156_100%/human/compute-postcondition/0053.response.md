Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 1, `v` is even, `op` is the result of the XOR operation between the original `op` and the 30th bit of `val`, `val` is the next element in the list `a`. If `op` is 0, `cnt` is 2; otherwise, `cnt` remains 1.**
