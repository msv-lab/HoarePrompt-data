Output State: **`u` is the bit at position 28 in `x`, `v` is the sum of the bits at position 28 in each element of `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, and `i` is 28.**

Explanation:
- `u` is set to the bit at position 28 in `x` using the expression `x >> i & 1`.
- `v` is set to the sum of the bits at position 28 in each element of `a` using the expression `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`.
- The values of `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
- The list `a` remains a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).
- The list `t` remains empty.
- The variable `ans` remains -1.
- The variable `i` remains 28.
