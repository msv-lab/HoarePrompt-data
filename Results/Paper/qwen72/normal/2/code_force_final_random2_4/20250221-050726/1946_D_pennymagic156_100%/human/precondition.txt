The function `readList` is intended to read input data, but the specific details of the input format and the expected structure of the data (e.g., the number of test cases, the length of the array, the elements of the array) are not provided within the function definition itself. Typically, for the described problem, the input would consist of multiple test cases, each with an integer n and x, followed by a list of n integers.
