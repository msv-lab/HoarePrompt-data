To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the loop head:

```python
for val in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the variable `val` and the list `a`. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. The variable `val` will take on the value of each element in `a` during each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\)
- `t` is an empty list
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 29
- `u` is 1
- `v` is even
- `op` is 0
- `cnt` is 0

We need to ensure that `a` has at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, the state of `a` must be adjusted to ensure it is not empty.

State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 1, `v` is even, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 0**
