To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `val` and the list `a`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves `val` and `a`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the list `a` is not empty.
3. **Initial State**:
   - `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).
   - `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
   - Other variables (`u`, `v`, `t`, `ans`, `i`, `op`, `cnt`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element.
- The initial state already specifies that `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, so we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1.
- The variable `val` will take the value of the first element in `a` when the loop starts.

### Final State:
- `a` must have at least one element.
- `val` will be the first element of `a`.

### State:
**`u` is 1, `v` is even and non-zero, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element, `val` is the first element of `a`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 0.**
