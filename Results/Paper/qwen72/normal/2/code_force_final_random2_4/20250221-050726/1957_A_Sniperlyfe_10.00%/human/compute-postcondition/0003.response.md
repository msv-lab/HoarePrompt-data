The only objects in the loop head are the variable `n` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has more elements, the loop will continue to the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100, `freq` is a dictionary with `n` as a key and 1 as its value, `arr` must have at least 1 element, and `n` is the first element in `arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 2 elements. The next element in `arr` will become the new value of `n`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100, `freq` is a dictionary with the current `n` as a key and 1 as its value, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, `n` is the second element in `arr`**
