Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100, `freq` is a dictionary with the current `n` as a key and 2 as its value, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, `n` is the second element in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code updates the frequency count of `n` in the `freq` dictionary. Since `n` was already a key in the dictionary with a value of 1, the new value of `freq[n]` becomes 2. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
