You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100, `freq` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `arr`.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 4. Each value in `freq` represents the count of how many times an integer appears in the list `arr`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks into a list `arr`.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary `freq`. This is done correctly by iterating over the list `arr` and updating the count for each stick length.

3. **Polygon Formation**: The program aims to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed. A regular polygon requires at least 3 sides, but the program is using `v // 4` to calculate the number of polygons. This implies that the program is assuming each polygon has 4 sides (a square). However, this is incorrect because a regular polygon can have any number of sides greater than or equal to 3.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1(arr)` for each test case. The output is the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 4, which is not the correct approach for determining the maximum number of regular polygons.

Given the above points, the program is incorrect because it assumes all polygons are squares, which is not a valid assumption for the problem statement. The program should consider polygons with any number of sides greater than or equal to 3.

Correctness: **False**
