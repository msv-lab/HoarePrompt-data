### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to reconstruct a palindromic array `a` of length `n` from the given sums of all but one of its subarrays.
   - The array `a` is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards.
   - The input guarantees that there is always at least one valid solution.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: Computes all possible subarray sums of a given array `a` and returns them sorted.
     - This function is used to generate the expected subarray sums for a given array `a`.
   - **func_2**: Filters out consecutive duplicate sums from a list `cts`.
     - This function helps in identifying unique sums, which is crucial for determining the missing sum.
   - **func_3**: Reconstructs the palindromic array `a` from the unique sums `odds` and the length `n`.
     - This function ensures that the reconstructed array is a palindrome.
   - **func_4**: Finds the first non-matching element from the end of two lists.
     - This function is used to identify the missing sum by comparing the generated subarray sums with the given subarray sums.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the subarray sums.
   - It sorts the subarray sums and uses `func_2` to filter out consecutive duplicates.
   - Depending on the number of unique sums, it determines the missing sum using `func_4`.
   - It then reconstructs the palindromic array using `func_3` and prints the result.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and output formats.
   - The logic for finding the missing sum and reconstructing the palindromic array is sound.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are implemented correctly and work together to solve the problem.
