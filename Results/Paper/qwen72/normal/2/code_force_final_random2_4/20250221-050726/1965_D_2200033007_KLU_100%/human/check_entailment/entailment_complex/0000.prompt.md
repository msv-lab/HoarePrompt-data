Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Output

    1 2 1 
    7 2 2 7 
    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of positive integers representing a palindrome array.
def func_1(a):
    cts = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        sm = 0
        
        for j in range(i, len(a)):
            sm = sm + a[j]
            cts.append(sm)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `a` remains a list of positive integers representing a palindrome array, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `j` is not defined (as it is reset in each inner loop iteration), `sm` is not defined (as it is reset in each outer loop iteration), and `cts` is a list containing all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from each index `i` to the end of the array `a`.
    cts.sort()
    return cts
    #The program returns `cts`, which is a sorted list containing all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from each index `i` to the end of the array `a`. Here, `a` is a list of positive integers forming a palindrome array, and `i` is equal to the length of `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers that form a palindrome array. It computes and returns a sorted list of all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from each index `i` to the end of the array `a`. The original list `a` remains unchanged.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cts is a list of integers representing the sums of subarrays of a hidden palindromic array.
def func_2(cts):
    odds = []
    for ct in cts:
        if len(odds) > 0 and ct == odds[-1]:
            odds.pop()
        else:
            odds.append(ct)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `cts` is a list of integers representing the sums of subarrays of a hidden palindromic array, and `odds` is a list of integers where no two consecutive elements are equal. The final `odds` list contains the elements from `cts` that were not removed due to being equal to the last element of `odds` during the loop's execution.
    return odds
    #The program returns the list `odds`, which contains integers from the list `cts` that were not removed because they were equal to the last element of `odds` during the loop's execution. No two consecutive elements in `odds` are equal.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a list `cts` of integers as input and returns a new list `odds`. This list `odds` contains only those integers from `cts` that do not appear consecutively. Specifically, any integer in `cts` that is the same as the last added integer in `odds` is skipped, ensuring that no two consecutive elements in the returned list `odds` are equal.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers representing the sums of odd-indexed subarrays of a palindromic array, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000, and n is the length of the palindromic array to be recovered.
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        
        prev = x
        
        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `a` will contain the reconstructed palindromic array based on the sums of odd-indexed subarrays provided in `odds`. The variable `prev` will be equal to the last element in `odds`, and `idx` will be less than 0 or out of bounds for the array `a`.
    return a
    #The program returns the reconstructed palindromic array `a` based on the sums of odd-indexed subarrays provided in `odds`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `odds`, a list of integers representing the sums of odd-indexed subarrays of a palindromic array, and `n`, an integer indicating the length of the palindromic array to be reconstructed. It returns a list `a` of length `n`, which represents the reconstructed palindromic array based on the sums provided in `odds`. After the function executes, the list `a` contains the elements of the original palindromic array, and the input parameters `odds` and `n` remain unchanged.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: bigList and smallList are lists of integers where the length of bigList is greater than or equal to the length of smallList, and both lists contain at least one element.
def func_4(bigList, smallList):
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        
        smallList.pop()
        
    #State: `bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers where the length of `bigList` is greater than or equal to the length of `smallList`, and both lists contain at least one element, but the last element of `bigList` is no longer equal to the last element of `smallList` (if any remains). The lengths of both `bigList` and `smallList` are reduced such that the remaining elements do not match at the end.
    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of `bigList`, which is an integer and does not match the last element of `smallList` (if any remains).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes two lists of integers, `bigList` and `smallList`, where `bigList` is at least as long as `smallList` and both contain at least one element. It removes matching elements from the end of both lists until either the lists no longer have matching elements at the end or one of the lists becomes empty. The function then returns the last element of `bigList`, which is an integer and does not match the last element of `smallList` (if any remains). If `bigList` becomes empty, the function will raise an IndexError.
