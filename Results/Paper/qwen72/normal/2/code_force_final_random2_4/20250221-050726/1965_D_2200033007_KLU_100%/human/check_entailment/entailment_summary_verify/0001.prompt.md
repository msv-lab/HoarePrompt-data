You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    cts = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        sm = 0
        for j in range(i, len(a)):
            sm = sm + a[j]
            cts.append(sm)
    cts.sort()
    return cts

#Function 2:
def func_2(cts):
    odds = []
    for ct in cts:
        if len(odds) > 0 and ct == odds[-1]:
            odds.pop()
        else:
            odds.append(ct)
    return odds

#Function 3:
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        prev = x
        idx = idx - 1
    return a

#Function 4:
def func_4(bigList, smallList):
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        smallList.pop()
    return bigList[-1]



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_4` takes two lists of integers, `bigList` and `smallList`, where `bigList` is at least as long as `smallList` and both contain at least one element. It removes matching elements from the end of both lists until either the lists no longer have matching elements at the end or one of the lists becomes empty. The function then returns the last element of `bigList`, which is an integer and does not match the last element of `smallList` (if any remains). If `bigList` becomes empty, the function will raise an IndexError.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to recover a palindromic array `a` of length `n` from the given sums of all but one of its subarrays.
   - The array `a` is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards.
   - We are given \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) subarray sums, and we need to find the missing subarray sum to reconstruct the array.

2. **Function Analysis:**

   - **func_1(a):**
     - This function generates all subarray sums of the array `a` and returns them sorted.
     - It iterates through all possible subarrays, calculates their sums, and appends these sums to a list `cts`.
     - Finally, it sorts the list of subarray sums.
     - This function is correct and serves to generate the complete set of subarray sums for a given array `a`.

   - **func_2(cts):**
     - This function identifies the unique subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.
     - It uses a stack-like approach to keep track of sums that appear an odd number of times.
     - If a sum appears twice, it is removed from the list `odds`.
     - The remaining sums in `odds` are the ones that appear an odd number of times.
     - This function is correct and helps identify the unique subarray sums that are crucial for reconstructing the array.

   - **func_3(odds, n):**
     - This function reconstructs the palindromic array `a` using the unique subarray sums.
     - It initializes an array `a` of length `n` with zeros.
     - It iterates through the `odds` list, placing the values in the middle of the array and ensuring symmetry.
     - If the index is the middle of the array, it places the value directly.
     - Otherwise, it places half of the value at the current index and its symmetric position.
     - This function is correct and correctly reconstructs the palindromic array.

   - **func_4(bigList, smallList):**
     - This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the complete list of subarray sums (`bigList`) with the given list of subarray sums (`smallList`).
     - It removes common elements from both lists until it finds the first element that differs.
     - The differing element is the missing subarray sum.
     - This function is correct and effectively finds the missing subarray sum.

3. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The functions work together to solve the problem as described.
   - `func_1` generates the complete set of subarray sums.
   - `func_2` identifies the unique subarray sums.
   - `func_3` reconstructs the palindromic array.
   - `func_4` finds the missing subarray sum.
   - Each function performs its intended task correctly, and the overall logic is sound.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
