Output State: **`odds` must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in `odds`, `idx` is now `idx - 1`, `prev` is now equal to the current value of `x`. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, `a[idx]` is now equal to the current value of `x`. Otherwise, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is now `(x - prev) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is decremented by 1.
- The other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
