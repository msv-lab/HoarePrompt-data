Output State: **`odds` must have at least two elements, `x` is the next element in `odds`, `idx` is now `idx - 1`, `prev` is now equal to the current value of `x`, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is now `(x - prev) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`.
- The values of `odds`, `x`, `idx`, and `prev` remain as described in the initial state.
- The value of `a[n - 1 - idx]` is calculated using the current values of `x` and `prev`, and the result is stored in the array `a` at the index `n - 1 - idx`.
