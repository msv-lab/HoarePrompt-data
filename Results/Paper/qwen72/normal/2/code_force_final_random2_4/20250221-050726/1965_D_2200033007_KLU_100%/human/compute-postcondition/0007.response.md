The last element of `bigList` is removed using the `pop()` method. Since the last element of `bigList` was equal to the last element of `smallList`, and the length of `smallList` is already reduced by 1, the new last element of `bigList` will now be the second-to-last element of the original `bigList`. The length of `bigList` is now one less than its original length, and it remains true that the length of `bigList` is greater than or equal to the length of `smallList`.

Output State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers where the length of `bigList` is greater than or equal to the length of `smallList`, and both lists contain at least one element, and the last element of `bigList` is no longer equal to the last element of `smallList`. The length of `smallList` is reduced by 1, and the length of `bigList` is reduced by 1.**
