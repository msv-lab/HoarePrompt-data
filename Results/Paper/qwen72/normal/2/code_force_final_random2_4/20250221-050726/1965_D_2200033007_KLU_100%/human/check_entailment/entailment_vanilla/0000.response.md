### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to recover a palindromic array `a` of length `n` from the given sums of all but one of its subarrays.
   - The array `a` is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards.
   - We are given \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) subarray sums, and we need to find the missing subarray sum to reconstruct the array.

2. **Function Analysis:**

   - **func_1(a):**
     - This function generates all subarray sums of the array `a` and returns them sorted.
     - It iterates through all possible subarrays, calculates their sums, and appends these sums to a list `cts`.
     - Finally, it sorts the list of subarray sums.
     - This function is correct and serves to generate the complete set of subarray sums for a given array `a`.

   - **func_2(cts):**
     - This function identifies the unique subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.
     - It uses a stack-like approach to keep track of sums that appear an odd number of times.
     - If a sum appears twice, it is removed from the list `odds`.
     - The remaining sums in `odds` are the ones that appear an odd number of times.
     - This function is correct and helps identify the unique subarray sums that are crucial for reconstructing the array.

   - **func_3(odds, n):**
     - This function reconstructs the palindromic array `a` using the unique subarray sums.
     - It initializes an array `a` of length `n` with zeros.
     - It iterates through the `odds` list, placing the values in the middle of the array and ensuring symmetry.
     - If the index is the middle of the array, it places the value directly.
     - Otherwise, it places half of the value at the current index and its symmetric position.
     - This function is correct and correctly reconstructs the palindromic array.

   - **func_4(bigList, smallList):**
     - This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the complete list of subarray sums (`bigList`) with the given list of subarray sums (`smallList`).
     - It removes common elements from both lists until it finds the first element that differs.
     - The differing element is the missing subarray sum.
     - This function is correct and effectively finds the missing subarray sum.

3. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The functions work together to solve the problem as described.
   - `func_1` generates the complete set of subarray sums.
   - `func_2` identifies the unique subarray sums.
   - `func_3` reconstructs the palindromic array.
   - `func_4` finds the missing subarray sum.
   - Each function performs its intended task correctly, and the overall logic is sound.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
