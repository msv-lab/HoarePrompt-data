The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `odds`, which is a list of integers representing the sums of odd-indexed subarrays of a palindromic array, and `n`, which is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000, indicating the length of the palindromic array to be recovered.

After executing the function body, the function returns the reconstructed palindromic array `a` based on the sums of odd-indexed subarrays provided in `odds`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `odds` and an integer `n`, and returns the reconstructed palindromic array `a` of length `n` based on the sums of odd-indexed subarrays provided in `odds`.**
