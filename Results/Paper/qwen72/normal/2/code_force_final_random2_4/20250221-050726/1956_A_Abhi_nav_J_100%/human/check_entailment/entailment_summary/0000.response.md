Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` is supposed to simulate the game described, but it does not perform the necessary steps to remove players according to the rules specified. Instead, it simply checks if `a` is less than or equal to `b` and returns `a - 1` if true, or `b` if false. This logic is fundamentally flawed for several reasons:

1. **Type Mismatch**: `a` is a list of integers, and attempting to compare it directly with `b` (an integer) using `<=` will not work as intended. Similarly, trying to subtract 1 from a list (`a - 1`) will raise a `TypeError`.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The function does not simulate the rounds of the game where players are removed based on the positions specified in `a`. It simply returns a value that does not reflect the game's rules.

3. **Output Mismatch**: The expected output is the number of winners for each `n_i`, but the function does not calculate this correctly.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
