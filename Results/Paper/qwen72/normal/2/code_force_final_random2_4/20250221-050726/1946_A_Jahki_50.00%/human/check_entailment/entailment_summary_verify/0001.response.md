### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`num`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`num2`) and the array itself (`case`).

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The condition `if num2 > 10000` and the subsequent print statements are indeed an unusual edge case and do not align with the problem statement. This is a clear mistake and should be removed.

3. **Array Parsing and Sorting:**
   - The array is parsed from the input string and converted to a list of integers (`a`).
   - The array is then sorted (`b`).

4. **Median Calculation:**
   - The function correctly calculates the index of the median element (`ma`).
   - If the length of the array is even, the median is the element at index `num2 // 2 - 1`.
   - If the length of the array is odd, the median is the element at index `num2 // 2`.

5. **Increasing the Median:**
   - The function initializes the number of operations (`op`) to 0.
   - It enters a loop where it increments the median element until the new median is greater than the original median.
   - After each increment, the array is sorted again to ensure the median is correctly calculated. However, this is inefficient and unnecessary. The function should directly increment the median element and check if it has increased without re-sorting the entire array.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the number of operations required to increase the median.

### Issues:
- **Hardcoded Edge Case:** The condition `if num2 > 10000` and the subsequent print statements are not aligned with the problem statement. This is a mistake and should be removed.
- **Sorting in Each Iteration:** Sorting the array in each iteration of the loop is inefficient. Instead, the function should directly increment the median element and check if it has increased.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for _ in range(num):
        num2 = int(input())
        case = input().strip()
        a = [int(i) for i in case.split()]
        b = sorted(a)
        
        if num2 % 2 == 0:
            ma = num2 // 2 - 1
        else:
            ma = num2 // 2
        
        median = b[ma]
        new_median = median
        op = 0
        
        while new_median <= median:
            b[ma] += 1
            op += 1
            new_median = b[ma]
        
        print(op)
```

### Final Correctness:
The original code has issues with the hardcoded edge case and inefficiency in sorting the array repeatedly. The corrected code addresses these issues and should work correctly according to the problem statement.

Final: **False**
