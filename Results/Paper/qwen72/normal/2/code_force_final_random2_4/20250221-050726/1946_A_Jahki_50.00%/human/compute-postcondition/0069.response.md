The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and `num`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `num` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `num` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, and `op` is 0. If `num2` > 10000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit, `op` is the number of times the loop executed, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` with the element at index `ma` incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b` (now incremented by the number of times the loop executed), and `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b` (which is now equal to `median`).**
