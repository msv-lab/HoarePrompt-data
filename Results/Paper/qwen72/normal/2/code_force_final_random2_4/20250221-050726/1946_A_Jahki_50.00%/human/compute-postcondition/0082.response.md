The code assigns the value of `median` to `new_median`. This operation does not affect the values of any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of integers extracted from the digit strings in `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted version of `a`, `ma` is either `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the value of `b[ma]`, `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]`.**
