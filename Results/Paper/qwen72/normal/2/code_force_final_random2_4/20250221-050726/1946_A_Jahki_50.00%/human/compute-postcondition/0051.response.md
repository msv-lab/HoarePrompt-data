To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while new_median <= median:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will execute if `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`. The relevant variables in the loop head are `new_median` and `median`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `num` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 0
- `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`
- `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd
- `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`
- `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`

Since `new_median` and `median` are both defined as the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`, they are initially equal. Therefore, the condition `new_median <= median` is true, and the loop will execute at least once.

Thus, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`**
