To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `new_median <= median`.

Given the current state:
- `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`.
- `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b` (now incremented by 1).

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `new_median <= median` must still hold true. Since both `new_median` and `median` are derived from the same index `ma` in the sorted list `b`, the only way to ensure the loop condition remains true is to adjust the values of `new_median` and `median` such that `new_median` is still less than or equal to `median`.

However, since the problem specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and the loop head only involves `new_median` and `median`, we need to ensure that `new_median` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `median`.

Since `median` is already defined as the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b` (incremented by 1), and `new_median` is the same element, the only way to ensure the loop condition holds is to keep `new_median` as it is.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary, and the state remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 2, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b` (now incremented by 1), `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`.**
