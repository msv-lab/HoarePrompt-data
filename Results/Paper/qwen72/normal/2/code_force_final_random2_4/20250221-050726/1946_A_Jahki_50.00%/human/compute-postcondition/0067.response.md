To determine what will be printed by the `print(op)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, where each element is a digit.
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `num` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `num2` is an input integer.
- `case` is an input string.
- `op` is the number of times the loop executed.
- `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` with the element at index `ma` incremented by the number of times the loop executed.
- `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd.
- `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b` (now incremented by the number of times the loop executed).
- `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b` (which is now equal to `median`).

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution (`op`):**
   - The variable `op` represents the number of times a loop has executed. This value is not explicitly provided in the initial state, but it is mentioned that `op` is the number of times the loop executed.
   - Since the exact number of loop iterations is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `op`.

2. **Output:**
   - The `print(op)` statement will print the value of `op`, which is the number of times the loop executed.

### Conclusion:
The `print(op)` statement will output the number of times the loop executed. Since the exact number of loop iterations is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe it in general terms.

Output: **op (where op is the number of times the loop executed)**
