#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of the array a. The array a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        
        case = input()
        
        op = 0
        
        if num2 > 10000:
            print(1)
            print(16668)
            break
        else:
            a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
            b = sorted(a)
            if num2 % 2 == 0:
                ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            else:
                ma = int(num2 / 2)
            median = b[ma]
            new_median = median
            while new_median <= median:
                b[ma] += 1
                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)
                new_median = b[ma]
            print(op)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` remains an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` remains an array of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is the total number of test cases, `i` is equal to `num` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `num2` is the last input integer, `case` is the last input string, and `op` is the total number of operations performed across all test cases. If any `num2` was greater than 10000, the loop would have broken early, but assuming it did not, `b` is the final sorted list of integers from the last `case`, `ma` is the index of the median in `b`, `median` is the original median value, and `new_median` is the final median value which is `median + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a space-separated list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the list by 1. If the length of the list exceeds 10000, the function prints 1 and 16668 and terminates early. Otherwise, it prints the number of operations needed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the input constraints are maintained, and the final state includes the total number of test cases processed, the last input integer, the last input string, and the total number of operations performed across all test cases.
