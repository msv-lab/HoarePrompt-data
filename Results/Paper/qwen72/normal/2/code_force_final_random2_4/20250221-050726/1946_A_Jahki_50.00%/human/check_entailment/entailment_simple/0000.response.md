### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`num2`) and the array itself (`a`).

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program includes a condition to handle large arrays (`num2 > 10000`). However, this condition is not aligned with the problem's constraints and seems to be a debugging artifact. It prints a fixed value and breaks the loop, which is incorrect and should be removed.

3. **Median Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the median index (`ma`) based on whether the array length is even or odd.
   - It initializes the median value (`median`) and a new median value (`new_median`) to track changes.

4. **Operation Counting**:
   - The program increments the value at the median index (`b[ma]`) until the new median is greater than the original median.
   - It counts the number of operations required to achieve this and prints the result.

5. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the array after each increment to ensure the median is correctly updated. This is necessary but can be optimized.

6. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the number of operations required for each test case.

### Issues:
- The condition `if num2 > 10000:` is incorrect and should be removed. It breaks the loop and prints fixed values, which is not part of the problem requirements.
- The sorting operation inside the loop can be optimized to avoid unnecessary sorting, but the current approach is still within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct but contains an unnecessary and incorrect edge case handling. Removing the `if num2 > 10000:` block will make the program fully correct.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Suggested Fix:
```python
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        case = input()
        op = 0
        a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
        b = sorted(a)
        if num2 % 2 == 0:
            ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
        else:
            ma = int(num2 / 2)
        median = b[ma]
        new_median = median
        while new_median <= median:
            b[ma] += 1
            op += 1
            b = sorted(b)
            new_median = b[ma]
        print(op)
```

This version removes the incorrect edge case handling and ensures the program works correctly for all valid inputs.
