To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `new_median <= median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`.
- `median` is the value of `b[ma]` where `ma` is calculated based on `num2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `new_median <= median` must still be true. However, since `new_median` is already equal to `b[ma]` and `median` is also `b[ma]`, the condition `new_median <= median` is always true as long as `new_median` remains `b[ma]`.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 2, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` where `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`, `b[ma]` is `median + 1`**
