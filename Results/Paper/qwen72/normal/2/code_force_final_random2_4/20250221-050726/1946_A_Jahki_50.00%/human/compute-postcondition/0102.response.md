The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `a` of integers. Here's the detailed breakdown:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of the array `a`.
  - `a` is an array of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

Given this, the function processes each test case and returns a result for each test case. The specific output is not provided, but typically such functions might return some computed value or property of the array `a` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a result for each test case.**
