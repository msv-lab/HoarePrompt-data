Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the new `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**

Explanation:
- The code `m = s.count('map')` updates the value of `m` to the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The value of `p` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given code snippet.
