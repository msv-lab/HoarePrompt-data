Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the final input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s` for the last test case, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the final `s`.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains the same as it was initially, representing the total number of test cases.
- `i` is now `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration.
- `n` is the input integer for the last test case, representing the length of the string `s` for that test case.
- `s` is the final input string for the last test case, with all occurrences of 'map' removed.
- `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s` for the last test case.
- `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the final `s` for the last test case.
