The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop condition is based on the value of `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit for the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**
