Reasoning:  
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and then removing them from the string. However, this approach is flawed because it only counts and removes "map" before checking for "pie". This means that if "map" and "pie" overlap or are part of a longer sequence, the solution might not correctly identify the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

For example, consider the string "mappie". The current solution would count one "map" and one "pie", leading to a total of 2 deletions. However, the correct answer should be 3 deletions (removing 'm', 'a', and 'p' to avoid both "map" and "pie").

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the minimum number of deletions required to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring. This involves more complex logic, such as using dynamic programming or a sliding window approach to track the positions of these substrings and minimize deletions.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
