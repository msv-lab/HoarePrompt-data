You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        m = s.count('map')
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        p = s.count('pie')
        print(m + p)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. It then counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' in `s`, removes all instances of 'map' from `s`, and counts the occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the modified string. Finally, it prints the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the state includes `t` (the number of test cases), `i` (the index of the last test case processed, which is `t-1`), `n` (the length of the last input string), `s` (the last input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed), `m` (the count of 'map' in the original last input string), and `p` (the count of 'pie' in the modified last input string).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **String Length**: For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the string `s`, although this value is not used in the logic, which is acceptable since the length is only provided for context.
3. **Counting Substrings**: The function counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s`.
4. **Removing Substrings**: It removes all occurrences of "map" from the string `s` using `s.replace('map', '')`.
5. **Counting Remaining Substrings**: After removing "map", it counts the occurrences of "pie" in the modified string.
6. **Output**: The function prints the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie".

However, there is a logical flaw in the approach:
- **Incorrect Handling of Overlapping Substrings**: The function assumes that removing "map" will not affect the count of "pie" and vice versa. This is incorrect because removing "map" might create new "pie" substrings or vice versa.
- **Example**: Consider the string "mappie". Removing "map" results in "pie", which should be counted as one "pie". However, the function will count "map" once and "pie" once, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we handle overlapping substrings correctly. One way to do this is to use a more sophisticated approach, such as iterating through the string and checking for both substrings simultaneously.

Given the current implementation, the program is incorrect due to the handling of overlapping substrings.

Correctness: **False**
