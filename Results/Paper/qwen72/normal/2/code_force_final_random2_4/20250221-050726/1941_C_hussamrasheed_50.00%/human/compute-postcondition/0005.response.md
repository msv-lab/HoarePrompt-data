Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s = s.replace('map', '')` removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' from the string `s`. The variable `m` remains unchanged and still holds the count of how many times 'map' appeared in the original `s`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`) are not affected by this operation.
