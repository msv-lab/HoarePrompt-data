Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a new input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed.
   - `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`.
   - `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(m + p)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `m` represents the count of the substring 'map' in the original string `s`.
   - `p` represents the count of the substring 'pie' in the new string `s` after all occurrences of 'map' have been removed.
   - The print statement will output the sum of these two counts, `m + p`.

Since the exact values of `s`, `m`, and `p` depend on the specific input string `s`, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `m + p` without knowing the input string. However, based on the given information, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **m + p (where m is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original s, and p is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new s after removing all occurrences of 'map')**
