Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Specifically, it only counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and removes them, but it does not account for overlapping occurrences or the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. For example, in the string "mappie", the solution would count one "map" and one "pie" and suggest removing two characters, but the correct answer should be three deletions to remove the overlapping parts.

A correct approach would involve identifying the minimum number of deletions needed to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring in the final string. This might involve more complex logic to handle overlapping cases and ensure the minimum deletions.
