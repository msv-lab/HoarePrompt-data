Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `s`, `m`, and `p`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
