Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually by reading a string `s`.

2. **Single Character String**: If the length of `s` is 1, the program correctly prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange a single-character string to form a different string.

3. **All Characters Identical**: If all characters in `s` are the same and the length of `s` is greater than 1, the program correctly prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange the string to form a different string.

4. **Shuffling**: The program uses `random.sample` to shuffle the characters of `s` and create a new string `s2`. This is a valid approach to generate a different permutation of `s`.

5. **Ensuring Different String**: If the shuffled string `s2` happens to be the same as `s`, the program creates a new string by moving the first character of `s` to the end. This ensures that `s2` is different from `s`.

6. **Output**: The program correctly prints "Yes" followed by the rearranged string `s2` when a valid rearrangement is found.

7. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as single-character strings and strings with all identical characters correctly.

Given the above points, the program appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement and handles all specified cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
