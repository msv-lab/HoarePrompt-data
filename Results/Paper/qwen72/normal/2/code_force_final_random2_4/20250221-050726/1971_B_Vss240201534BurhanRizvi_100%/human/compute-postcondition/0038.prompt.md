Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    if len(s) == 1:
        print('No')
    elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
        print('No')
    else:
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s == s2:
            s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
        print('Yes')
        print(s2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the input string (a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters). If the length of `s` is 1, the program does nothing. If the length of `s` is greater than 1, and all characters in `s` are the same, the program does nothing. Otherwise, if `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is now the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end. If `s` is not equal to `s2`, `s2` remains a randomly shuffled version of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. If `s` has exactly one character, the program does nothing. If `s` has more than one character and all characters are the same, the program also does nothing. Otherwise, `s2` is a shuffled version of `s`. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end of the string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. If `s` has exactly one character, `s` remains unchanged. If `s` has more than one character and all characters are the same, `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s2` is a shuffled version of `s` with the same length and characters. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is the string `s` rotated one position to the left.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
