Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical issue in how it handles the output of "No" and "Yes" responses. Specifically, the program uses `print('No')` instead of `print('NO')` and `print('Yes')` instead of `print('YES')`. According to the problem description, the output should be "NO" and "YES" (in uppercase), but the program outputs these in lowercase, which does not meet the requirements.

Additionally, the program uses `random.sample` to shuffle the string, which could potentially result in the original string being generated again, even though the program attempts to handle this by appending the first character to the end of the rest of the string. However, this approach is not guaranteed to always produce a different string, especially for strings with many repeated characters. For example, if the input string is "aaaab", the program might still generate "aaaab" after shuffling, leading to incorrect output.

To fix these issues, the program should ensure that the output is always in uppercase and that the shuffled string is guaranteed to be different from the original string.
