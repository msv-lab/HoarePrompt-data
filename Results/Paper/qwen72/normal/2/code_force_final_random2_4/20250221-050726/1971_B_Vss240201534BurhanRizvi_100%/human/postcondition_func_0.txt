The function processes a series of inputs where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. For each `s`, if the string has a length of 1 or all characters are the same, the function prints 'No'. Otherwise, it generates a shuffled version of `s` (`s2`). If the shuffled version is identical to `s`, it modifies `s2` by moving the first character to the end. The function then prints 'Yes' followed by the modified or shuffled string `s2`. The function does not return any value.
