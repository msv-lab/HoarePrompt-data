### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This is evident from the loop `for _ in range(int(input())):` which iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

2. **Single Character Case**: If the length of the string `s` is 1, the program correctly prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange a single character string to form a different string. This is handled by the condition `if len(s) == 1:`.

3. **All Characters Identical**: If all characters in the string `s` are the same (i.e., `len(set(s)) == 1`), the program correctly prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange the string to form a different string. This is handled by the condition `elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:`.

4. **Random Rearrangement**: For other cases, the program uses `random.sample` to shuffle the characters of the string `s`. This is a valid approach to generate a random permutation of the string. The line `s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))` ensures that `s2` is a shuffled version of `s`.

5. **Ensuring Different String**: After shuffling, the program checks if the shuffled string `s2` is the same as the original string `s`. If they are the same, it manually creates a different string by moving the first character to the end (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`). This ensures that the resulting string is different from the original string. The line `if s == s2: s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` guarantees that `s2` is not equal to `s`.

6. **Output**: The program correctly prints "Yes" followed by the rearranged string `s2`. This is handled by the lines `print('Yes')` and `print(s2)`.

### Conclusion:
The program handles all edge cases correctly and follows the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
