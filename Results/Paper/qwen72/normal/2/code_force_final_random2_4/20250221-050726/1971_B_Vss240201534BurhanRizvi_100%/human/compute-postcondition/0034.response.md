Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `s2` is a shuffled version of `s` with the same length and characters.
- If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is the string `s` rotated one position to the left.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('Yes')
```

The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`. The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or conditions.

Output: **Yes**
