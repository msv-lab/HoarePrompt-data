Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string (a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters), and the length of `s` is greater than 1. The string `s` contains at least two different characters. `s2` is now the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `s` is a string of length at most 10, containing at least two different characters.
- The code `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` reassigns `s2` to a new string where the first character of `s` is moved to the end.
- For example, if `s` was "abcde", `s2` would become "bcdea".
- The other variables (`t` and `s`) remain unchanged.
