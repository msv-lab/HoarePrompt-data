The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `s` is a string of length 1 consisting of a lowercase English letter. However, these variables (`t` and `s`) are not used in the `print` statement.

Given this information, the `print` statement will simply output the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
