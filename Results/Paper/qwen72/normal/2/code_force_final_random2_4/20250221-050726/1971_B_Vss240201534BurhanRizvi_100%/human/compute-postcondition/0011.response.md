Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string (a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters), and the length of `s` is greater than 1. The string `s` contains at least two different characters. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is now the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end. Otherwise, `s2` remains a randomly shuffled version of `s`.***
