The initial state specifies that `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, and `s2` is a shuffled version of `s`. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end of the string.

Given this, the `print('Yes')` statement does not depend on the values of `s` or `s2`. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
