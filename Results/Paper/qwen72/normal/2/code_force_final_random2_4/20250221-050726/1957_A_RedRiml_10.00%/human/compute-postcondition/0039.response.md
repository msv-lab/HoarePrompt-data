Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least `ln` elements, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`, `shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each unique element `j` in the list `pl`.
- For each `j`, it checks if the count of `j` in `palka` (stored in `d[j]`) is greater than or equal to 3.
- If the condition is met, `shapes` is incremented by 1.
- After all iterations, `shapes` will contain the total number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `d`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
