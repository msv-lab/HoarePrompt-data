To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in palka:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `palka`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute if `palka` is not empty. If `palka` is empty, the loop will not run even once.
3. **Initial State**: We need to ensure that `palka` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`palka`**: It must contain at least one integer.
- **`i`**: This variable will take the value of the first element in `palka` when the loop starts.

### Final State:
The state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `palka` is not empty and `i` is set to the first element of `palka`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `i` is the first element in `palka`**
