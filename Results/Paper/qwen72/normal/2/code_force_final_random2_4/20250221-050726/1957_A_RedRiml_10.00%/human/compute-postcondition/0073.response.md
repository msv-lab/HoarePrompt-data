The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `pl`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `pl`. If `pl` has at least two elements, the loop can execute again for the second element in `pl`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was the first element in `pl`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `pl` must have at least two elements, and `j` should now be the second element in `pl`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` and must have at least two elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`, `j` is the second element in `pl`. If `d[j]` is at least 3, `shapes` is set to 1. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.**
