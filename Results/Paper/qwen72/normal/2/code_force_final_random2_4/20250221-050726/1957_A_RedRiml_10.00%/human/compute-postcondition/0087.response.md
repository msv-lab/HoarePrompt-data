To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object `palka`, as it is the only object in the loop head (`for i in palka:`). The loop will execute if `palka` is a non-empty list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100
- `w` is greater than 2
- `_` is 2
- `ln` is an input integer
- `palka` is a list of integers read from input
- `pl` is an empty list
- `d` is an empty dictionary
- `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`

For the loop to execute, `palka` must be a non-empty list. Therefore, we need to ensure that `palka` contains at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must contain at least one element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`**
