The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. This means that the count of the integer `i` (which is the third element of the list `palka`) in the dictionary `d` is increased by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least two elements, `pl` is a list, `d` is a dictionary, `i` is the third element of `palka`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1, `shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.**
