Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must contain at least one element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` is None, then `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1. `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`. Additionally, `i` is a key that exists in the dictionary `d` with a non-None value. The current value of `i` is not in the list `pl`.**
