Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must contain at least one element, `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the integer `i`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is incremented by 1 if it already exists or set to 1 if it does not, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, and `i` is a key that exists in the dictionary `d` with a non-None value. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `i` is added to `pl`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must contain at least two elements, `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the integer `i`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is incremented by 1 if it already exists or set to 1 if it does not, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, and `i` is the next element in `palka` that exists in the dictionary `d` with a non-None value. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `i` is added to `pl`. The list `pl` now includes the integer `i` if it was not already present.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must contain at least three elements, `pl` is a list that now definitely contains the integer `i` (the third element in `palka` that exists in the dictionary `d` with a non-None value), `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either set to 1 or incremented by 1 depending on whether `i` was already in `d`, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, and `i` is the third element in `palka` that exists in the dictionary `d` with a non-None value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
