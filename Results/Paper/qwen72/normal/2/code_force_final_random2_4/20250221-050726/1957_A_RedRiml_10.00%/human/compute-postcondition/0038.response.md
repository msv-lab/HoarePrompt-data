Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least `ln` elements, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` and must have at least 3 elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`, `j` is the third element in `pl`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, then `shapes` is set to 2. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.***
