The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Here's the updated state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100
- `w` must be greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `ln` is an input integer
- `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 2 elements
- `pl` is a list that may contain the first element of `palka`
- `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` (the first element in `palka`)
- If `i` was not already in `pl`, `i` is added to `pl` and the value of `d[i]` is now 1 (initially 0, then incremented by 1). If `i` was already in `pl`, `pl` remains unchanged and the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 2 elements, `pl` is a list that may contain the first element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` (the first element in `palka`), and the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**
