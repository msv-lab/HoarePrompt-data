Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input binary string with a length of 2 to 500 characters, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `s[j]` (the third character of `s`) is different from `s[j + 1]` (the fourth character of `s`), then `j` is 3, `count` is 2 or 3 depending on whether `s[2]` (the third character of `s`) is different from `s[3]` (the fourth character of `s`), and `flag` is True if `s[2]` is '0' and `s[3]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False. If `s[j]` is the same as `s[j + 1]`, then `j` remains 2, `count` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[j]` (the first character of `s`) is different from `s[j + 1]` (the second character of `s`), and `flag` is True if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False.***
