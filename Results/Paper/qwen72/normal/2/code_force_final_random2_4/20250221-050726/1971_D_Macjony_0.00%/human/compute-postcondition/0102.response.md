Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which specifies the number of binary strings to process. For each of the `t` binary strings provided as input, the function calculates and prints the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string, adjusting the count by subtracting 1 if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1'. After processing all `t` strings, the function completes without returning any value. The final state includes the last processed binary string `s` and the original value of `t`, with the loop index `i` set to `t - 1` and the position index `j` set to `len(s) - 1`. **
