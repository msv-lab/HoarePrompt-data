You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a single parameter, `s`, which is a binary string (a string consisting of characters '0' and '1') with a length of 1 to 500 characters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `s` will be the last input binary string provided, with a length of 2 to 500 characters. The variable `t` will be the same as the initial input value, indicating the total number of iterations. The loop index `i` will be equal to `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration. The variable `j` will be equal to `len(s) - 1`, reflecting the last position checked in the string `s`. The variable `count` will represent the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `s`, adjusted by decrementing by 1 if there was at least one transition from '0' to '1' (`flag` is True). If there were no such transitions, `count` will remain unchanged and `flag` will be False.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a single parameter `s`, which is a binary string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500 characters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
