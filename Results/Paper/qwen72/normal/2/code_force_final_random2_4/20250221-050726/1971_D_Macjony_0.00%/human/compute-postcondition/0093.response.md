Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input binary string with a length of 3 to 500 characters, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2 or 3, `count` is 1 or 2, and `flag` is False or True. If `s[j]` is different from `s[j + 1]`, then `j` is incremented to 3 and `flag` is set to True. Otherwise, the values of `j` and `flag` remain unchanged.***
