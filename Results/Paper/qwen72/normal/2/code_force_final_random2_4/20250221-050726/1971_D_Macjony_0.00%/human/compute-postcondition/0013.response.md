Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input binary string with a length of 2 to 500 characters, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `count` is 1. If `s[j]` (the first character of `s`) is different from `s[j + 1]` (the second character of `s`), then `count` is updated to 2. If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `flag` is set to True and `j` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains False and `j` remains 0.***
