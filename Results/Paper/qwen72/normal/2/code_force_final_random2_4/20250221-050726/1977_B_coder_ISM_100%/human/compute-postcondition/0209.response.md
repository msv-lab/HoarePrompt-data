The code snippet `s[i] = '1'` changes the value of the element at index `i` in the list `s` to `'1'`. Given that `i` is 2, the element at index 2 in the list `s` is set to `'1'`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the corresponding bit in `x`, except `s[2]` is now '1', and `flag` remains unchanged.**
