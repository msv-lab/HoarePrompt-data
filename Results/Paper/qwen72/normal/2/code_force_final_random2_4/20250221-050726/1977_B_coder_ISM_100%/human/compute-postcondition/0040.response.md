The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` updates the value of the element at index `i` in the list `s` to `'-1'`. Given the initial state, the only change is to the value of `s[i]`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, where each element is either '1', '0', or now `-1` at index 1, `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions.**
