The code snippet `s[i - 1] = '-1'` updates the element at index `i - 1` in the list `s` to be `'-1'`. Given that `i` is 31, the index being updated is `31 - 1`, which is 30. Therefore, the 30th element of `s` is set to `'-1'`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 31, `i` is 31, `s` is a list containing 30 (or 31) elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. The 30th element of `s` is now '-1', the 29th element of `s` is '-1', the 28th element of `s` remains '1', the 27th element of `s` is '-1', and the 31st element of `s` is now '0'.**
