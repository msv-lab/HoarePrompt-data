Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 1, and `s` is a list containing either `['1', '1']` or `['0', '1']` if the bit at position 0 in `x` is set (i.e., 1). If the bit at position 0 in `x` is 0, `s` is a list containing either `['1', '0']` or `['0', '0']`.***
