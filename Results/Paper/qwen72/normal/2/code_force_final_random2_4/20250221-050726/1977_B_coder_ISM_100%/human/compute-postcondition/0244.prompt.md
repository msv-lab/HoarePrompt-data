Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ x < 2^30, t is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 31, `i` is 31, `s` is a list containing 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. The loop has processed all elements from index 1 to 30, and any occurrences of a '-1' followed by a '1' have been replaced such that the '-1' becomes '0' and the '1' remains '1'. The final state of `s` will reflect these changes, with the last element being potentially modified based on the conditions described.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30 or 31, `i` is `length - 1`, and `s` is a list of 30 or 31 elements representing the binary form of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB). Any consecutive '1's have been replaced with '-1' followed by '1', and any '0's encountered while `flag` is 1 have been flipped to '1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is changed to '1' and `flag` remains 1. If `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not '0', then `length` is 30, `s` has 30 elements, and `flag` is 0. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` is 31, `s` has 31 elements, `s[29]` is '0', and `s[30]` is '1'. All occurrences of `-1` followed by `1` in the list `s` have been replaced with `0` followed by `-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 29, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. The list `s` will have been processed such that any occurrence of `-1` followed by `1` will result in the `-1` moving one position to the left and the `1` becoming `0`. This process will continue through the entire list up to the 29th index. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', the 29th element of `s` (`s[29]`) is now '1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', `length` is 31, and `s` is a list containing 31 elements where the last element is '0'. If `flag` is 0, `length` remains 30 and the last element of `s` is not '0'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
