Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 29, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. The elements of `s` have been modified according to the rules of the loop: if two consecutive elements were '1', the first one was changed to '-1' and `flag` was set to 1. If `flag` was 1 and the current element was '0', it was changed to '1' and `flag` was reset to 0. Otherwise, the elements remained unchanged. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', `s[29]` is now '1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', `length` is 31, `s` has 31 elements, `s[29]` remains as it was, and `s[30]` is '1'. If `flag` is 0, `s[29]` is not '0'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30 (or 31), `i` is 29, `s` is a list containing 30 (or 31) elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If the 29th element of `s` is '-1' and the 28th element of `s` is '1', then the 29th element of `s` is now '0', the 28th element of `s` remains '1', and the 27th element of `s` is now '-1'. Otherwise, the elements of `s` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 31, `i` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 (or 31) elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If the 30th element of `s` is '-1' and the 29th element of `s` is '1', then the 30th element of `s` is now '0', the 29th element of `s` is '-1', the 28th element of `s` remains '1', and the 27th element of `s` is '-1'. Otherwise, the elements of `s` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 31, `i` is 31, `s` is a list containing 30 (or 31) elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If the 31st element of `s` is '-1' and the 30th element of `s` is '1', then the 30th element of `s` is now '-1', the 29th element of `s` is '-1', the 28th element of `s` remains '1', the 27th element of `s` is '-1', and the 31st element of `s` is now '0'. Otherwise, the list `s` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
