Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 29, `s` is a list of 31 elements representing the binary form of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB), with any consecutive '1's replaced with '-1' followed by '1', and any '0's encountered while `flag` is 1 flipped to '1'. The final state of `s` reflects these changes, and `s[29]` is now '0'. The last element `s[30]` is '1'. `flag` is currently 1.**
