The code snippet `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the list `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing the string '1'. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 4 is non-zero, `s` now contains the strings '1' and '1'. Otherwise, `s` now contains the strings '0' and '1'.**
