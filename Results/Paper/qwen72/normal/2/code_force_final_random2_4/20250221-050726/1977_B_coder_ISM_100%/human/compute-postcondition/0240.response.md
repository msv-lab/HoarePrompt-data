Postcondition: ***`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 3, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `s[2]` is '-1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[1]` is now '-1' and `s[2]` is '0'. Otherwise, the list `s` remains unchanged except that `s[2]` is now '0'. `s[1]` (which is `s[i - 1]`) is now '-1'. `flag` is either 1 or 0, and `length` is 30 or 31 depending on the value of `flag` and the last element of `s`.***
