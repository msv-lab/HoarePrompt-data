### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, reading the value of `x`.

2. **Binary Representation**: The function converts the integer `x` into its binary representation by checking each bit from 0 to 29. This is done using the bitwise AND operation (`x & pow(2, i)`). The binary representation is stored in the list `s` as a sequence of '1's and '0's.

3. **Handling Consecutive Non-Zero Bits**: The function processes the binary string to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero bits are present. It uses a flag to track whether a carry-over needs to be applied. If a '1' is followed by another '1', it changes the first '1' to '-1' and sets the flag to 1, indicating a carry-over. The flag is used to adjust subsequent bits accordingly.

4. **Final Adjustments**: After processing the entire string, the function checks if there is a remaining carry-over (flag is set) and adjusts the last bit or appends an additional bit if necessary. Specifically:
   - If the flag is set and the last bit is '0', it changes the last bit to '1'.
   - If the flag is set and the last bit is not '0', it sets the last bit to '0' and appends an additional '1' to the list, increasing the length by 1.

5. **Post-Processing Adjustments**: The function performs a final pass to ensure that any `-1` followed by `1` is adjusted correctly. This ensures that the final array meets the requirement of no two consecutive non-zero bits.

6. **Output**: The function prints the length of the resulting array and the array itself.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Binary Conversion**: The binary conversion is correct and ensures that the array `s` contains '1' for each set bit in `x` and '0' otherwise.
- **Consecutive Non-Zero Bits Handling**: The logic for handling consecutive non-zero bits is correct. It ensures that no two consecutive non-zero bits are present by converting the first '1' to '-1' and setting a carry-over flag.
- **Carry-Over Handling**: The carry-over logic is correctly implemented, ensuring that the final array meets the requirement of no two consecutive non-zero bits.
- **Post-Processing Adjustments**: The post-processing adjustments ensure that any `-1` followed by `1` is correctly handled, maintaining the constraint of no two consecutive non-zero bits.
- **Output Length**: The length of the array is correctly calculated and printed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and constraints. It generates a valid array for the given integer `x` and ensures that no two consecutive non-zero bits are present.
