To determine what will be printed by the `print(*s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the transformations applied to the list `s`.

### Initial State:
- `x` is an input integer.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `nalla` is 1.
- `length` is either 30 or 31.
- `i` is `length - 1`.
- `s` is a list of 30 or 31 elements representing the binary form of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).

### Transformations:
1. **Consecutive '1's Replacement**: Any consecutive '1's in `s` have been replaced with '-1' followed by '1'.
2. **Flipping '0's**: Any '0's encountered while `flag` is 1 have been flipped to '1'.
3. **Special Case for `s[29]`**:
   - If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is changed to '1' and `flag` remains 1.
   - If `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not '0', then `length` is 30, `s` has 30 elements, and `flag` is 0.
   - If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` is 31, `s` has 31 elements, `s[29]` is '0', and `s[30]` is '1'.
4. **Final Replacement**: All occurrences of `-1` followed by `1` in the list `s` have been replaced with `0` followed by `-1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Binary Representation**: The list `s` initially contains the binary representation of `x` from LSB to MSB.
2. **Consecutive '1's Replacement**: This step ensures that any sequence of consecutive '1's is transformed into a pattern of `-1` followed by `1`.
3. **Flipping '0's**: While `flag` is 1, any '0' encountered is flipped to '1'.
4. **Special Case for `s[29]`**:
   - If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', it is changed to '1', and `length` becomes 31.
   - Otherwise, `length` remains 30.
5. **Final Replacement**: The pattern `-1` followed by `1` is replaced with `0` followed by `-1`.

### Final Output:
Given the transformations, the final list `s` will contain the modified binary representation of `x` with the specified replacements. The exact values depend on the initial value of `x` and the transformations applied.

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the transformations applied.

Output: **The modified binary representation of `x` with the specified transformations applied, where the length of the list `s` is either 30 or 31 depending on the conditions described.**

For example, if `x` is such that the transformations result in a specific pattern, the output might look like:
- If `length` is 30: `0 1 0 -1 1 0 1 ...`
- If `length` is 31: `0 1 0 -1 1 0 1 0 1 ...`

However, without the exact value of `x`, the precise output cannot be determined numerically. The output will be the list `s` after all the transformations are applied.
