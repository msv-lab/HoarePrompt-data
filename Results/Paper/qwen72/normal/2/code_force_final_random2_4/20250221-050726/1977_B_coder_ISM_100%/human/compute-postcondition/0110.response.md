Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB), and `flag` is 0. Either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.***
