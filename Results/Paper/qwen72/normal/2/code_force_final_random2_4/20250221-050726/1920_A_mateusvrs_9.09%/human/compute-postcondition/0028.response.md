The code `bx = max(x, bx)` updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the current value of `bx`. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `_` remains 1.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `a` remains an input integer.
- `x` remains an input integer.
- `ax` remains 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or not 2, otherwise it remains the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.
- `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and its original value.
- `cx` remains an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise it contains `x`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the original value of `bx`, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` contains `x`.**
