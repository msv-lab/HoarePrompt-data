Functionality: ** The function reads a series of test cases, each containing a number of constraints represented by pairs (a, x). For each test case, it calculates a result based on the constraints: it finds the maximum value of x for constraints of type 1 (bx), the minimum value of x for constraints of type 2 (ax), and a set of unique x values for constraints of type 3 (cx). If bx is greater than or equal to ax, the result for that test case is 0. Otherwise, the result is the count of valid x values in cx (those between bx and ax, inclusive) subtracted from the total possible values (ax - bx + 1). The function prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line. **
