Postcondition: ***_ is n-1, n is the input integer, t is greater than 0, a and x are integers provided by user input, cx is a set containing at least two unique x values where a was neither 1 nor 2, ax is the minimum value of all x values where a was 2, bx is the maximum value of all x values where a was 1, i is the next value from the set cx. If i is within the range [bx, ax], tmp is 3. Otherwise, tmp is 2.***
