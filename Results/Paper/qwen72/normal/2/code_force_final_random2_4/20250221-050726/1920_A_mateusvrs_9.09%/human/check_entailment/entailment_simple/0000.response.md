Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes an empty list `r` to store the results of each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes `cx` as a set to store the values of `x` for constraints of type 3.
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large value (initially set to \(10^9 + 7\)) to represent the minimum upper bound and `bx` to a very small value (initially set to -1) to represent the maximum lower bound.
   - It iterates through each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), it updates `bx` to the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), it updates `ax` to the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (k must be not equal to x), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, it means there is no valid integer `k` that satisfies all constraints, so it appends 0 to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the number of invalid values (those in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`) from the total possible values (`ax - bx + 1`).

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results stored in `r`, each on a new line.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem description. The only potential issue is the initial value of `ax` being set to \(10^9 + 7\), which is slightly larger than the maximum possible value of `x` (which is \(10^9\)). However, this does not affect the correctness of the program because the minimum operation will still correctly update `ax` to the smallest valid upper bound.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
