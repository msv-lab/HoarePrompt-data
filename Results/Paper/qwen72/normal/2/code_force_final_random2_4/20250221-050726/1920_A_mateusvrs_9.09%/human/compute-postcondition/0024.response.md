Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1 if `a` is not 1, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 2, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1 if `a` is not 1, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` contains `x`.***
