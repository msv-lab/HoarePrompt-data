The code snippet `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the collection `cx`. This operation modifies the collection `cx` by including `x` as one of its elements. The values of `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged, but the state of `cx` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` now includes `x` as one of its elements. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and its previous value. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the initial value of `ax`. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `x` has been added to the collection `cx`.**
