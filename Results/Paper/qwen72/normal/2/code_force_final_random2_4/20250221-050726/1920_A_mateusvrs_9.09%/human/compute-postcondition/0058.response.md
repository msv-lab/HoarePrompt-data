The code snippet `a, x = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `a` and `x`. The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 0, but this state is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input.**
