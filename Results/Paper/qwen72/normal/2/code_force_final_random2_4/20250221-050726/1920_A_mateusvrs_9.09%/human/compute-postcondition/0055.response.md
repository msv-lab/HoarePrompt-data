Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `_` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is an empty set, if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` now includes an additional element `0`. Otherwise, if `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, and `r` contains one additional element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**

Explanation:
- `ax` is updated to the value of `int(1000000000.0 + 7)`, which evaluates to `1000000007`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `bx`, `cx`, and `r`) retain their previous conditions and values as specified in the initial state.
