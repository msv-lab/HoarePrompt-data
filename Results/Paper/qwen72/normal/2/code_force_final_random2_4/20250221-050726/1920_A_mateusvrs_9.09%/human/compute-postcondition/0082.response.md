Output State: **After all iterations, `n` is 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 2. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` contains all unique `x` values encountered where `a` was neither 1 nor 2.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, decrementing `n` each time until it reaches 0.
- For each iteration, `a` and `x` are read from user input.
- If `a` is 1, `bx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
- If `a` is 2, `ax` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
- If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `x` is added to the set `cx`.
- After all iterations, `n` will be 0, and the final values of `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` will reflect the operations performed during the loop.
