The code snippet `a, x = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `a` and `x`.

- `a` and `x` are now assigned new values from the input.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**
