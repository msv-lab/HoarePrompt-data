Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` contains `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is not equal to 1, and `a` is not equal to 2**

Explanation:
- The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`.
- The set `cx` was initially empty, so now it contains the value of `x`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, `a`, `x`) remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
