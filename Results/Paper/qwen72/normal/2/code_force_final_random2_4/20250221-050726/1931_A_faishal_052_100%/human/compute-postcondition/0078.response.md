Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [0, 26] if it was initially between 52 and 78, `info` is updated based on the initial value of `lex`, `arr` is `[1, 26]` if `lex` is less than 28, `[26, 26]` if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive) or between 52 and 78 (inclusive), and `[26]` if `lex` is greater than 78, `lex` is now `lex - 26`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `lex` is reduced by 26.
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `info`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `lex` is `lex - 26`.
- The conditions for `arr` and `info` based on the initial value of `lex` remain valid, but the new value of `lex` should be considered for any further operations.
