The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range limit `3`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` being less than `3`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` is incremented from 0 to 1.
- The condition `j < 3` must still hold true for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `lex` is the last input integer processed, `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, `temp` is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[2][0] + 96`.**
