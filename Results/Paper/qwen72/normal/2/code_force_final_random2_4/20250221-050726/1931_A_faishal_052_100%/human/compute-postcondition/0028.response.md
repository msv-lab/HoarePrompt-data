Postcondition: ***`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `lex` is less than 52, `lex` is reduced by 26, and `arr` is updated as follows: if the original `lex` was less than 28, `arr` is [1, 26]; if the original `lex` was between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is [26, 26]; if the original `lex` was greater than 51 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is [26, 26]; if the original `lex` was greater than 78, `arr` remains [26]. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` remains [26] and `lex` is unchanged.***
