Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `lex` is `lex - 1`, `info` is [[1, 1, 1, lex - 4]], `arr` is [1], and `lex` is less than 27.**

Explanation:
- The value of `lex` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `lex` is `lex - 1`.
- Since `lex` was originally less than 28, after decrementing by 1, `lex` is now less than 27.
- The value of `lex - 3` in the `info` list is also updated to `lex - 4` because `lex` has been decremented.
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `info`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
