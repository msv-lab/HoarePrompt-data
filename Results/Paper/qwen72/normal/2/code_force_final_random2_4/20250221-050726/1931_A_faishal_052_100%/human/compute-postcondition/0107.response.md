The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value `26` to the list `arr`. Let's consider the different cases based on the initial state:

1. If `lex` < 28, `arr` was initially `[1]`. After appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[1, 26]`.
2. If `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52, `arr` was initially `[26]`. After appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[26, 26]`.
3. If `lex` >= 52, `arr` was initially `[]`. After appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[26]`.

The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, `lex`, and `info` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` < 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex - 1]]` and `arr` is `[1, 26]`. If `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex + 26]]` and `arr` is `[26, 26]`. If `lex` >= 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex]]` and `arr` is `[26]`.**
