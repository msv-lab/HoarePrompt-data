To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for j in range(2):
```

The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and the loop will execute as long as `range(2)` generates a sequence of numbers. The `range(2)` function will always generate the sequence `[0, 1]`, which means the loop will always execute twice regardless of the initial value of `j`.

Given this, the initial state of `j` does not need to be adjusted because the loop will execute regardless of its initial value. However, for clarity and to ensure the loop executes as intended, we can set `j` to 0, which is the starting point of the `range(2)` sequence.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `lex` is an input integer, `info` is [[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]] if `lex` is less than 28; `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]] if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive); `info` is [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]] if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive) or greater than 78, `arr` is an empty list.**
