Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading the encoded integer `lex`.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program attempts to decode the integer `lex` into a 3-letter word by distributing the value among three positions.
   - It uses a loop to handle the distribution, but the logic is flawed:
     - If `lex < 28`, it appends 1 to the array and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex < 52`, it appends 26 to the array and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex <= 78`, it appends 26 to the array and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - This logic does not correctly distribute the values to ensure the lexicographically smallest word. For example, if `lex` is 24, the program will append `[1, 1, 22]` instead of `[1, 1, 22]` which should be `[1, 1, 22]` (which is correct but not the smallest).

3. **Sorting and Output**:
   - After appending the values, the program sorts the array, which is necessary to ensure the lexicographically smallest word.
   - It then converts the values to characters and prints the result.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `lex` is 3 (which should result in "aaa") and when `lex` is 78 (which should result in "zzz").

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program's logic for distributing the values is incorrect. It should distribute the values in a way that ensures the smallest possible values are used first.
   - For example, for `lex = 24`, the correct distribution should be `[1, 1, 22]` (which corresponds to "aav"), but the program might incorrectly distribute it as `[1, 1, 22]`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is not correct because it does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word.

Correctness: **False**
