The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value `26` to the list `arr`. We need to consider the different cases for `lex` and how they affect `arr` and `info`.

### Initial State:
- `cases` must be at least 2
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 2
- If `lex` < 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex - 1]]` and `arr` is `[1, 1]`.
- If `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex + 25]]` and `arr` is `[26, 1]`.
- If `lex` >= 52, `lex` is adjusted based on the initial value of `lex`:
  - If the original `lex` was less than 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 27]]` and `arr` is `[1, 26]`.
  - If the original `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26 + 26]]` and `arr` is `[26, 26]`.
  - If the original `lex` was 52 or greater, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26]]` and `arr` is `[26]`.
  - If the original `lex` was greater than 78, `lex` remains unchanged, and `info` and `arr` retain their initial values as specified in the precondition.

### Impact of the Code:
- `arr.append(26)` adds `26` to the end of the list `arr`.

### Calculation of the Result:
- For each case, we need to append `26` to the existing `arr`.

#### Case 1: `lex` < 28
- Initial `arr` is `[1, 1]`.
- After appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[1, 1, 26]`.

#### Case 2: `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52
- Initial `arr` is `[26, 1]`.
- After appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[26, 1, 26]`.

#### Case 3: `lex` >= 52 and original `lex` < 28
- Initial `arr` is `[1, 26]`.
- After appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[1, 26, 26]`.

#### Case 4: `lex` >= 52 and original `lex` between 28 and 52 (inclusive)
- Initial `arr` is `[26, 26]`.
- After appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[26, 26, 26]`.

#### Case 5: `lex` >= 52 and original `lex` 52 or greater
- Initial `arr` is `[26]`.
- After appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[26, 26]`.

#### Case 6: `lex` > 78
- `lex` remains unchanged, and `info` and `arr` retain their initial values.
- If the initial `arr` was `[1, 1]`, it becomes `[1, 1, 26]`.
- If the initial `arr` was `[26, 1]`, it becomes `[26, 1, 26]`.
- If the initial `arr` was `[1, 26]`, it becomes `[1, 26, 26]`.
- If the initial `arr` was `[26, 26]`, it becomes `[26, 26, 26]`.
- If the initial `arr` was `[26]`, it becomes `[26, 26]`.

### Output State:
- `cases` must be at least 2
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 2
- If `lex` < 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex - 1]]` and `arr` is `[1, 1, 26]`.
- If `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex + 25]]` and `arr` is `[26, 1, 26]`.
- If `lex` >= 52 and original `lex` < 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 27]]` and `arr` is `[1, 26, 26]`.
- If `lex` >= 52 and original `lex` between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26 + 26]]` and `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]`.
- If `lex` >= 52 and original `lex` 52 or greater, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26]]` and `arr` is `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` > 78, `lex` remains unchanged, and `info` and `arr` retain their initial values as specified in the precondition, with `arr` being updated to `[1, 1, 26]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, `[1, 26, 26]`, `[26, 26, 26]`, or `[26, 26]` depending on the initial `arr`.

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `info` and `lex` retain their initial values, and `arr` is updated to `[1, 1, 26]` if `lex` < 28, `[26, 1, 26]` if `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52, `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` >= 52 and original `lex` < 28, `[26, 26, 26]` if `lex` >= 52 and original `lex` between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `[26, 26]` if `lex` >= 52 and original `lex` 52 or greater, and retains its initial value with the addition of `26` if `lex` > 78.**
