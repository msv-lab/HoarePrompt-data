Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `lex` is an input integer, `info` is [[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]], `arr` is [1], and `lex` is less than 28.**

The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` was an empty list, so after executing the code, `arr` contains the single element `1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
