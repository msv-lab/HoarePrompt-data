The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `cases` must be at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `cases` must still be at least 1.

State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` is an input integer, `info` is [[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]] if `lex` is less than 28; `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]] if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive); `info` is [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]] if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive) or greater than 78.**
