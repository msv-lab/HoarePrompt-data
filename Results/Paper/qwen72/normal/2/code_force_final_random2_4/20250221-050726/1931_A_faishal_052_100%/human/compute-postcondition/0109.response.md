The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `info`, and `arr`) remain unchanged. The specific values of `info` and `arr` depend on the initial value of `lex`.

- If `lex` was initially less than 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex - 1]]` and `arr` is `[1, 26]`.
- If `lex` was initially between 28 (inclusive) and 52 (exclusive), `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex + 26]]` and `arr` is `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` was initially 52 or greater, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex]]` and `arr` is `[26]`.

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `lex` is `lex - 26`, `info` and `arr` retain their initial values based on the initial `lex` conditions.**
