Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `lex` is the last input integer processed, `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, `temp` is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[2][0] + 96`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `temp` is updated to include the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[2][0] + 96`.
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `lex`, `info`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
