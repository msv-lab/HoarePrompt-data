Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle the generation of the lexicographically smallest word for all cases. Specifically, the logic used to distribute the values among the three letters is flawed. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Distribution Logic**: The code uses a fixed set of conditions to decide how to distribute the value `lex` among the three letters. However, these conditions do not always result in the lexicographically smallest word. For example, the condition `if lex < 28:` and `elif lex < 52:` are not sufficient to ensure the smallest possible letters are chosen.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases well. For instance, when `lex` is very small (e.g., 3), the code should directly assign the smallest possible values to the letters, but it doesn't handle this efficiently.

3. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array after assigning values can lead to incorrect results because it may change the order of the letters, which is crucial for lexicographical order.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Initialize the three letters with the smallest possible values
        a, b, c = 1, 1, 1
        remaining = lex - 3  # Subtract the initial values of 'a', 'b', and 'c'
        
        # Distribute the remaining value to make the sum equal to lex
        while remaining > 0:
            if remaining >= 26:
                c += 26
                remaining -= 26
            elif remaining >= 1:
                c += remaining
                remaining = 0
        
        # Ensure the letters are in the correct order
        while c > 26:
            c -= 26
            b += 26
        while b > 26:
            b -= 26
            a += 26
        
        # Convert the indices to letters
        result = chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96)
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the letters are distributed in such a way that the resulting word is lexicographically smallest. It handles the distribution of the remaining value and ensures that the letters are within the valid range (1 to 26).
