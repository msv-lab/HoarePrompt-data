Postcondition: ***`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` < 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex - 1]]` and `arr` is `[1]`. If `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex + 26]]` and `arr` is `[26]`. If `lex` >= 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex]]` and `arr` is `[]`.***
