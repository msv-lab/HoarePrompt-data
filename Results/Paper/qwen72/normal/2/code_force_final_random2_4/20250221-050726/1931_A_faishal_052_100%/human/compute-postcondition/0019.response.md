Postcondition: ***`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is [1]. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is [26]. If `lex` is greater than 51, `arr` is an empty list if `lex` is greater than 78, otherwise `arr` is [26].***
