Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is [1, 1, 1] and `lex` is `lex - 3`. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is [26, 1, 1] and `lex` is `lex - 27`. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is [26, 26, 26] and `lex` is `lex - 78`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is [26, 26, 26] and `lex` is `lex - 78`.**

### Explanation:
- **If `lex` is less than 28:** The loop appends `1` to `arr` three times, and `lex` is decremented by 1 each time, resulting in `arr` being `[1, 1, 1]` and `lex` being `lex - 3`.
- **If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive):** The loop appends `26` to `arr` once, then `1` twice, and `lex` is decremented by 26 initially and by 1 twice, resulting in `arr` being `[26, 1, 1]` and `lex` being `lex - 27`.
- **If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive):** The loop appends `26` to `arr` three times, and `lex` is decremented by 26 each time, resulting in `arr` being `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` being `lex - 78`.
- **If `lex` is greater than 78:** The loop appends `26` to `arr` three times, and `lex` is decremented by 26 each time, resulting in `arr` being `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` being `lex - 78`.

The loop runs exactly 2 times, so `j` is 2 after the loop completes. The variable `i` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
