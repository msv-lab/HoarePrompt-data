Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `lex` is `lex - 26`, `info` is [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]] if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is [26], and `lex` is greater than or equal to 26 and less than or equal to 52.** 

Explanation: The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. Since the initial condition specifies that `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), after subtracting 26, `lex` will now be between 26 and 52 (inclusive). All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
