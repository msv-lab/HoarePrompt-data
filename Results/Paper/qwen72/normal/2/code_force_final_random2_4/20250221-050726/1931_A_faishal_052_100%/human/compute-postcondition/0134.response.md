The code snippet updates the `temp` variable by appending a character to it. This character is determined by converting the integer value found at `info[i][j]` to its corresponding lowercase letter (by adding 96 to the integer value and converting it to a character using `chr()`). The initial state specifies that `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, so the value used is `info[0][2]`.

Given the initial state:
- `cases` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 2
- `lex` is the last input integer processed
- `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs
- `temp` is an empty string

After executing the code:
- `temp` is updated to contain the character corresponding to the value of `info[0][2]` converted to a lowercase letter.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `lex` is the last input integer processed, `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, `temp` is the character corresponding to `info[0][2]` converted to a lowercase letter.**
