Postcondition: ***`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `lex` is greater than or equal to 52. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `info` is [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]], and `arr` is [26]. If `lex` is greater than 78, `info` remains [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]], and `arr` remains an empty list. In both cases, `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [26, 52] if it was initially between 52 and 78.***
