Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin where the first line is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines each containing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word. `cases` is assigned the value of the integer input from the first line. `info` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cases):
    arr = []
    lex = int(input())
    for j in range(2):
        if lex < 28:
            arr.append(1)
            lex = lex - 1
        elif lex < 52:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
        elif lex <= 78:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
    arr.append(lex)
    arr.sort()
    info.append(arr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `lex` is an input integer, `info` is [[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]] if `lex` is less than 28; `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]] if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive); `info` is [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]] if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive) or greater than 78.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` remains unchanged, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex]]`, `arr` is `[lex]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` < 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 80], [lex - 2], [1, 1, 1, lex]]` and `arr` is `[1, 1, 1, lex]`. If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 80], [lex + 24], [1, 1, 26, lex]]` and `arr` is `[1, 1, 26, lex]`. If `lex` is 52 or greater and originally between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 25 + 26], [1, 26, 26, lex]]` and `arr` is `[1, 26, 26, lex]`. If `lex` is 52 or greater and originally 52 or greater, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 27], [1, 26, lex]]` and `arr` is `[1, 26, lex]`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `lex` remains unchanged, and `info` and `arr` retain their initial values as specified in the precondition, with `info` being `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 80], [lex + 24], [1, 1, 26, lex]]` or `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 27], [1, 26, lex]]` depending on the original value of `lex`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
