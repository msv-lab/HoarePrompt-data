The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. Let's consider the different cases for `lex`:

- If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` was initially `[1]`.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` was initially `[26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` was initially `[26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` was initially an empty list `[]`.

After executing `arr.append(26)`, the value 26 is added to the list `arr` in each case. Therefore, the updated values of `arr` are:

- If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` becomes `[1, 26]`.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` becomes `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` becomes `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` becomes `[26]`.

The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, and `lex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer, `arr` is [1, 26] if `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is [26, 26] if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive) or if `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is [26] if `lex` is greater than 78.**
