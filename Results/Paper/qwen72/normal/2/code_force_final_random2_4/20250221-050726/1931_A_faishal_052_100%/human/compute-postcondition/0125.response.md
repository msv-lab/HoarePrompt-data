Postcondition: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2. If `lex` < 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 80], [lex - 2]]` and `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]`. If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 80], [lex + 24]]` and `arr` is `[26, 1, 1]`. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 27]]` and `arr` is `[1, 26, 1]`. If `lex` is 52 or greater and originally between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 25 + 26]]` and `arr` is `[26, 26, 1]`. If `lex` is 52 or greater and originally 52 or greater, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 105], [lex - 27]]` and `arr` is `[26, 1]`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `lex` remains unchanged, and `info` and `arr` retain their initial values as specified in the precondition. If `lex` is 28 or greater but less than 52, `lex` is reduced by 26, and `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex + 25]]` and `arr` is `[26, 1]`. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `lex` is reduced by 26, and `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26]]` and `arr` is `[26]`. If `lex` is 78 or greater, `lex` remains unchanged, and `info` and `arr` retain their initial values as specified in the precondition.**
