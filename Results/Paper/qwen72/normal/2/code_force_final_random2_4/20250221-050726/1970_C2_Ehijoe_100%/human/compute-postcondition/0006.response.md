The code snippet `nodes[u].append(v)` adds the integer `v` to the list of adjacent nodes for the node `u` in the `nodes` defaultdict. This operation modifies the `nodes` dictionary but does not affect any other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer input by the user, `nodes` is a defaultdict where `nodes[u]` now includes `v` in its list of adjacent nodes, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user.**
