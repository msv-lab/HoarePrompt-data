To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the loop head:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `range(n - 1)` generates at least one value. This means `n - 1` must be greater than 0, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than 1.
3. **Initial State of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, as it is the starting point of the `range` function.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n`**: Ensure that `n` is greater than 1.
- **`i`**: Set `i` to 0.

### Final State:
The final state after adjusting the necessary variables for the loop to execute is:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer input by the user, `nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing adjacent nodes, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True**
