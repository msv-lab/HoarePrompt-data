Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and an integer `t` from user input, constructs a graph represented by a dictionary `nodes` where each key is a node and its value is a list of adjacent nodes, identifies leaf nodes (nodes with only one connection), reads a starting node `start` from user input, and calls another function `func_1` with the graph and the starting node. Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `t` are the integers input by the user, `nodes` is a dictionary representing the graph, `start` is the starting node input by the user, `leaves` is a deque containing all leaf nodes, and `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`. **
