Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer input by the user, `t` is an integer input by the user, `nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing adjacent nodes, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    nodes[u].append(v)
    nodes[v].append(u)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer input by the user, `nodes` is a defaultdict where `nodes[u]` now includes `v` in its list of adjacent nodes and `nodes[v]` now includes `u` in its list of adjacent nodes, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer input by the user, `nodes` is a defaultdict where `nodes[u]` now includes `v` in its list of adjacent nodes and `nodes[v]` now includes `u` in its list of adjacent nodes, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user, `nodes[u]` now includes `v` in its list of adjacent nodes, and `nodes[v]` now includes `u` in its list of adjacent nodes.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer input by the user, `nodes` is a defaultdict where `nodes[u]` now includes `v` in its list of adjacent nodes and `nodes[v]` now includes `u` in its list of adjacent nodes, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user, `nodes[u]` now includes `v` in its list of adjacent nodes, and `nodes[v]` now includes `u` in its list of adjacent nodes, `u` and `v` are updated to new integers provided by the user, and `nodes[u]` now includes another `v` in its list of adjacent nodes, and `nodes[v]` now includes `u` in its list of adjacent nodes again.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
