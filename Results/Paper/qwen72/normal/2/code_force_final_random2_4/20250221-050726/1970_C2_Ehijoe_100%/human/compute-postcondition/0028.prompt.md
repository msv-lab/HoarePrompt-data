Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer input by the user, `t` is an integer input by the user, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key (representing a node) has a list of integers (representing adjacent nodes) based on the inputs provided during the loop, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is `n-1`, `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers provided by the user, `leaves` is an empty deque.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        leaves.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer input by the user, `t` is an integer input by the user, `nodes` is a defaultdict with at least one key-value pair, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is `n-1`, `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers provided by the user, `leaves` is a deque. If the length of the list associated with `key` in the `nodes` dictionary is 1, `leaves` contains the first key from the `nodes` dictionary. Otherwise, `leaves` remains empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer input by the user, `t` is an integer input by the user, `nodes` is a defaultdict with at least two key-value pairs, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is `n-1`, `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers provided by the user. If the length of the list associated with the new `key` in the `nodes` dictionary is 1, `leaves` is a deque containing the new key from the `nodes` dictionary. Otherwise, `leaves` remains empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer input by the user, `t` is an integer input by the user, `nodes` is a defaultdict with at least one key-value pair remaining, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is `n-1`, `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers provided by the user, `key` is the next key in the `nodes` dictionary. If the length of the list associated with the new `key` in the `nodes` dictionary is 1, `leaves` is a deque containing the new key from the `nodes` dictionary. Otherwise, `leaves` remains empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
