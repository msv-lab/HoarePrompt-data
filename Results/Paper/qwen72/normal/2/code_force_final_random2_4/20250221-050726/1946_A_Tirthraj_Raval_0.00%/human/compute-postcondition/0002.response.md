The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The initial state provided indicates that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute if `t` is within this range. However, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 0**
