Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.** 

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `a` to be a list of integers input by the user. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `p`, `res`) remain unchanged. The new value of `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
