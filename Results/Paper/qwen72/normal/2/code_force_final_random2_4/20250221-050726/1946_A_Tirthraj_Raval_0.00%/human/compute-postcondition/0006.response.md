The value of `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. This means `p` is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2, minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.**
