Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The value of `p` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `p` is calculated based on the current value of `n`. The rest of the initial state remains valid.
