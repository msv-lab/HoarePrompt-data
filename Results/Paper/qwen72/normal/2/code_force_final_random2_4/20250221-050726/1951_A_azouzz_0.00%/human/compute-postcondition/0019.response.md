Output State: **start and end are integers where start <= end, `t` must be greater than 0 (but one less than before), `_` is a placeholder (no specific state), `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the condition is met. Otherwise, `cnt1` is either less than or equal to 2, or `cnt1` is odd. If '11' is in `s`, the string `s` contains the substring '11'. Otherwise, the substring '11' is not present in `s`.**
