To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`.
- `t` is greater than 0 (but one less than before).
- `_` is a placeholder (no specific state).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is a new input string.
- `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.

### Conditions:
1. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the condition is met.
2. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and odd, or if `cnt1` is 1, the condition is also met.
3. Otherwise, `cnt1` is either less than or equal to 2, or `cnt1` is even.
4. If '11' is in the new value of `s`, the string `s` contains the substring '11'.
5. Otherwise, the substring '11' is not present in `s`.

### Analysis:
- The `print('YES')` statement is executed unconditionally, meaning it does not depend on any of the conditions mentioned above.
- The conditions provided are used to determine the state of the program, but they do not affect the execution of the `print` statement itself.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `cnt1`.

Output: **YES**
