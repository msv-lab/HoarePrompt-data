The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. It then evaluates the string `s` based on the count of '1' characters and the presence of the substring '11'. If the count of '1' is greater than 2 and even, or if the count is 2 or less, it prints 'YES'. If the count of '1' is greater than 2 and odd, or if the substring '11' is present in `s`, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify any external state or variables outside its scope.
