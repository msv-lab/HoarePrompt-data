Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0 (but one less than before), `_` is a placeholder (no specific state), `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string. If `cnt1` (the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`) is greater than 2 and even, the condition is met. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and odd, or if `cnt1` is 1, the condition is also met. Otherwise, `cnt1` is either less than or equal to 2, or `cnt1` is even. If '11' is in the new value of `s`, the string `s` contains the substring '11'. Otherwise, the substring '11' is not present in `s`.**
