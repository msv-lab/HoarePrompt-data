Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is a placeholder (no specific state).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string.
- `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.
- `cnt1` is either less than or equal to 2, or `cnt1` is even.
- The substring '11' is not present in `s`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`. The conditions described do not affect the content of the `print` statement itself, as they are only constraints on the input and state of the program.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **YES**
