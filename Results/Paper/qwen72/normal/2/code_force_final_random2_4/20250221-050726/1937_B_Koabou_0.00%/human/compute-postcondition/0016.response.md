Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is an empty list if the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is not met. If the condition is met, `s` is the string formed by concatenating the first character of the first string in `a` with the entire second string in `a`, `x` is 0, `i` is 0, the second character of the first string in `a` is '1', and the first character of the second string in `a` is '0'. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the condition is met.***
