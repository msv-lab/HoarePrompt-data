The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to indicate that the loop will run a fixed number of times (in this case, twice). Since the loop is set to execute exactly twice, the state of `_` is not something we need to explicitly track or adjust. The loop will execute the specified number of times regardless of the value of `_`.

Given that the loop will execute exactly twice, and we are at the end of the first iteration, the loop will automatically proceed to the second iteration without any adjustments needed to the loop control variable.

Therefore, the state remains the same except for the implicit understanding that the loop counter (represented by `_`) has incremented internally to prepare for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, the loop will execute exactly once more.**
