The code snippet `a.append(input())` appends a new input string to the list `a`. Since `a` initially contains three input strings, after executing this code, `a` will contain four input strings. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing four input strings, the loop will execute exactly once more.**
