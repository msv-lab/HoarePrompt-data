The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly within its definition but is expected to process a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5) and two binary strings `a1` and `a2`, each of length `n` and composed of 0s and 1s. The function processes these inputs across up to `t` test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), where the total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and two binary strings `a1` and `a2` of length `n`. It returns a result for each test case based on the processing of these inputs.**
