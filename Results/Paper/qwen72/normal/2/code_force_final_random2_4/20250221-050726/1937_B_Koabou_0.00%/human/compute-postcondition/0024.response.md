Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `i` is 2, the second character of the first string in `a` is '1', the first character of the second string in `a` is '0', `s` is "ab1ef", and `x` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to 2, which is the value of `i`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
