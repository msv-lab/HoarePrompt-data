Postcondition: ***`t` must be at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \). If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]` and `j` remains 0. Otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` and `j` remains 0.***
