The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then calculates a list `ans` containing specific values derived from `k` and all powers of 2 up to `1 << 19`, excluding one particular power of 2. The function prints the length of this list and the list itself for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the state includes the initial value of `t`, the last processed values of `n` and `k`, and the final value of `i` which is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \) for the last test case.
