Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \).**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to increment `i` as long as \( 1 << (i + 1) \leq k \).
- This means that the loop will stop when \( 1 << (i + 1) > k \), which implies that \( 1 << i \leq k \) but \( 1 << (i + 1) > k \).
- Therefore, the final value of `i` will be the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \).

In simpler terms, `i` will be the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`. For example, if `k` is 15, the loop will stop when `i` is 3 because \( 1 << 3 = 8 \) and \( 1 << 4 = 16 \), which is greater than 15.
