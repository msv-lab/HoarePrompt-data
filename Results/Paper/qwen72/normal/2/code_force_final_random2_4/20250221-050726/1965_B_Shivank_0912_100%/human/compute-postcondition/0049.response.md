Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is at least 2.
2. `tc` is 1.
3. `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \).
4. `j` is 19.
5. `n` is an input integer.
6. `k` is an input integer and must be at least \( 2^i \).

### List `ans` Construction:
- The list `ans` is constructed as follows:
  - It starts with the elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
  - It is then followed by the powers of 2 from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19`, excluding `1 << i`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `i`**:
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \).
   - For example, if `k = 10`, then \( 1 << 3 = 8 \) and \( 1 << 4 = 16 \). Therefore, `i = 3`.

2. **Construct the initial part of `ans`**:
   - `k - (1 << i)`: If `k = 10` and `i = 3`, then \( 10 - 8 = 2 \).
   - `k + 1`: If `k = 10`, then \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).
   - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: If `k = 10` and `i = 3`, then \( 10 + 1 + 8 = 19 \).
   - So, the initial part of `ans` is `[2, 11, 19]`.

3. **Construct the remaining part of `ans`**:
   - The powers of 2 from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19` are: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288]`.
   - Exclude `1 << i` from this list. If `i = 3`, exclude `8` from the list.
   - The remaining list is: `[1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288]`.

4. **Combine the parts**:
   - The final list `ans` is: `[2, 11, 19, 1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288]`.

### Print Statement Execution:
- The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 11 19 1 2 4 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288**
