To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The variables involved in the loop condition are `i` and `k`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `k` is an input integer and must be at least 2.

3. **Condition Evaluation:**
   - The condition `1 << i + 1 <= k` needs to be true for the loop to execute again.
   - Substituting the current value of `i` (which is 1):
     - `1 << (1 + 1) = 1 << 2 = 4`
   - Therefore, the condition becomes `4 <= k`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 4.
   - The current state specifies that `k` must be at least 2, but for the loop to continue, `k` must be at least 4.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`t`, `tc`, `j`, `n`, `ans`) are not directly involved in the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the state of `k` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is at least 4.

State: **`t` must be at least 2, `tc` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 19, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 4, `ans` contains the initial elements `[k - (1 << 0), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << 0)]` followed by all powers of 2 from `1` to `1 << 19` except for `1 << 0`**
