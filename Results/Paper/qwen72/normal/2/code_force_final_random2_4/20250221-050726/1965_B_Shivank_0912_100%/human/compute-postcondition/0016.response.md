The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 20. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \). If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]` and `j` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` and `j` is 1.**
