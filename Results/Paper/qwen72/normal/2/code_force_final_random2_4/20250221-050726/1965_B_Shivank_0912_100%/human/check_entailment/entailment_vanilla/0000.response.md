Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
   - No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
   - For every integer `v` in the range `[1, n]` excluding `k`, there is a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Approach in the Given Program**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It then finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` using a loop.
   - It constructs the sequence `ans` with three specific elements: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.
   - It appends all powers of 2 (except `1 << i`) up to `2^19` to the sequence `ans`.

3. **Analysis of the Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence `ans` includes `k - (1 << i)`, which ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k` because `k - (1 << i)` is less than `k` and the other elements are carefully chosen to avoid forming `k`.
   - The elements `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` are included to ensure that the sequence can form sums greater than `k`.
   - The powers of 2 (excluding `1 << i`) are included to ensure that the sequence can form any sum in the range `[1, n]` except `k`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The sequence `ans` is constructed to have at most 25 elements, which satisfies the problem's constraint.
   - The sequence avoids forming a subsequence that sums to `k` by carefully choosing the elements.
   - The sequence can form any sum in the range `[1, n]` except `k` due to the inclusion of powers of 2 and the specific elements.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
