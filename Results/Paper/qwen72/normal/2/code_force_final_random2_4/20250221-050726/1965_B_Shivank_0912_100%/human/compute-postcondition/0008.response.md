To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The variables in the loop condition are `i` and `k`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `k` must be greater than or equal to 4.

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `1 << i + 1 <= k`.
   - Substituting the current value of `i` (which is 3):
     - `1 << 3 + 1` = `1 << 4` = 16.
   - Therefore, the condition becomes `16 <= k`.

4. **Determine the Requirement for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `16 <= k` must be true.
   - Given that `k` must be greater than or equal to 4, this does not guarantee that `k` is at least 16.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `k` must be at least 16.

### Conclusion:
The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `k` is at least 16.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `i` is 3, and `k` must be at least 16**.
