To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The variables in the loop condition are `i` and `k`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `k` is an input integer.

3. **Condition Evaluation:**
   - The condition `1 << i + 1 <= k` needs to be true for the loop to execute.
   - Substituting `i = 0` into the condition:
     - `1 << (0 + 1) <= k` simplifies to `1 << 1 <= k`, which is `2 <= k`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be at least 2.

### Conclusion:
The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `k` to ensure that the loop condition `1 << i + 1 <= k` is true when `i` is 0. Therefore, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.

### Final State:
State: **`t` must be at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `i` is 0, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2**.
