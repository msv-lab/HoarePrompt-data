The value of `j` is 2, and the operation `1 << j` shifts the binary representation of 1 two places to the left, resulting in the value 4. This value is appended to the list `ans`.

If `j` is not equal to `i`, the initial state of `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2]`. After appending `1 << j`, the new state of `ans` becomes `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4]`.

If `j` is equal to `i`, the initial state of `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 2]`. After appending `1 << j`, the new state of `ans` becomes `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 2, 4]`.

The values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \), `j` is 2, and `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4]` if `j` is not equal to `i`, otherwise `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 2, 4]`.**
