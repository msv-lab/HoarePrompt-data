Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`) if all inputs were `<`, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, `prev` is 0, `i` is 1, `r` is the user input.**

The code snippet `r = input()` assigns the user input to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
