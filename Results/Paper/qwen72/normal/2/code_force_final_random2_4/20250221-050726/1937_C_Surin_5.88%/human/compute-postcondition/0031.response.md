Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `kp` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`) if all inputs were `<`, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`.
   - `prev` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1`: This variable depends on the inputs. If all inputs were `<`, then `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`.
   - `i`: This is explicitly given as 1.
   - `prev`: This is explicitly given as 0.

4. **Possible Scenarios for `v1`:**
   - If all inputs were `<`, then `v1` is `n-1`.
   - If not all inputs were `<`, then `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`.

Since the exact sequence of inputs is not provided, we need to consider both scenarios:

- **Scenario 1: All inputs were `<`**
  - `v1` = `n-1`
  - The print statement becomes:
    ```python
    print(f'? {n-1} {1} {n-1} {0}')
    ```
  - Output: **? n-1 1 n-1 0**

- **Scenario 2: Not all inputs were `<`**
  - `v1` = the last value of `i` where the input was `<`
  - The print statement becomes:
    ```python
    print(f'? {last_value_of_i_where_input_was_<} {1} {last_value_of_i_where_input_was_<} {0}')
    ```
  - Output: **? last_value_of_i_where_input_was_< 1 last_value_of_i_where_input_was_< 0**

Since the exact value of `v1` depends on the inputs, we need to provide a general answer that covers both scenarios.

Output: **? v1 1 v1 0 (where v1 is the last value of i where the input was <, or n-1 if all inputs were <)**
