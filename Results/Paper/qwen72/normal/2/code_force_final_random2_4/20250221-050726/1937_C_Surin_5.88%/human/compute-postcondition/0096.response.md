Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is 3, `r` is the user input, and `prev` is 0 or 2 depending on the user input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `r = input()` updates the value of `r` to the user input. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `r` while keeping the rest of the variables in their initial state.
