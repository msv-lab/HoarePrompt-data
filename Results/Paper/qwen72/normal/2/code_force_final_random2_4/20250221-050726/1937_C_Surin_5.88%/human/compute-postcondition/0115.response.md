Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 2, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`, `v2` is 2, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is set to 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `v2 = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `v2`.
- All other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `prev`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
