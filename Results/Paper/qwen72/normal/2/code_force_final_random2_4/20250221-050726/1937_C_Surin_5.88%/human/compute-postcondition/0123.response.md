Based on the initial state provided:

- `kp` is 2
- `n` is greater than 3
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is 0
- `i` is 3
- `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`
- `v2` is 3
- `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Let's break down the values of the variables used in the print statement:
- `v1` is 0
- `v2` is 3

So, the print statement will substitute these values into the string:
```python
print(f'? {0} {0} {3} {3}')
```

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 3 3**
