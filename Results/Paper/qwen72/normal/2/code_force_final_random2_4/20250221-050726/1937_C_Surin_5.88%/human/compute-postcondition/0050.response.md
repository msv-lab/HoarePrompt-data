To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `kp` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`) if all inputs were `<`, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `prev` is the last index where the input was `>`. If no input was `>`, `prev` is 0.
   - `v1` is the last index where the input was `<`. If all inputs were `<`, `v1` is `n-1`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
   ```

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If no input was `>`, `prev` will be 0.
   - If all inputs were `<`, `v1` will be `n-1`.
   - If there were both `<` and `>` inputs, `prev` will be the last index where the input was `>`, and `v1` will be the last index where the input was `<`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be a string in the format `! {prev} {v1}`.
   - `prev` will be 0 if no input was `>`, otherwise it will be the last index where the input was `>`.
   - `v1` will be `n-1` if all inputs were `<`, otherwise it will be the last index where the input was `<`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:

Output: **! {prev} {v1} (where prev is the last value of i where the input was >, or 0 if no input was >, and v1 is the last value of i where the input was <, or n-1 if all inputs were <)**
