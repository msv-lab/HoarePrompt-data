Based on the initial state provided:

- `kp` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`
- `v2` is 1

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Let's break down the values being printed:
- `v1` is 0
- `v2` is 1

So, the print statement will substitute these values into the string:

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
