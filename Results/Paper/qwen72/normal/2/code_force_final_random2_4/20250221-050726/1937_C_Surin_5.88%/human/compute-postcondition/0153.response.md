The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters but operates within an interactive environment. It interacts with a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1 and aims to find two indices `i` and `j` such that the XOR of `p[i]` and `p[j]` is maximized. The function is designed to achieve this using at most 3n queries. The function handles multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and for each test case, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4). The total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

Functionality: **The function operates in an interactive environment to find two indices `i` and `j` in a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, such that `p[i] ⊕ p[j]` is maximized, using at most 3n queries. It processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), with the total sum of `n` across all test cases not exceeding 10^4. The function returns the result of the queries and the final answer in a specific format.**
