Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, and `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`.**

### Explanation:
- **`kp`**: Remains 2 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains the input integer as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`g`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`v1`**: Remains the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`. This variable is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`.
- **`prev`**: This variable is updated to the last value of `i` where the input was `>`. If no input was `>`, `prev` remains 0.
