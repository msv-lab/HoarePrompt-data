Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `R` is now defined as a lambda function that reads an input, converts it to an integer, and returns it. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged: The function `I` is defined to read a line of input, split it into integers, and return them as a list. The function operates within an interactive environment where it interacts with a hidden permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1, and it must find two indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized using at most 3n queries. The function receives input through a series of queries and outputs the result of the queries and the final answer in a specific format. The number of test cases t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for kp in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    g = 0
    v1 = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        v2 = i
        print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input('')
        if r == '<':
            v1 = v2
    prev = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input()
        if r == '>':
            prev = i
    print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `kp` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`) if all inputs were `<`, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `kp` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`. The `sys.stdout.flush()` command has been executed, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream immediately.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `kp` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, and `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
