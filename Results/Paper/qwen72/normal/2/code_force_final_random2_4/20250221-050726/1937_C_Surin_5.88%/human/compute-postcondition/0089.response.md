The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all data written to `stdout` is immediately sent to the terminal or console. This operation does not change the values of any variables or affect the program's state beyond ensuring that any buffered output is displayed.

Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is 2, `prev` is 0, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is `>`, then `prev` is updated to 1.**
