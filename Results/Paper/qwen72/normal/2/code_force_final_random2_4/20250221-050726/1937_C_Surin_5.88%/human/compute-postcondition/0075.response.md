Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 3, `prev` is 0, `v2` is 3, and `r` is the user input.**

Explanation: The code snippet only updates the value of `r` to the user input. Since the user input is not specified, `r` is left as the user input. All other variables retain their original values as described in the initial state.
