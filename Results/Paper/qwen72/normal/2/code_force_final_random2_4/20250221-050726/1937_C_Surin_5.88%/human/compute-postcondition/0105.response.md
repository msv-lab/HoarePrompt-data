Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `v1` to 0, overriding its previous value (which could have been 0 or the last value of `i` where the input was `<`). The other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `i`, and `prev`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
