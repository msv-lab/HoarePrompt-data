Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cnt` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `ans` is `max(0, x - 1) + max(0, x - 1)`, `x` is the next element in `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `max(0, x - 1)` to its current value.
- The initial value of `ans` is `max(0, x - 1)`.
- After executing the code, `ans` becomes `max(0, x - 1) + max(0, x - 1)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `cnt`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
