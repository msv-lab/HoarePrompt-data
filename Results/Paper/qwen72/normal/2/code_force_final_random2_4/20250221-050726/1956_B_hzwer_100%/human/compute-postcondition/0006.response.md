To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is equal to `t`.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `cnt` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for x in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `x` and the list `a`.
- For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not run.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is the list `a`.
- To ensure the loop executes, `a` must have at least one element.

### Final State:
- The list `a` must have at least one element.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

### State:
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least one element, `cnt` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`**
