The value of `ans` is updated by adding `max(0, x - 1)` to its current value. The value of `x` is the next element in the list `cnt`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cnt` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `ans` is `max(0, x - 1) + max(0, x - 1) + max(0, x - 1)`, `x` is the next element in `cnt`.**
