To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), representing the number of cards each player receives.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), representing the integers on the cards in your hand.
- Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
- A line of input has been read from the standard input.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head contains the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`.
- The loop will execute if `int(input())` returns a positive integer.
- The state before the loop starts includes `t`, which is the number of test cases.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop will execute if `int(input())` returns a positive integer. Since `t` represents the number of test cases, and the loop is iterating over `t` test cases, `int(input())` should be equal to `t`.
- The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition.

### Final State:
- To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be a positive integer (i.e., \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)).
- The input read by `int(input())` should be equal to `t`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `int(input())` is equal to `t`**
