Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cnt` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will hold the sum of the values `max(0, x - 1)` for each element `x` in the list `cnt`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
