You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

- Program:
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
        for x in a:
            cnt[x] += 1
        ans = 0
        for x in cnt:
            ans += max(0, x - 1)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a sequence of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It then counts how many times each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the sequence. The function calculates the sum of the maximum of 0 and the count of each integer minus 1. This sum is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of points we can score in a card game where each player takes turns placing cards on a table.
   - The game involves a deck of 2n cards, with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice.
   - The goal is to maximize our score while considering that Nene will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize ours.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each integer appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - We need to count how many pairs of cards we have in our hand.
   - For each integer, if we have both cards, we can score 1 point when we place the second card on the table.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in our hand.
   - It initializes a list `cnt` to count the occurrences of each integer in our hand.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and increments the count for each integer.
   - It calculates the total score by summing up `max(0, x - 1)` for each count `x` in `cnt`. This ensures that we only count pairs of cards (i.e., if we have 2 cards of the same integer, we can score 1 point).

4. **Optimality Consideration:**
   - The program correctly counts the pairs of cards in our hand.
   - Since Nene plays optimally, she will always try to score points whenever possible. However, the program focuses on our optimal strategy, which is to count the pairs of cards we have.
   - The logic of adding `max(0, x - 1)` for each count `x` ensures that we only count pairs, which is the correct approach to maximize our score.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where we have no pairs (i.e., all counts are 1), resulting in a score of 0.
   - It also handles the case where we have multiple pairs, correctly summing up the points.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points we can score by counting the pairs of cards in our hand. Therefore, the program is correct.
