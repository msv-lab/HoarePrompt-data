Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cnt` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, and `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`. The loop has printed the value of `ans` for each test case.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range, as it is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer within the specified range, representing the number of cards each player receives.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and its length is `n`.
- `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where each element at index `i` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.
- `ans` is calculated as the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`, which effectively counts the number of extra cards (beyond one) for each card type.
- The loop prints the value of `ans` for each test case, and this process repeats for all `t` test cases.
