The code snippet `cnt[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` is initially a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, and `n` is equal to `t`, the length of `cnt` is `t + 1`. The value of `x` is not specified, but it must be a valid index for `cnt`, meaning `0 <= x <= t`.

Therefore, the value at index `x` in `cnt` is incremented by 1, while the rest of the variables and the structure of `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least one element, `cnt` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `cnt[x]` which is now 1.**
