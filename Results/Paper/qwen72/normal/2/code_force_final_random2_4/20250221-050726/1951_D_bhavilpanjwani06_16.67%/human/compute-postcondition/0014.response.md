Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
- `k` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions provided in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
