You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    elif n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(n)
    elif k - 1 < n - k + 1:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(n - k + 1, 1)
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. It then checks if `n` is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO". If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints "YES", followed by "1" and the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, it prints "YES", followed by "2" and the values `n - k + 1` and `1`. Otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value; it only prints the results based on the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case using a loop. It calls `func_1()` for each test case, which is a good practice for modular code.

2. **Reading Test Case Data**: Inside `func_1()`, the program reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

3. **Initial Check**: The program checks if `n < k`. If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels, so the program prints "NO". This check is correct.

4. **Exact Match**: If `n == k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with the price equal to `n`. This ensures that Alice will buy exactly one jewel, spending all her coins. This is a valid solution.

5. **Greedy Approach**: If `n > k` and `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, the program prints "YES" and sets up two stalls. The first stall has a price of `n - k + 1`, and the second stall has a price of `1`. This ensures that Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels at the first stall and 1 jewel at the second stall, totaling `k` jewels. This logic is correct because:
   - Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels at the first stall, spending `(k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins.
   - She will have `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins left, which is exactly `k - 1` coins.
   - At the second stall, she will buy 1 jewel, spending 1 coin, and thus buy exactly `k` jewels in total.

6. **Remaining Cases**: If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "NO". This is incorrect because it fails to consider other possible configurations of stalls that could allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. For example, if `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the program should be able to find a valid configuration of stalls, but it incorrectly prints "NO".

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases where a valid configuration of stalls exists.
