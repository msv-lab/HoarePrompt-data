You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        if (n == k) :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(1)
            #This is printed: 1
            print(n)
            #This is printed: n (where n is equal to k and both are input integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18)
        else :
            if (k - 1 < n - k + 1) :
                print('YES')
                #This is printed: YES
                print(2)
                #This is printed: 2
                print(n - k + 1, 1)
                #This is printed: n - k + 1, 1 (where n - k + 1 is the result of the expression n - k + 1)
            else :
                print('NO')
                #This is printed: NO
            #State: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`. If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`.
        #State: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, the condition holds true. If neither of these conditions hold, `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`.
    #State: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and `k` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. If `n` < `k`, the condition holds true. If `n` ≥ `k`, the condition holds true if `n` = `k` or if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. If neither of these conditions hold, `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
