The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c` and the list `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `s`. If the list `s` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `c` should be set to the first element of the list `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input binary string that must have at least 1 element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is 0, `c` is the first element of the list `s`**
