The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at the index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Let's analyze the impact of this code:

- `c` is the second element of the list `s`, which is an integer (0 or 1).
- `cnt` is initially set to `[1, 0]` if `c` is 0, or `[0, 0]` if `c` is 1.
- The value at the index `c` in `cnt` is incremented by 1.

Let's consider both cases:

### Case 1: `c` is 0
- Initial `cnt` is `[1, 0]`.
- After `cnt[c] += 1`, `cnt[0]` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
- So, `cnt` becomes `[2, 0]`.

### Case 2: `c` is 1
- Initial `cnt` is `[0, 0]`.
- After `cnt[c] += 1`, `cnt[1]` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`.
- So, `cnt` becomes `[0, 1]`.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [2, 0] if `c` is 0, or [0, 1] if `c` is 1, `ans` is 0 if `c` is 0, or `zeroes` if `c` is 1, and `c` is the second element of `s`.**
