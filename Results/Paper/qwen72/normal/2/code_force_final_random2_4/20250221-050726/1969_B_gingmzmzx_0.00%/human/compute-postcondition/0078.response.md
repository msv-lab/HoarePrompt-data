The function `func_1` seems to be missing the parameters in the provided signature. Based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it appears that the function should accept two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases) and `s` (a binary string for each test case). However, since the function signature does not include these parameters, I will assume they are part of the function's intended design but not explicitly shown.

Given the context, the function likely processes a series of test cases, each with a binary string `s`, and returns some result based on the processing of these strings. The exact nature of the processing and the return value is not specified, but we can infer the general functionality based on the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts a binary string `s`. It processes each binary string and returns a result based on the processing of these strings. The function ensures that `t` is within the range 1 to 10^4, and each binary string `s` has a length between 2 and 2 · 10^5, with the total length of all strings not exceeding 2 · 10^5.**
