To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string that must have at least 3 elements.
   - `n` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1.
   - `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`.
   - `cnt` is [3, 0] if `c` is 0, or [0, 2] if `c` is 1.
   - `c` is the third element of `s`.
   - If `c` is 0, `ans` is 0.
   - If `c` is 1, `ans` is `zeroes + 1`.
   - If `c` is 0, `ans` is `zeroes - 2`.
   - If `c` is 1, `ans` is `2 * zeroes`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
   ```

3. **Impact Analysis**:
   - The code snippet checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0.
   - If `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - If `cnt[1]` is not greater than 0, `ans` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine `cnt[1]`**:
   - If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [3, 0], so `cnt[1]` is 0.
   - If `c` is 1, `cnt` is [0, 2], so `cnt[1]` is 2.

5. **Update `ans`**:
   - If `c` is 0, `cnt[1]` is 0, so `ans` remains unchanged.
   - If `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` is 2, so `ans` is incremented by 1.

6. **Final Output State**:
   - If `c` is 0, `ans` remains `zeroes - 2`.
   - If `c` is 1, `ans` becomes `2 * zeroes + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [3, 0] if `c` is 0, or [0, 2] if `c` is 1, `c` is the third element of `s`, if `c` is 0, `ans` is `zeroes - 2`, if `c` is 1, `ans` is `2 * zeroes + 1`.**
