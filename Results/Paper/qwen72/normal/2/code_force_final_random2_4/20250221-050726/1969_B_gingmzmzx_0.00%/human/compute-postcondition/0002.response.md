The code snippet `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and converts each character of the resulting string into an integer, storing these integers in a list `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a binary string with 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5
- The sum of lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `n` must be greater than 0

After executing the code, the variable `s` is updated to be a list of integers, where each integer is the corresponding digit from the input string (which should be a binary string).

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input binary string, the sum of lengths of lists over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `n` must be greater than 0.**
