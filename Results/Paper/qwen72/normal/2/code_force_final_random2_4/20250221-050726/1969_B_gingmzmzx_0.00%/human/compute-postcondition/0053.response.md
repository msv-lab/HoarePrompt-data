The provided Python code snippet reads a new input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and then maps each character of the input string to an integer, converting the entire input into a list of integers. This list is then assigned to the variable `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string
- `n` is 1
- `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`
- `cnt` is [count of 0s in `s`, count of 1s in `s`]
- `ans` is the sum of `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each 1 in `s` plus the sum of 1 for each 0 in `s` when there is at least one 1 before it

After executing the code snippet:
- `s` is now updated to the new list of integers derived from the user's input, which represents a binary string (each element is either 0 or 1).

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans`) remain unchanged because they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [count of 0s in `s`, count of 1s in `s`], `ans` is the sum of `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each 1 in `s` plus the sum of 1 for each 0 in `s` when there is at least one 1 before it.**
