Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a binary string with 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, the sum of lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    zeroes = s.count(0)
    cnt = [0, 0]
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        cnt[c] += 1
        if c == 0:
            ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
        else:
            ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input binary string, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [number of zeros in `s`, number of ones in `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of ones before each zero in `s` plus the number of zeros after each one in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string, `n` is 0, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [count of 0s in `s`, count of 1s in `s`], `ans` is the sum of `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each 1 in `s` plus the sum of 1 for each 0 in `s` when there is at least one 1 before it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [number of 0s in `s`, number of 1s in `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s in `s` multiplied by the total number of zeros in `s` minus the cumulative count of 0s encountered up to each 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
