You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, s is a binary string with 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the final input binary string, `n` is 0, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [number of 0s in `s`, number of 1s in `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s in `s` multiplied by the total number of zeros in `s` minus the cumulative count of 0s encountered up to each 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5) and calculates a value `ans` based on the positions of '0's and '1's in the string. Specifically, for each '1' in the string, it adds the number of '0's that come after it in the string to `ans`. The function prints the calculated `ans` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ends, and the state is such that `t` remains unchanged, `s` is the last processed binary string converted to a list of integers, `n` is 0, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the last `s`, `cnt` is the count of '0's and '1's in the last `s`, and `ans` is the final calculated value for the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string is already sorted. For example, consider the input "0000". According to the problem description, the output should be 0 since the string is already sorted. However, the current implementation will incorrectly calculate a non-zero cost because it always adds to `ans` whenever it encounters a '0' after a '1', which is unnecessary in this case. This means the program fails to meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
