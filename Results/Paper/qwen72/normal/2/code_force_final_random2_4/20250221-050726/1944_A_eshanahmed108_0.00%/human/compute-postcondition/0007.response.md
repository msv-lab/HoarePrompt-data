The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are input integers, and the code updates these variables based on the new input.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^3, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer.**
