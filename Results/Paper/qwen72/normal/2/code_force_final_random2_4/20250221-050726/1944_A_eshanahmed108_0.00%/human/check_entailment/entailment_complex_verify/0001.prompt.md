You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2, representing the number of islands and the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
        
    #State: _ is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `k`, representing the number of islands and the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed, respectively. For each test case, the function prints the number of islands (`n`) if the difference between the number of islands and the number of bridges that can be destroyed (`n - k`) is less than or equal to 1; otherwise, it prints 1. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program includes the number of test cases processed (`t`), the last values of `n` and `k` read from the input, and the placeholder `_` used in the loop.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` islands, initially fully connected.
   - Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit.
   - We need to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after the optimal destruction of bridges.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `k` is 0, no bridges are destroyed, so Everule can visit all `n` islands.
   - If `k` is large enough to disconnect all bridges from island 1, Everule can only visit island 1.
   - The critical point is when `k` is just enough to disconnect island 1 from all other islands. This happens when `k` is at least `n-1` because destroying `n-1` bridges will isolate island 1.

3. **Logic in the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It prints `n` if `n - k <= 1`, otherwise it prints `1`.

4. **Analysis of the Logic:**
   - If `n - k <= 1`, this means that `k` is at least `n-1`. In this case, Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1, so Everule can only visit island 1.
   - If `n - k > 1`, this means that `k` is less than `n-1`. In this case, Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely, so Everule can still visit all `n` islands.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `k = 0`, the condition `n - k <= 1` is false, so the program correctly prints `n`.
   - When `k = n-1`, the condition `n - k <= 1` is true, so the program correctly prints `1`.
   - When `k > n-1`, the condition `n - k <= 1` is true, so the program correctly prints `1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and follows the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
