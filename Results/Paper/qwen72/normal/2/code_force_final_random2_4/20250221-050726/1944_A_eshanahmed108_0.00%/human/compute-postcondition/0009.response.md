Output State: **_ is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the state remains consistent with the initial conditions provided. The variable `t` still represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, the integers `n` and `k` are read from the input. The loop itself processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`, and then prints either `n` if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, or 1 otherwise. The loop does not modify the value of `t` or the input values of `n` and `k` beyond their initial reads. Therefore, the final state is the same as the initial state, with the loop having processed all `t` test cases.
