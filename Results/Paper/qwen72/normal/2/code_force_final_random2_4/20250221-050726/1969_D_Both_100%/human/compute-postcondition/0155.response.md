Output State: **`k` is 0, `_` is -1, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, `heap` contains all the elements that were originally in `combined`, sorted according to the second element of each tuple, if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `heap` remains unchanged, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains unchanged, `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and `max_profit` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.
- The values of `k` and `_` remain unchanged.
- The state of `heap` and `current_profit` depends on whether `combined` is empty or not, as described in the initial state.
- The variables `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and the new value of `max_profit` remain unchanged.
