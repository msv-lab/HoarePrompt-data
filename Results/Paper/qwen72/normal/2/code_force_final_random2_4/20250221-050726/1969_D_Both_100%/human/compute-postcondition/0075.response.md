The code snippet sorts the list `combined` based on the second element of each tuple (i.e., the elements from `bonuses`). This sorting operation does not change the values of the elements in `combined`, only their order. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0.**
