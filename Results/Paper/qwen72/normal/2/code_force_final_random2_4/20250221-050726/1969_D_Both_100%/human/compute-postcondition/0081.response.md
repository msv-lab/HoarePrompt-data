The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` performs two main actions:

1. It pops the last element from the `combined` list, which is a sorted list of tuples.
2. It pushes this popped element into the `heap`.

Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- `combined` is a sorted list of tuples, and it is one element shorter after the operation.
- `heap` is updated to include the last element from `combined`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1, `heap` is a list containing the last tuple from `combined` (now including the previously last tuple), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple, and if `combined` was not empty, it is now one element shorter, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0.**
