The code snippet `combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])` sorts the list `combined` based on the second element of each tuple in ascending order.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `heap` is an empty list
- `remaining_items` is an empty list
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`
- `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`
- `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`
- `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`
- `max_profit` is 0
- `current_profit` is 0
- `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `combined` is sorted based on the second element of each tuple in ascending order.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order.**
