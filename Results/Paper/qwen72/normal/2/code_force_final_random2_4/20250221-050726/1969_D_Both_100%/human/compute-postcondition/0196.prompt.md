You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n and k are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, prices is a list of integers representing the prices Alice pays for the items, bonuses is a list of integers representing the bonuses Bob pays for the items, and both prices and bonuses have the same length n.
def func_4():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        heap = []
        
        remaining_items = []
        
        n, k = func_2()
        
        prices = list(func_2())
        
        neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]
        
        bonuses = list(func_2())
        
        max_profit = 0

        for _ in range(k):
            if combined:
                heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
        
        if combined:
            current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
        
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
        
        while combined:
            item = combined.pop()
            if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
                current_profit -= item[1]
            else:
                current_profit += item[0]
            removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
            if removed_item:
                current_profit -= removed_item[0]
            if current_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = current_profit
        
        print(max_profit)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `test_cases` is 0, `_` is `k-1` for the last iteration, `k` is the value returned by `func_2()` for the last iteration, `heap` contains the `k` tuples with the highest second elements from the last `combined` list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` for the last iteration, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()` for the last iteration, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices` for the last iteration, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()` for the last iteration, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final adjusted profit after processing all items in `combined` for the last iteration, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit observed during the loop execution for the last iteration. The variables `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged for each iteration, but their values are updated based on the return values of `func_2()` for each new iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `test_cases`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, and `bonuses`. If `k` is 0, it returns the sum of all elements in the `prices` list. If `k` is greater than 0, it returns the sum of the first `k` elements in the `prices` list plus the sum of the first `k` elements in the `bonuses` list.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
