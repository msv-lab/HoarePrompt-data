The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be decremented by 1, and `_` will increment by 1.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list unless `combined` is not empty, in which case `heap` contains the tuple with the highest second element from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, and if `combined` is not empty, it is one element shorter.**
