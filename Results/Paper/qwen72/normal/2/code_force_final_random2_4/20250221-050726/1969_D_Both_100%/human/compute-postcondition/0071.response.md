Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, and `max_profit` is the maximum value of `current_profit` observed during the loop execution.**

Explanation:
- The code `bonuses = list(func_2())` assigns the list returned by `func_2()` to the variable `bonuses`.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `_`, `k`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `combined`, and `max_profit`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state specifies that `bonuses` was already a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, so the assignment does not change its value.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that `bonuses` is explicitly stated to be a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
