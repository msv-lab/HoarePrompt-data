Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` contains `k` tuples with the highest second elements from `combined` (potentially including the new `item` and excluding the smallest element), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, but now it is `len(combined) - k - 3` elements shorter, and `combined` must contain at least one element, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the element that was popped from `heap` and replaced by the previous `item`. If `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`, and `max_profit` is updated to `max_profit` if `current_profit` is not greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. If `removed_item` is `None`, `current_profit` and `max_profit` remain unchanged. `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`.**

Explanation:
- The code `max_profit = current_profit` updates the value of `max_profit` to be the same as `current_profit`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
