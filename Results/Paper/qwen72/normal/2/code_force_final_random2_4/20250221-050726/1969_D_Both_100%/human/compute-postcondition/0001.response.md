To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `_` and `test_cases`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` is greater than 0. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `prices`, `bonuses`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given that `test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()`, we need to ensure that `func_1()` returns a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0 (initial value for the loop iterator)**
