Output State: **`k` is 0, `_` is `k-1`. If `combined` had enough elements, it is now empty, and `heap` contains all the elements that were originally in `combined`, sorted according to the second element of each tuple. If `combined` did not have enough elements, it will have fewer elements, and `heap` will contain as many elements as were available in `combined`. The state of `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `current_profit`, and `max_profit` remains unchanged.**
