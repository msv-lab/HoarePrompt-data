To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `check_all` is `False`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 2 to the end (or starting from index 1 to the end if `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]`).
   - `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or objects.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
