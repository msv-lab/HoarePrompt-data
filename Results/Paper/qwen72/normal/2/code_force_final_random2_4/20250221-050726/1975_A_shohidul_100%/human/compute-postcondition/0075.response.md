To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `_` is 1.
2. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
3. `n` must be greater than 3.
4. `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
5. `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`.
6. `i` is 3.
7. `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list.
8. `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`.
9. `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print('YES')` statement is:

Output: **YES**
