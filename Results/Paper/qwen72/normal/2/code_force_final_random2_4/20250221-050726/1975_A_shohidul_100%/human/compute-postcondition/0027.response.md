Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `check_all` is `False`.
- `i` is 2.
- `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 2 to the end (or starting from index 1 to the end if `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]`).
- `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`.
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement because it is printing a constant string.

Output: **NO**
