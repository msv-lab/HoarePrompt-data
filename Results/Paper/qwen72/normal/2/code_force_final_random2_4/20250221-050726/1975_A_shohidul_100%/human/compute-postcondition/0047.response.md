Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 1.
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`.
- `i` is set to `n-1` if `check_all` is `False`, and the loop has checked each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.

The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
