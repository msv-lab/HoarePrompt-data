The given code snippet updates the variable `new_all` by checking if all elements in the list `new` are in non-decreasing order. This is done by iterating through the list `new` starting from index 1 to the end, and checking if each element is less than or equal to the next element.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 1
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input
- `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`
- `i` is 2
- `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 2 to the end of the list
- `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`
- `new_all` remains unchanged

After executing the code:
- `new_all` is updated to `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **_ is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`, `i` is 2, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 2 to the end of the list, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.**
