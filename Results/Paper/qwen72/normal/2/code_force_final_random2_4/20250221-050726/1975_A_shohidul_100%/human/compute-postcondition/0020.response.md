Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `check_all` is `False`, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, the most internal loop or if statement is also broken out of.***
