Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not non-decreasing.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `check_all` is `False`, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, the most internal loop or if statement is also broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `check_all` is `False`, `i` is 2. If `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 2 to the end. `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`. `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is also broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `check_all` is `False`, `i` is 3, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end. If `a[2] > a[3]`, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is also broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
