Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`, `i` is 1, the current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 1 to the end of the list, `check_all_new` is `False`, `new_all` is `False`. Additionally, `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`.**
