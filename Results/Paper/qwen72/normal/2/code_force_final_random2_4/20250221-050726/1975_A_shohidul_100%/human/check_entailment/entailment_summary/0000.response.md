Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. **Initial Check for Non-Decreasing Order**: The program correctly checks if the array is already non-decreasing using `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. If the array is already non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'.

2. **Splitting and Swapping Logic**: The program then tries to find a split point where the array can be divided into two parts such that when swapped, the resulting array is non-decreasing. This is done by iterating through the array and checking if the current element is greater than the next element (`if a[i - 1] > a[i]`). If such a point is found, it creates a new array `new` from the split point onwards and checks two conditions:
   - `check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])`: This condition checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in the new array.
   - `new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])`: This condition checks if the new array is non-decreasing.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Swapping**: The logic for checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping is flawed. Specifically, the condition `check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])` is incorrect because it checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in the new array, which is not the correct condition for ensuring the entire array is non-decreasing after the swap.

4. **Early Termination**: The program breaks out of the loop as soon as it finds a potential split point, which may lead to incorrect results if there are multiple possible split points.

To fix the logic, the program should:
- Find the split point where the array can be divided into two parts such that when swapped, the resulting array is non-decreasing.
- Ensure that the entire array is checked for non-decreasing order after the swap.

Given the issues in the logic, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
