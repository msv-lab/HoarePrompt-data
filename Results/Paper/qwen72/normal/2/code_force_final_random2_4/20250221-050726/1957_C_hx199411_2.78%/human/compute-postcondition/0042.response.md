Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5; `k` is an input integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`; `i` is `k - 1` if `m` is 1, otherwise `i` is `m`; `c` and `r` are the last pair of integers read from the input; `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are equal, and 2 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are not equal, over all `k` iterations; `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, no further changes occur. If `m` is 1, no further changes occur. If `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, and specific values are assigned to `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, `dp[3]`, etc., up to `dp[m]` as calculated by the loop.**
