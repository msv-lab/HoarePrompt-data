Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5; `k` is an input integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`; `i` is 1; `c` and `r` are updated to the integers read from the input. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 4.***
