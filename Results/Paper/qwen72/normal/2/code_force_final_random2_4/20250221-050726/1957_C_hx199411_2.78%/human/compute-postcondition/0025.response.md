Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer input by the user and was initially greater than 0, but it is now `t - 1`.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5.
- `k` is an input integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`.
- `i` is `k - 1`.
- `c` and `r` are the last pair of integers read from the input.
- `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are equal, and 2 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are not equal, over all `k` iterations.
- `m` is `n - num`, and the current value of `m` is 0.

Given the `print(0)` statement, the value being printed is explicitly 0. The value of `m` is also mentioned to be 0, which aligns with the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **0**
