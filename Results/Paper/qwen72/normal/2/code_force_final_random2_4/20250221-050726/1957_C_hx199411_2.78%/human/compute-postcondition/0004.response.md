Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5; `k` is an input integer where 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`; `num` is 0.** 

The variable `num` is initialized to 0, while the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
