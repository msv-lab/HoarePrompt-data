Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `t` is decremented by 1 (and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again). `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, and `k` must be greater than 1. `c` and `r` are integers input by the user. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` was initially set to 1. Otherwise, `num` was initially set to 2. `i` is 1. `c` and `r` are now updated to the new integers input by the user. `num` is now `num` + 2.**
