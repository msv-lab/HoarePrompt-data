### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a game where you and the computer take turns placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard.
   - The goal is to count the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made.
   - The computer mirrors your moves, except when the move is on the diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)), in which case it skips its turn.
   - The solution needs to handle multiple test cases and output the number of configurations modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), the size of the board and the number of initial moves.
   - It then reads the \( k \) moves and processes them to determine the number of rooks already placed.

3. **Counting Initial Rooks:**
   - The program iterates through the \( k \) moves and increments `num` by 1 if the move is on the diagonal (i.e., \( c == r \)) and by 2 otherwise.
   - This correctly counts the number of rooks already placed on the board.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The program calculates the number of possible configurations for the remaining \( m = n - num \) positions using dynamic programming.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with base cases: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation is correctly implemented: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the value of `dp[m]`.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initialization and Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly initializes `t` and processes each test case.
  - The reading of \( n \) and \( k \) is done correctly.
  - The reading of the \( k \) moves is also correct.

- **Counting Initial Rooks:**
  - The logic for counting the number of rooks already placed is correct. If the move is on the diagonal, it increments `num` by 1; otherwise, it increments `num` by 2.

- **Dynamic Programming:**
  - The initialization of the DP array is correct: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
  - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is correct and follows the combinatorial logic for placing rooks on the board.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the edge cases where \( m = 0 \) (no remaining positions) and \( m = 1 \) (one remaining position).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of different final configurations of the chessboard. It handles the input and output correctly, and the dynamic programming approach is appropriate for solving the problem.

Final: **True**
