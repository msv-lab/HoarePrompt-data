To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0.
- `t` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.
- `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, and `k` must be greater than 0.
- `c` and `r` are integers input by the user. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is set to 1. Otherwise, `num` is set to 2.
- `i` remains 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the constant `k`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

### State Adjustments:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The value of `k` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `t` is decremented by 1 (and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again). `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, and `k` must be greater than 1. `c` and `r` are integers input by the user. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is set to 1. Otherwise, `num` is set to 2. `i` is 1.**
