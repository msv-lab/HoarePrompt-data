The code snippet reads two integers from the user input, splits them by a space, and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r` respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5; `k` is an input integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`; `num` is 0; `i` is 0; `c` is an input integer; `r` is an input integer.**
