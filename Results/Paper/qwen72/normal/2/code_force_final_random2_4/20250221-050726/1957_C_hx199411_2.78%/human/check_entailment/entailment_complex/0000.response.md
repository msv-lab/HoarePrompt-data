Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard, given the rules and constraints specified. Here's a breakdown of the key aspects of the program and their correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.

2. **Move Processing**: The program iterates through the `k` moves, updating a counter `num` based on whether the move is on the diagonal (`r == c`) or not. This part is correct because it accurately reflects the problem statement's rule that if the move is on the diagonal, the computer skips its turn, and if not, the computer mirrors the move.

3. **Remaining Squares Calculation**: The program calculates the remaining squares `m` as `n - num`. This is correct because it accounts for the squares that are already occupied by the initial moves and their mirrored counterparts.

4. **Dynamic Programming Solution**: The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on the remaining squares. The initialization of `dp[1]` to 1 and `dp[2]` to 3 is correct based on the base cases. The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is also correct, as it correctly counts the number of ways to place rooks on `i` squares, considering both the placement of a rook in the current row and the placement of rooks in the previous rows.

5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the result for each test case, ensuring that the answer is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
