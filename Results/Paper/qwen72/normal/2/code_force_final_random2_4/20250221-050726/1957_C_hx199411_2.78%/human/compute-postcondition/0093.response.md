Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `k` are the integers input by the user, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are the new integers input by the user, `num` is 0, `m` is `n - num`, if `m` is 0, the current value of `m` remains 0, if `m` is 1, the current value of `m` remains 1, otherwise, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for each `i` from 3 to `m` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), and `c` is not equal to `r`.**
