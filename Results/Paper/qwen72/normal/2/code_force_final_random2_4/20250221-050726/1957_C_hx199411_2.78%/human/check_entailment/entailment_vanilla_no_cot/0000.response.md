Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Initial Setup**: For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.

3. **Counting Initial Moves**: It counts the number of initial moves where the rook is placed on the diagonal (`c == r`) and non-diagonal positions (`c != r`). This helps in determining how many positions are already occupied and how many are still available for further moves.

4. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Initialization**: The program initializes a DP array to store the number of possible configurations for different numbers of available positions. The base cases are correctly set:
   - `dp[1] = 1`: Only one way to place a rook in a 1x1 board.
   - `dp[2] = 3`: Three ways to place rooks in a 2x2 board (two non-attacking configurations plus one diagonal configuration).

5. **DP Transition**: The program correctly calculates the number of configurations for larger boards using the formula:
   - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`: This accounts for placing a rook in a new row and column, and considering the mirrored placement by the computer.

6. **Output**: The program prints the number of possible configurations for the remaining positions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program seems to handle all aspects of the problem correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
