Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0.
- `t` is decremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.
- `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, with `k` being greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
- `i` is set to `k-1`.
- `c` and `r` are the last integers input by the user.
- `num` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r`, or by 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`.
- `m` is calculated as `n - num`.
- `m` is not equal to 0.
- The current value of `m` is 1.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print(1)
```

The value `1` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
