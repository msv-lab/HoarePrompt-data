### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a game where you and the computer take turns placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard.
   - The goal is to count the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made.
   - The computer mirrors your moves, except when the move is on the diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)), in which case it skips its turn.
   - The solution needs to handle multiple test cases and output the number of configurations modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), the size of the board and the number of initial moves.
   - It then reads the \( k \) moves and processes them to determine the number of rooks already placed.

3. **Counting Initial Rooks:**
   - The program iterates through the \( k \) moves and increments `num` by 1 if the move is on the diagonal (i.e., \( c == r \)) and by 2 otherwise.
   - This correctly counts the number of rooks already placed on the board.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The program calculates the number of possible configurations for the remaining \( m = n - num \) positions using dynamic programming.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with base cases: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation is correctly implemented: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the value of `dp[m]`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initial Moves Counting:**
  - The program correctly counts the number of rooks already placed on the board. For each move, if the move is on the diagonal, it adds 1 to `num`; otherwise, it adds 2. This is correct because each non-diagonal move places two rooks (one by you and one by the computer), while a diagonal move places only one rook (and the computer skips its turn).

- **Dynamic Programming:**
  - The dynamic programming approach is used to calculate the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on the remaining squares.
  - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correct:
    - `dp[1] = 1` because there is only one way to place one rook on a 1x1 board.
    - `dp[2] = 3` because there are three ways to place two rooks on a 2x2 board without attacking each other.
  - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is also correct:
    - `dp[i - 1]` accounts for the case where the last rook is placed in a way that does not affect the previous placements.
    - `(i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2` accounts for the case where the last two rooks are placed in a way that they do not attack each other, and there are `i - 1` choices for the first of these two rooks.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles edge cases where `m` is 0 or 1:
    - If `m == 0`, it prints 0 because there are no remaining squares to place rooks.
    - If `m == 1`, it prints 1 because there is only one way to place one rook on a 1x1 board.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of different final configurations of the chessboard. It handles the input and output correctly, and the dynamic programming approach is appropriate for solving the problem.

Final: **True**
