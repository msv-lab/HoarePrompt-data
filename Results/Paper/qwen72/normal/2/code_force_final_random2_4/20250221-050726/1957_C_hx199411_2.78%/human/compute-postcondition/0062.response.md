Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `t` is decremented by 1 (and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again). `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, and `k` must be greater than 2. `i` is 2. `c` and `r` are now updated to the new integers input by the user. `num` is increased by 2.**
