Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, and it is then decremented by 1.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5.
- `k` is an input integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`.
- `i` is `k - 1`.
- `c` and `r` are the last pair of integers read from the input.
- `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are equal, and 2 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are not equal, over all `k` iterations.
- `m` is `n - num`.
- Additionally, `m` is not equal to 0, and the current value of `m` is 1.

Given this information, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(1)
```

This statement simply prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
