Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user with `k` being greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are the new integers input by the user, `num` is the total number of times `c` and `r` were compared, which is either `k` if `c == r` for all comparisons, or `2 * k` if `c != r` for all comparisons, `m` is `n - num`, and `m` is not 0. If `m` is 1, the current value of `m` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for each `i` from 3 to `m` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).`**
