Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case. Each test case involves reading the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.

2. **Score Calculation**: The function calculates a score `num` based on the initial moves. If a move is on the diagonal (`r == c`), it adds 1 to the score; otherwise, it adds 2. This part is correct because it accurately reflects the number of positions occupied by rooks, considering the mirrored moves by the computer.

3. **Remaining Squares Calculation**: The function calculates the remaining squares `m` as `n - num`. This is correct because it accounts for the squares already occupied by the initial moves and their mirrored counterparts.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Remaining Squares**: The function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on the remaining squares. The DP array `dp` is initialized correctly, and the transitions are computed as follows:
   - `dp[1] = 1`: One way to place a rook on a 1x1 board.
   - `dp[2] = 3`: Three ways to place rooks on a 2x2 board.
   - For `i >= 3`, the transition is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. This formula correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on an `i x i` board by considering the placement of a rook in the first row and the remaining configurations.

5. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
