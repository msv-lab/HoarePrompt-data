Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length `n` containing only uppercase letters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers where each element at index `i` (0 <= i < 7) represents the number of occurrences of the character `chr(i + ord('A'))` in the string `a`, `needed_problems` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `count[i]` is less than `m`.**
