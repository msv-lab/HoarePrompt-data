Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by the string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems.
3. **Counting Problem Difficulties**: The function `func_1` initializes a list `count` of size 7 to keep track of the number of problems for each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` list based on the character's position in the alphabet.
4. **Calculating Needed Problems**: The program then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level. If the count of a particular difficulty level is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`.
5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

The logic and implementation of the program align with the problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
