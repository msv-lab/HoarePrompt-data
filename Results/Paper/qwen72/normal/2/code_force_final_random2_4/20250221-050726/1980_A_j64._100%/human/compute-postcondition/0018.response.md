Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length `n` containing only uppercase letters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers representing the number of occurrences of characters 'A' to 'G' in `a`, `i` is 2, and `needed_problems` is updated as follows: if `count[2]` is less than `m`, then `needed_problems` is increased by `(m - count[2])`. Otherwise, `needed_problems` remains unchanged.***
