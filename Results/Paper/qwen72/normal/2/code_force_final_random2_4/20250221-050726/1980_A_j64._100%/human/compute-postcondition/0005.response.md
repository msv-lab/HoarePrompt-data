The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `a`. If there are more characters left in `a`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `char` was the second character in `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be the next (third) character in `a`, assuming `a` has at least three characters.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length `n` containing only uppercase letters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers where the element at index `ord(char) - ord('A')` is 2 and the rest are 0, `char` is the third character in `a`.**
