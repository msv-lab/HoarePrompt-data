Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is handled well and aligns with the problem description.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, the program reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by the string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems. This is also correctly implemented.
3. **Counting Problem Difficulties**: The function `func_1` initializes a list `count` of size 7 to keep track of the number of problems for each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` list based on the character's position in the alphabet. This is done using `ord(char) - ord('A')`, which correctly maps 'A' to 0, 'B' to 1, and so on. This part is correct.
4. **Calculating Needed Problems**: The program then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level. If the count of a particular difficulty level is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`. This logic ensures that for each difficulty level, the number of problems is at least `m`. This is the core of the solution and is implemented correctly.
5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case. The output format matches the problem description.

Given the above points, the program correctly follows the problem description and constraints. The function `func_1` accurately counts the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
