Output State: **`sumo` is the sum of the integer values of the modified elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is 1, `bets` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, each element in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1` is now equal to `prod // a[i]` before the modification, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space and the string representation of `a[1]` followed by a space, `i` is 2**.
