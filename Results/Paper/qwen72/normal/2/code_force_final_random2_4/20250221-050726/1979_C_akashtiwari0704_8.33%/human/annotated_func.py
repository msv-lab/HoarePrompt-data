#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the number of outcomes. k_1, k_2, ..., k_n are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        prod = 1
        
        for i in range(bets):
            prod *= a[i]
        
        sumo = 0
        
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `t - 1`, `bets` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of the modified elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, and each element in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1` is now `prod // a[index]`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no further action is taken. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is the string representation of all elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, each followed by a space.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the user, where each test case involves a set of multipliers. For each test case, it calculates a product of these multipliers and then modifies the multipliers such that each is replaced by the product divided by the original multiplier. It sums these modified multipliers and checks if this sum is less than the original product. If the sum is less, it prints the modified multipliers as a space-separated string; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function processes up to `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000. Each test case involves up to 50 multipliers, each between 2 and 20.
