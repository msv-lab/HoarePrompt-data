You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `t - 1`, `bets` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of the modified elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, and each element in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1` is now `prod // a[index]`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no further action is taken. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is the string representation of all elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, each followed by a space.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to place bets on `n` outcomes such that the total bet is strictly less than the return from any winning outcome.
   - The return from the winning outcome is the bet on that outcome multiplied by its corresponding multiplier `k_i`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a` for each outcome.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.
   - It then sets each bet `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]` and sums up all the bets to get `sumo`.
   - If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Product Calculation:** The product of all multipliers `prod` is calculated correctly.
   - **Bet Calculation:** Each bet `a[i]` is set to `prod // a[i]`, which ensures that the return from the winning outcome is `prod`.
   - **Sum Check:** The sum of all bets `sumo` should be strictly less than `prod` for the solution to be valid.
   - **Output:** The program prints the bets if they are valid, otherwise it prints `-1`.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Overflow:** The product `prod` can become very large, potentially leading to overflow issues. However, since the constraints are manageable (up to 50 outcomes with multipliers up to 20), this is unlikely to cause an issue.
   - **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases where no valid distribution is possible by printing `-1`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of bets or determine that no valid distribution exists.
   - The approach ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the return from any winning outcome.
