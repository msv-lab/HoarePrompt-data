Output State: **`sumo` is the sum of the updated values of the first `bets` elements in `a` (each updated to `prod // a[i]`), `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is 2, `bets` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 2, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `prod` is the product of all elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is 2, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space, the string representation of `a[1]` followed by a space, and the string representation of `a[2]` followed by a space.**
