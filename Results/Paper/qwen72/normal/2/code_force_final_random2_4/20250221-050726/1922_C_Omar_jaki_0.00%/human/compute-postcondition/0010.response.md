To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the current state:

### Current State:
- `t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1.
- `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9.
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.
- `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i.
- `b` is `[0, 0, v`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variables `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are derived from the list `a` using the `zip` function.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are enough elements in `a` to form the tuples `(w, x, y, z)`.
3. **Current State of `a`**: At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has already processed the first three elements of `a`. Therefore, the next iteration will process the next set of four elements starting from the fourth element.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **List `a`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 4 elements remaining. Since the loop has already processed the first three elements, `a` must have at least 7 elements in total for the next iteration to occur.
- **Indices**: The indices for the next iteration will be shifted by 1. Specifically, the next values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be `a[3]`, `a[4]`, `a[5]`, and `a[6]` respectively.

### Updated State:
- `t` remains a non-zero integer decreased by 1.
- `n` remains an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` must have at least 7 elements.
- `m` remains an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.
- `queries` remains a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i.
- `b` remains `[0, 0, v`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9 and n must be at least 7, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, `b` is `[0, 0, v`.**
