You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    5 1

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n` and their positions `a`.
   - It then reads the number of queries `m` and processes each query.

2. **City Position Handling:**
   - The city positions are read into a list `a` with padding at the beginning and end to handle edge cases.
   - The list `a` is modified to include `-1000000000.0` and `2000000000.0` to ensure that the first and last cities have a defined closest city.

3. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function uses a list `b` to store cumulative distances.
   - It iterates through the city positions using `zip` to compare distances between consecutive cities.
   - The distances are calculated and stored in `b` to keep track of the cumulative cost of traveling to the closest city.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the function checks if the starting city `c` is less than the destination city `d`.
   - If `c < d`, it calculates the cost using the precomputed cumulative distances in `b`.
   - If `c >= d`, it calculates the cost similarly but in the reverse direction.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The padding values in `a` ensure that the first and last cities have a defined closest city.
   - The use of `zip` and list comprehension ensures that the distances are correctly calculated and stored.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The function processes each test case and query efficiently, ensuring that the time complexity is within acceptable limits for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities based on the given problem description. The use of precomputed cumulative distances and the handling of edge cases are appropriate.
