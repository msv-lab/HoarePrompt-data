To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`a`**: Has its original length.
2. **`b`**: Has been extended by `2 * (len(a) - 3)` elements.
   - Each pair of new elements in `b` is calculated as follows:
     - The first new element is `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `b[-2] + 1`.
     - The second new element is `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y`, otherwise `b[-1] + 1`.
3. **`t`, `n`, `m`, `queries`**: Remain unchanged.
4. **`u`**: Is now `u - 3` and must be a truthy value.
5. **`c` and `d`**: Are assigned the values returned by the function `r()`.
   - If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`.
   - Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Determine the values of `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by the function `r()`.
   - The relationship between `c` and `d` is given: if `c < d`, then `c` is less than `d`; otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

2. **Access elements in `b`**:
   - The expression `b[c * 2 - 1]` accesses the element in `b` at the index `c * 2 - 1`.
   - The expression `b[d * 2 - 1]` accesses the element in `b` at the index `d * 2 - 1`.

3. **Calculate the difference**:
   - The print statement calculates the difference between the elements accessed by `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the logic, the exact numerical values of `c` and `d` are not specified, but we know their relationship. The values of `b` are also not explicitly given, but they are determined by the rules provided.

Since the exact values of `c` and `d` and the elements in `b` are not known, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()` and `b` is the list extended according to the given rules)**
