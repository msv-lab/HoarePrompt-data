To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a` is `-1000000000.0`
- `c` and `d` are assigned the new values returned by the function `r()`
- `b` is `[0, 0]`
- `n`, `m`, `queries`, and `u` remain unchanged
- `u` is `0` (falsy value)
- `c` is less than `d` if the new `c` is less than the new `d`; otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `v` is `y - x`

### Code Snippet:
```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `b` is `[0, 0]`
   - `v` is `y - x`

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `b[-2]` is the second-to-last element of `b`, which is `0`.
   - `b[-1]` is the last element of `b`, which is `0`.
   - `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v` if `v > x - w` is `True`, otherwise `1` (since `v ** 0` is `1`).
   - `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v` if `v > z - y` is `True`, otherwise `1`.

3. **Calculations:**
   - Let's assume `v` is a specific value, say `v = y - x`.
   - `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`:
     - If `v > x - w` is `True`, then `v ** (v > x - w)` is `v`.
     - If `v > x - w` is `False`, then `v ** (v > x - w)` is `1`.
   - `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`:
     - If `v > z - y` is `True`, then `v ** (v > z - y)` is `v`.
     - If `v > z - y` is `False`, then `v ** (v > z - y)` is `1`.

4. **Appending to `b`:**
   - `b` will be extended by the results of the above expressions.

### Final Output State:
- `a` remains `-1000000000.0`
- `c` and `d` remain the new values returned by the function `r()`
- `b` is updated to `[0, 0, 0 + v ** (v > x - w), 0 + v ** (v > z - y)]`
- `n`, `m`, `queries`, and `u` remain unchanged
- `u` remains `0` (falsy value)
- `c` is less than `d` if the new `c` is less than the new `d`; otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `v` remains `y - x`

### Simplified Output State:
- `a` is `-1000000000.0`
- `c` and `d` are the new values returned by the function `r()`
- `b` is `[0, 0, v ** (v > x - w), v ** (v > z - y)]`
- `n`, `m`, `queries`, and `u` remain unchanged
- `u` is `0` (falsy value)
- `c` is less than `d` if the new `c` is less than the new `d`; otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `v` is `y - x`

Output State: **`a` is `-1000000000.0`, `c` and `d` are the new values returned by the function `r()`, `b` is `[0, 0, v ** (v > x - w), v ** (v > z - y)]`, `n`, `m`, `queries`, and `u` remain unchanged, `u` is `0` (falsy value), `c` is less than `d` if the new `c` is less than the new `d`; otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, `t` is `t - 1`, `v` is `y - x`.**
