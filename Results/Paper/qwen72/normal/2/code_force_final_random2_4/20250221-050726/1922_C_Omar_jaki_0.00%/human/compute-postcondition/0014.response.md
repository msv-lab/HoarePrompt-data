The value of `v` is assigned the result of `y - x`. Since `y` and `x` are elements from the pairs in the `queries` list, `v` will be the difference between these two values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9 and the remaining length of `a` must be at least 4, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, `b` is `[0, 0, y - x, y - x + v]`, `v` is `y - x`.**
