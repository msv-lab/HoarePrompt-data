Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The function `func_1` generates a string by repeating the first `k` letters of the alphabet `n` times. This approach does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters are included in the resulting string `s`.

For example, for the input `(n=2, k=2)`, the expected output should be a string like "baab" which includes all possible subsequences of length 2 using the letters 'a' and 'b'. However, the provided function would generate "aabb", which does not include the subsequence "ba".

A correct solution would need to construct a string that ensures all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters are present, and this is not achieved by simply repeating the first `k` letters `n` times.
