Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`. The goal is to minimize the length of `s`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It constructs a string `s` by taking the first `k` characters from the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` and repeating this substring `n` times.
   - Finally, it returns the constructed string `s`.

3. **Evaluating the Logic**:
   - The string `s` is constructed by repeating the first `k` characters `n` times. This means the string `s` will be of length `k * n`.
   - For a string of length `n` to be a subsequence of `s`, every possible combination of `n` characters from the first `k` characters must appear in `s` in some order.
   - Repeating the first `k` characters `n` times ensures that every possible combination of `n` characters from the first `k` characters will appear as a subsequence in `s`.

4. **Checking for Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the output is `ab`, which is correct because both `a` and `b` are subsequences.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the output is `aa`, which is correct because `aa` is the only possible string.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the output is `baab`, which is correct because `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, and `bb` are all subsequences.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the output is `abcbac`, which is correct because all combinations of `aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, and `cc` are subsequences.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic of constructing the string `s` by repeating the first `k` characters `n` times ensures that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters are subsequences of `s`.
   - The solution meets the requirements of the problem and handles the edge cases correctly.
