The code snippet converts the `permutation` list into a string where each element is separated by a space. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `k`, `curr_v`, `idx`, or `idx_v`. However, it introduces a new variable `result` that holds the string representation of the `permutation` list.

Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `k` remain integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even. The `permutation` list of length `n` is filled such that for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`, the elements at indices `i, i+k, i+2*k, ...` up to the last valid index are set to consecutive integers starting from `1`. The variable `curr_v` is now equal to `n + (n // k)`, which is the total number of elements filled in the `permutation` list. The variables `idx` and `idx_v` remain unchanged at 0 and 1, respectively. `result` is a string containing the elements of the `permutation` list separated by spaces.**
