The code snippet increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`. Given that the initial value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + 2 * k`, after the increment, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes `1 + 3 * k`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i * k]` is set to `i + 1` for all valid `i` (i.e., `i * k < n`), `permutation[1]` is `curr_v`, `permutation[1 + k]` is `curr_v`, `permutation[1 + 2 * k]` is `(n // k) + 3`, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `(n // k) + 4`, `i` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + 3 * k`.**
