Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of generating a k-level permutation for a given n and k, where k is even. Let's break down the components and their roles:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - Initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` filled with zeros.
   - Fills the `permutation` list such that for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`, the elements at indices `i, i+k, i+2*k, ...` are set to consecutive integers starting from 1.
   - Prints the resulting permutation as a space-separated string.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases.
   - Calls `func_1` exactly `t` times, handling multiple test cases.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Permutation Construction**:
  - The function constructs the permutation by placing consecutive integers in a pattern that ensures the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by at most 1.
  - By distributing the integers in a cyclic manner (i.e., filling indices `i, i+k, i+2*k, ...`), it ensures that the sums of these segments are balanced.

- **Correctness**:
  - The approach of filling the permutation in a cyclic manner is a known method to ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` are balanced.
  - This method guarantees that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any segment of length `k` is at most 1, meeting the definition of a k-level permutation.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
  - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - This ensures that the program can handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
- Both functions work together to solve the problem correctly.
- `func_1` generates a valid k-level permutation for each test case.
- `func_2` handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1`.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions.

Correctness: **True**
