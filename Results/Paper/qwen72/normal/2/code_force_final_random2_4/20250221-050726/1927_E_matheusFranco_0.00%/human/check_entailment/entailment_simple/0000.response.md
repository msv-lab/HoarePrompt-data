Reasoning:

The program aims to generate a k-level permutation for given values of `n` and `k`, where `k` is even. A k-level permutation is defined such that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any contiguous subarray of length `k` is at most 1.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
1. **Input Reading**: The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
2. **Permutation Initialization**: It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
3. **Filling the Permutation**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
   - For each `i`, it fills the positions `i, i+k, i+2*k, ...` in the `permutation` list with consecutive integers starting from `1`.
   - This ensures that the permutation is constructed in a way that the sums of contiguous subarrays of length `k` will have minimal differences.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
1. **Reading Test Cases**: The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: It loops `t` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.
3. **Decrementing `t`**: After each call to `func_1()`, it decrements `t` until `t` reaches 0.

### Verification of the Permutation:
- The construction method ensures that the sums of contiguous subarrays of length `k` will be very close to each other, differing by at most 1.
- This is because the elements are distributed evenly across the permutation, ensuring that the sums of the subarrays are balanced.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge cases where `n` and `k` are at their minimum and maximum values within the given constraints.
- The program guarantees that the permutation is valid and meets the k-level condition.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a k-level permutation for the given inputs and follows the problem's constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
