### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to generate a permutation of length `n` that is `k-level`, meaning the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any contiguous subarray of length `k` should be at most 1.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - Reads `n` and `k` from input.
     - Initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
     - Uses a nested loop to fill the `permutation` list:
       - The outer loop iterates over the first `k` indices.
       - The inner loop fills the `permutation` list at positions that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i`.
       - The value `curr_v` is incremented and assigned to the appropriate position in the `permutation` list.
     - Converts the `permutation` list to a string and prints it.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Permutation Generation:**
     - The code generates a permutation by filling the list in a specific pattern.
     - The pattern ensures that the values are distributed in a way that the sums of contiguous subarrays of length `k` are balanced.
     - Specifically, the code fills the permutation in a cyclic manner, ensuring that the values are spread out evenly.

   - **K-Level Condition:**
     - The key idea is to distribute the values in such a way that the sums of contiguous subarrays of length `k` are as close as possible.
     - By filling the permutation in a cyclic manner, the code ensures that the sums of these subarrays are balanced, satisfying the `k-level` condition.
     - The cyclic filling method ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any contiguous subarray of length `k` is at most 1.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the constraints well, including the upper limits for `n` and `k`.
   - The code correctly processes multiple test cases as specified.

5. **Verification Using Annotations:**
   - The annotations confirm that the `permutation` list is filled in a cyclic manner, ensuring that the values are distributed evenly.
   - The final state of the `permutation` list after the loops confirms that it meets the `k-level` condition.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly generates a `k-level` permutation for the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
