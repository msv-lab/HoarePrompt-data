Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i * k]` is set to `i + 1` for all valid `i` (i.e., `i * k < n`), `permutation[1]` is `curr_v`, `permutation[1 + k]` is `curr_v + 1`, `permutation[1 + 2 * k]` is `curr_v + 2`, ..., `permutation[n - 1]` is the final value of `curr_v`, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n`, `i` is 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `multiples_of_k_plus_i = i` updates the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` to the value of `i`. Since `i` is 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
