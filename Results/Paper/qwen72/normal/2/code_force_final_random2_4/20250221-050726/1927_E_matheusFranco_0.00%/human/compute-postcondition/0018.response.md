The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k`. Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` was initially `3 * k`, after adding `k` to it, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes `4 * k`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` with `permutation[0]` set to 1, `permutation[k]` set to 2, and `permutation[3 * k]` set to 3, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is 4, `i` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `4 * k` and `4 * k` must be less than `len(permutation)`**
