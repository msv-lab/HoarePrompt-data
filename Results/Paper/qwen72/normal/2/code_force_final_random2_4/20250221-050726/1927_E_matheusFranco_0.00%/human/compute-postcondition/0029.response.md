The value of `curr_v` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `curr_v` was `(n // k) + 2`, so the new value of `curr_v` is `(n // k) + 3`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i * k]` is set to `i + 1` for all valid `i` (i.e., `i * k < n`), `permutation[1]` is `curr_v`, `permutation[1 + k]` is `curr_v`, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `(n // k) + 3`, `i` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + k`.**
