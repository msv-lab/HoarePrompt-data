The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If `lst` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`, and `final` is an empty list. For the loop to execute, `lst` must have at least one element, and `elem` should be the first element in `lst`.

State: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`, `final` is an empty list, `lst` must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`**
