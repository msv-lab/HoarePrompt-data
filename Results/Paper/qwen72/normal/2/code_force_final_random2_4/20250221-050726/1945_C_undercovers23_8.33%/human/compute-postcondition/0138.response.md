Output State: **`mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. The length of `final` is 1. `c1` is equal to `o * 100 // n`. Additionally, `c1` is less than 50. `final` now contains the element `n`.**
