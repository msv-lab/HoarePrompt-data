To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `lst`.

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `lst` is not empty.
- The variable `elem` will take on values from `lst` during each iteration of the loop.

### Given State:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `s` is an input string
- `pk` is `n // 2`
- `sl` is a list of characters from `s`
- `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`
- `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`
- `mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character
- `one` is the total number of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character
- `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`
- `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (n - 2) - 1))`
- `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were greater than or equal to 50 during the loop execution
- `final` is an empty list

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element.
- The variable `elem` will be set to the first element of `lst` when the loop starts.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character, `one` is the total number of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (n - 2) - 1))`, `lst` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`, `final` is an empty list**
