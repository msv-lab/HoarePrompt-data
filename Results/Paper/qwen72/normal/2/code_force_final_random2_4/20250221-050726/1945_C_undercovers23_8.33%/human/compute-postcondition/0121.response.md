The only objects in the loop head are the variable `elem` and the list `lst`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element. Before the loop starts, `mini` being the minimum absolute difference and `final` being an empty list do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they provide context for what happens within the loop.

For the loop to execute, `lst` must have at least one element, and `elem` should be set to the first element of `lst`.

State: **`mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`, `lst` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`, `final` is an empty list**
