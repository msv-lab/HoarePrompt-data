Postcondition: ***`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`, `final` is an empty list unless the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element `elem` of `lst` is equal to `mini`, in which case `final` contains the first element of `lst`. `lst` has at least 1 element, and `elem` is the first element in `lst`.***
