Precondition: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4. For each test case, n is an integer representing the number of houses, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**
