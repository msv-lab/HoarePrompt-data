Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`. `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. The length of `final` is equal to the number of such elements in `lst`.**

Explanation:
- After the loop has executed all its iterations, `mini` remains the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`.
- The list `final` will contain all elements from `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`.
- If no elements in `lst` have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`, `final` will be an empty list.
- If there are multiple elements in `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`, `final` will contain all of these elements.
