Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided solution has a few issues that prevent it from being correct according to the problem statement. Here are the main points:

1. **Percentage Calculation**: The code calculates the percentage of zeros and ones on each side of the road using `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))` and `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. However, the problem requires checking if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied, not their percentage. This means the conditions should be:
   - For the left side: `zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2)`
   - For the right side: `(o - one) >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2)`

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not handle the edge cases correctly. Specifically, it does not check if laying the road before the first house (i.e., `i = 0`) or after the last house (i.e., `i = n`) satisfies the conditions. These edge cases need to be explicitly checked.

3. **Final Answer Selection**: The code attempts to find the position closest to the middle of the village, but it does not handle the case where multiple positions have the same distance to the middle. It should select the smallest index in such cases.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        
        # Count total zeros and ones
        o = s.count('1')
        z = s.count('0')
        
        # Initialize prefix sums for zeros and ones
        zero = 0
        one = 0
        
        # List to store valid positions
        valid_positions = []
        
        # Check all possible positions for the road
        for i in range(n):
            if i > 0:
                if s[i-1] == '0':
                    zero += 1
                else:
                    one += 1
            
            # Calculate the number of zeros and ones on each side
            left_zeros = zero
            left_ones = i - zero
            right_zeros = z - zero
            right_ones = o - one
            
            # Check if the current position satisfies the condition
            if left_zeros >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2) and right_ones >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
                valid_positions.append(i)
        
        # Handle edge cases
        if len(valid_positions) == 0:
            if o >= math.ceil(n / 2):
                valid_positions.append(0)
            else:
                valid_positions.append(n)
        
        # Find the position closest to the middle
        pk = n // 2
        valid_positions.sort(key=lambda x: (abs(x - pk), x))
        
        print(valid_positions[0])

func()
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned and should work correctly for the given problem.
