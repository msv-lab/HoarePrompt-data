Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is `100000000`, `i` is 1, `zero` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `one` is 0 if `s[0]` is '0' and 1 otherwise, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / 2)`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - 2))`, `lst` is an empty list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `z` is the count of '0' in `sl`.**

Explanation:
- `zero_perc` is updated to `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, which simplifies to `math.ceil(zero * 100 / 2)` because `i` is 1.
- `one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, which simplifies to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - 2))` because `i` is 1.
- `lst` remains an empty list since no conditions are met to add elements to it.
- `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, but since `lst` is empty, `final` remains an empty list.
- `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.
- `z` is updated to the count of '0' in `sl`, but since `sl` is already defined as a list of characters from `s`, `z` remains the same.
