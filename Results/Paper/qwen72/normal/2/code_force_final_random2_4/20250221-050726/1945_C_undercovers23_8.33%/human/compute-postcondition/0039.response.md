Output State: **`one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 2, `zero` is 3 or 2, `one` is 1 or 2, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, and `lst` is a list containing `[1, 2]` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `one_perc` to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `mini`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `lst`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `one_perc` depends on the current values of `o`, `one`, `n`, and `i`. The exact value of `one_perc` is calculated using the formula provided.
- The conditions for `lst` being `[1, 2]` or remaining an empty list are still based on the values of `zero_perc` and the newly updated `one_perc`.
