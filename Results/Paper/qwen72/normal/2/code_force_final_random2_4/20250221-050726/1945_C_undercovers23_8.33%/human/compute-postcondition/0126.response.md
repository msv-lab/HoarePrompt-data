Output State: **`mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`, `lst` must contain at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `lst`, `final` is a list containing `[first element in lst, elem]` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst` is equal to `mini`; otherwise, `final` is a list containing `[elem]`.** 

Explanation: The code appends `elem` (which is the second element in `lst`) to the list `final`. If `final` was initially an empty list, it now contains only `[elem]`. If `final` initially contained the first element in `lst` because the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst` was equal to `mini`, then `final` now contains both the first element in `lst` and `elem`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
