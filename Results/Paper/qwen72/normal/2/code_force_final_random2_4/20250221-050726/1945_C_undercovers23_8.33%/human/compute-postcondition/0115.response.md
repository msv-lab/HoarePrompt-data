The only object in the loop head is the variable `ele` and the list `lst`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If `lst` contains at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` must contain at least one element, and `ele` was the last element processed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must contain at least two elements (since one has already been processed), and `ele` will be the next element in the list.

State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the last `ele`, `lst` must contain at least two elements, `ele` is the next element in the list**
