To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2·10^4.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
