Reasoning:

The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading an integer `n` that specifies the size of the checkerboard to generate. The program uses a series of `if-elif-else` statements to handle different values of `n`. For `n` values of 1, 2, 3, and 4, the program prints the corresponding checkerboard pattern. However, the program does not correctly handle values of `n` greater than 4, as it prints "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in the range") instead of generating the appropriate checkerboard pattern.

According to the problem description, the program should be able to handle any `n` in the range 1 to 20, and it should generate the checkerboard pattern for all these values. The current implementation only handles specific cases (1, 2, 3, and 4) and fails to generate the pattern for other valid values of `n`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
