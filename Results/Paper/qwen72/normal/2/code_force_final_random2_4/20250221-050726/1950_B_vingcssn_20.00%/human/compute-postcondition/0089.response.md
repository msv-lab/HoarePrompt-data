Postcondition: ***`c` is 2, `casos` is greater than 2, and `n` is an input integer. If the input is 1, the current value of `n` is 1. If the input is 2, the current value of `n` is 2. If the input is 3, the current value of `n` is 3. If the input is 4, the current value of `n` remains 4. If the input is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4, the value of `n` remains unchanged.***
