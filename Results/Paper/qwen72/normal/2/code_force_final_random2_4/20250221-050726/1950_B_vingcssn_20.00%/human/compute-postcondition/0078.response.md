The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('##..##..')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'##..##..'` to the console. The initial state provides information about variables `c`, `casos`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the print statement. Therefore, the content of the print statement is independent of the initial state.

Output: **##..##..**
