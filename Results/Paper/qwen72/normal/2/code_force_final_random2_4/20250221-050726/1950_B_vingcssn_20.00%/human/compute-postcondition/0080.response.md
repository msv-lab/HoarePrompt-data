The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('..##..##')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'..##..##'`.

Therefore, regardless of the values of `c`, `casos`, or `n`, the output will always be the same.

Output: **..##..##**
