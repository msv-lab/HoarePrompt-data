The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, which determines the size of the checkerboard to be generated. The function should read the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) from the input, followed by `t` lines, each containing a single integer `n`.
