Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is 0.
- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4.

The print statement is:
```python
print('No esta en el rango')
```

This statement does not depend on any variables or conditions other than the fact that `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the precondition explicitly states that `n` is not equal to these values, the print statement will always execute and print the string 'No esta en el rango'.

Output: **No esta en el rango**
