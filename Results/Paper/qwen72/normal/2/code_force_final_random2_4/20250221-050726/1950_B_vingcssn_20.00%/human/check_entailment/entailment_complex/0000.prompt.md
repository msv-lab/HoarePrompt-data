Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, which determines the size of the checkerboard to be generated. The function should read the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) from the input, followed by `t` lines, each containing a single integer `n`.
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')
        
    #State: `c` is `casos - 1`, `casos` is the number of test cases provided by the user, and `n` is the last input integer provided by the user. If the last input `n` is 1, the current value of `n` is 1. If the last input `n` is 2, the current value of `n` is 2. If the last input `n` is 3, the current value of `n` is 3. If the last input `n` is 4, the current value of `n` remains 4. If the last input `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4, the value of `n` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, where each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 4). For each test case, it prints a checkerboard pattern of size `n x n` using `#` and `.` characters. If `n` is outside the range of 1 to 4, it prints "No esta en el rango". After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state of the program is that all specified checkerboard patterns have been printed to the console.
