The only variables in the loop head are `c` and `casos`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `c` being less than `casos`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 1 and `casos` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 2), and `casos` must still be greater than `c`.

State: **`c` is 2, `casos` is greater than 2, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the current value of `n` is 1. If `n` is 2, the current value of `n` is 2. If `n` is 3, the current value of `n` is 3. If `n` is 4, the current value of `n` remains 4. If `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4, the value of `n` remains unchanged.**
