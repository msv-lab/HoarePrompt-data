The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs a fixed string:

```python
print('..##')
```

Based on the initial state:
- `c` is 0.
- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer and is not equal to 1.
- The current value of `n` is 2.

None of these variables or conditions affect the `print` statement, as it simply prints a hardcoded string. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **..##**
