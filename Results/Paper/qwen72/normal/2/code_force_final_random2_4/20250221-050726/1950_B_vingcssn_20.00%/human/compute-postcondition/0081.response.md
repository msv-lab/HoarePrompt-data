The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('##..##..')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides information about the variables `c`, `casos`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement simply prints a fixed string: `'##..##..'`.

### Explanation:
- Regardless of the values of `c`, `casos`, or `n`, the `print` statement will always print the same string because it does not depend on any of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **##..##..**
