The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, where each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 4). For each test case, it prints a checkerboard pattern of size `n x n` using `#` and `.` characters. If `n` is outside the range of 1 to 4, it prints "No esta en el rango". After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state of the program is that all specified checkerboard patterns have been printed to the console.
