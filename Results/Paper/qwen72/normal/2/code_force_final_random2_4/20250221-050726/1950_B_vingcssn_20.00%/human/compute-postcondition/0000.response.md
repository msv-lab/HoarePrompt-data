Output State: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, which determines the size of the checkerboard to be generated. The variable `casos` is now an integer representing the number of test cases, and its value is the input provided by the user.**
