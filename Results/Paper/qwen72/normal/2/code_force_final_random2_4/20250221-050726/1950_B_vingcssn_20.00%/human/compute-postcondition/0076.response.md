The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string `'##..##'`. The initial state describes the values of `c`, `casos`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the content of the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `c`, `casos`, or `n`.

Given this, the output of the `print` statement will always be the same, regardless of the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **##..##**
