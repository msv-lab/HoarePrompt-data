The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user to determine the number of test cases `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), which represents the size of a checkerboard to be generated. The function then generates a checkerboard of size `n x n` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the size of a checkerboard. It then generates a checkerboard of size `n x n` for each test case.**
