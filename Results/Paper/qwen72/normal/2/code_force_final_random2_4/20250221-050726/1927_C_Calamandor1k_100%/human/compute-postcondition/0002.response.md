The code snippet creates a set `unique_a` from the list `a`. This means that `unique_a` will contain only the unique elements from `a`, and the order of these elements is not preserved.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `cases` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple (n, m, k, a, b) where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), k is even, a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), b is a list of m integers (1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6)
- `results` is an empty list

After executing the code snippet:
- `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`.

The values of `t`, `cases`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple (n, m, k, a, b) where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), k is even, a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), b is a list of m integers (1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6), `results` is an empty list, `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`.**
