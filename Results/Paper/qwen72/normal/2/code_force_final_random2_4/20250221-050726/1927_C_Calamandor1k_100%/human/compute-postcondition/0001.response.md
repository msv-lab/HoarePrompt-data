To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects directly involved in the loop head, which are `(n, m, k, a, b)` from the list `cases`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop iterates over tuples `(n, m, k, a, b)` from the list `cases`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, the list `cases` must contain at least one tuple.
3. **Initial State**: The initial state provided is that `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `cases` is a list of tuples. The list `results` is empty.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`cases`**: The list `cases` must contain at least one tuple for the loop to execute.
- **Tuple Elements**: Each tuple in `cases` should follow the given constraints: `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5`, `2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m)`, and `k` is even. The lists `a` and `b` should have lengths `n` and `m` respectively, and their elements should satisfy `1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6`.

### Final State:
To ensure the loop executes, the list `cases` must have at least one valid tuple, and the other variables (`t` and `results`) remain as they are.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple (n, m, k, a, b) where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), k is even, a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), b is a list of m integers (1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6), and `results` is an empty list.**
