You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n, m, and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and k is even), followed by two lists of integers a and b (1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6) of lengths n and m respectively.
def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:
        unique_a = set(a)
        
        unique_b = set(b)
        
        relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}
        
        relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}
        
        only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b
        
        only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a
        
        both = relevant_a & relevant_b
        
        if len(only_a) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        if len(only_b) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)
        
        if total_distinct < k:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        results.append('YES')
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples containing `t` tuples (n, m, k, a, b), `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple in `cases` based on the conditions checked in the loop. For each tuple, `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, and `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple in `cases`. Each 'YES' or 'NO' indicates whether the conditions checked in the loop for the corresponding tuple (n, m, k, a, b) were met. The conditions involve checking the unique elements in lists `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`, and ensuring the total number of distinct elements (those only in `a`, only in `b`, or in both) meets certain criteria.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. For each tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` in `cases`, it checks if the conditions involving the unique elements in lists `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and the total number of distinct elements meet certain criteria. It returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple, indicating whether the conditions were met.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple in `cases`. Each 'YES' or 'NO' indicates whether the conditions checked in the loop for the corresponding tuple (n, m, k, a, b) were met. The conditions involve checking the unique elements in lists `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`, and ensuring the total number of distinct elements (those only in `a`, only in `b`, or in both) meets certain criteria.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
