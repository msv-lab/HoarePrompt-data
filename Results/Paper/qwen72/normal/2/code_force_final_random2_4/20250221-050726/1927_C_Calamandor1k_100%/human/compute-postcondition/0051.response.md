Output State: **All variables (`t`, `cases`, `results`, `unique_a`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `only_b`, `both`, `total_distinct`, `unique_b`) retain their initial values, and the program continues to the next iteration or statement.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration or statement. This means that none of the variables are modified by the `continue` statement. Therefore, all the initial conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
