You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k
.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \frac{k}{2}
elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every
integer from 1 to k is included.

For example:

  * If a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5] , k=6 , then it is possible to choose elements with values 2, 3, 6 from array a and elements with values 1, 4, 5 from array b . In this case, all numbers from 1 to k=6 will be included among the chosen elements.
  * If a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3] , k=6 , then it is not possible to choose elements in the required way. 

Note that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements — your
program should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the
required way.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n, m \le 2\cdot10^5 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot \min(n, m) , k is even) — the length
of array a , the length of array b , and the number of elements to be chosen,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_j \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test
does not exceed 4 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to choose \frac{k}{2} numbers from
each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1
to k is included. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

Note

In the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 2 , 3 , and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1 , 4 , and 5 from array b
. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.

In the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not
possible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.

In the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b . Thus, all
numbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.

    #State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples containing `t` tuples (n, m, k, a, b), `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple in `cases` based on the conditions checked in the loop. For each tuple, `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, and `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple in `cases`. Each 'YES' or 'NO' indicates whether the conditions checked in the loop for the corresponding tuple (n, m, k, a, b) were met. The conditions involve checking the unique elements in lists `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`, and ensuring the total number of distinct elements (those only in `a`, only in `b`, or in both) meets certain criteria.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases` as input. Each tuple in `cases` consists of five elements: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is an even integer, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers. The function evaluates each tuple to determine if the conditions related to the unique elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k` are met. Specifically, it checks if the number of unique elements in `a` and `b` that are not shared and the number of shared elements together meet the criteria defined by `k`. The function returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple, indicating whether the conditions were met for that tuple.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the lengths of the arrays `n` and `m`, the value of `k`, and the elements of the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Set Operations**: The program uses sets to efficiently handle the unique elements in arrays `a` and `b`. It then filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Set Differences and Intersections**: The program calculates the elements that are unique to `a` (`only_a`), unique to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`).

4. **Conditions for Validity**:
   - It checks if the number of unique elements in `only_a` exceeds `k // 2`. If so, it returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the number of unique elements in `only_b` exceeds `k // 2`. If so, it returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the total number of distinct elements (sum of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) is less than `k`. If so, it returns 'NO'.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

5. **Output**: The program outputs the results for each test case as specified.

The logic ensures that the program correctly determines whether it is possible to choose exactly `k // 2` elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to `k` are included. The program handles edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
