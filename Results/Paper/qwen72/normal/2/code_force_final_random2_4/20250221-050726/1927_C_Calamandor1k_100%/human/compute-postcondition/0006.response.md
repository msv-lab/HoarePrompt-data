The code `only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b` creates a new set `only_a` that contains elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `cases` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple (n, m, k, a, b)
- `results` is an empty list
- `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`
- `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`
- `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`
- `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`

After executing the code:
- `only_a` is now a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple (n, m, k, a, b), `results` is an empty list, `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`.**
