Output State: **All variables remain unchanged, but the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop body and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, all the initial conditions and variable values remain the same. The only change is that the program's control flow moves to the next iteration or the next statement outside the loop.
