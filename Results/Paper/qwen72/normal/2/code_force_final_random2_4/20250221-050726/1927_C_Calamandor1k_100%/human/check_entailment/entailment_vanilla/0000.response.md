### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then reads the input for each test case, storing the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the arrays `a` and `b` in a list of tuples called `cases`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` to store the unique elements from arrays `a` and `b`, respectively.

3. **Relevant Elements:**
   - The program creates sets `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` to store elements from `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.
   - It then calculates the elements that are unique to `a` (`only_a`), unique to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`).

4. **Conditions for Validity:**
   - The program checks if the number of unique elements in `only_a` is greater than `k // 2`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results and continues to the next test case.
   - Similarly, it checks if the number of unique elements in `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results and continues to the next test case.
   - It then checks if the total number of distinct elements (sum of unique elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) is less than `k`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results and continues to the next test case.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it appends 'YES' to the results.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose exactly `k/2` elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to `k` is included. The conditions and logic used are appropriate for the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
