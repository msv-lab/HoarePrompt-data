The code snippet `a = a[::-1]` reverses the list `a`. This impacts the order of elements in `a` but does not change the values of other variables.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` remains the same
- `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], ..., (1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]) - T[n-2]]`
- `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces
- `t` is `0`
- `line` is the new input string
- `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the new `line` and converting each element to an integer

After executing the code:
- `a` is now reversed, so the new `a` is `[(1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]) - T[n-2], ..., (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], 1000 - T[0], 1000]`

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` remains the same, `a` is `[(1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]) - T[n-2], ..., (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], 1000 - T[0], 1000]`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `0`, `line` is the new input string, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the new `line` and converting each element to an integer.**
