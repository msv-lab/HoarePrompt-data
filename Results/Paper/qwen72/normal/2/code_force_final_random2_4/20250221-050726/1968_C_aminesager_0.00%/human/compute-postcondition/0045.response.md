Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` remains the same, `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], ..., (1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]) - T[n-2]]`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `0`, `line` is the new input string, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the new `line` and converting each element to an integer.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: The list `a` starts with `[1000]`. For each iteration `i` from `1` to `n-1`, the loop appends the value `a[i-1] - T[i-1]` to the list `a`. Therefore, the final list `a` will contain `n` elements, where each element is derived from the previous element minus the corresponding element in `T`.
- **`result`**: The variable `result` is a string that contains the elements of `a` separated by spaces. This string will reflect the final state of the list `a` after the loop has completed.
- **`t`**: The variable `t` remains `0` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`line`**: The variable `line` remains the new input string as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`T`**: The variable `T` remains the list of integers obtained by splitting the new `line` and converting each element to an integer, as it is not modified within the loop.
