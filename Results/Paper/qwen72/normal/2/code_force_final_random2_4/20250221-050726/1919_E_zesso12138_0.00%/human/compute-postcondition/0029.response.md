Initial State: `results` must be a non-empty list

Given the initial state, we know that `results` is a list and it is guaranteed to contain at least one element. However, the specific content of the list is not provided.

The code snippet:
```python
print(res)
```

Here, the variable `res` is referenced in the `print` statement, but it is not defined in the initial state or within the code snippet itself. This means that `res` is undefined, and attempting to print an undefined variable will result in a `NameError`.

Therefore, the output will be an error message indicating that `res` is not defined.

Output: **NameError: name 'res' is not defined**
