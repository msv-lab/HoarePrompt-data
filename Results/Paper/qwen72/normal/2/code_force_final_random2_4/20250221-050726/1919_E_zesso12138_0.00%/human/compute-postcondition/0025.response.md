Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (greater than 0) - 2, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers extracted from `data[index:index + n]` and converted to integers, `data` is a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `index` is 4 + 3 * `n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` and the new `result` value, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `result` is updated to the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`.
- The list `results` now contains the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` and the new `result` value, which are the same.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `data`, `index`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
