Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1 initialized with all elements set to 0 except `dp[n]` which is set to 1, `offset` is equal to `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    for j in range(2 * n + 1):
        if dp[j] > 0:
            if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
            if j - 1 >= 0:
                new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
    dp = new_dp


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is now a list of length 2 * n + 1 where each element `dp[j]` is the sum of the number of ways to reach position `j - n` from position `0` using steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD, `offset` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1 where each element `new_dp[j]` is the sum of the number of ways to reach position `j - n` from position `0` using steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is still a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is now a list of length 2 * n + 1 where each element `dp[j]` represents the cumulative sum of the number of ways to reach position `j - n` from any position `k` in the previous `dp` using steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD, `offset` is still equal to `n`, `i` is still 2, and `new_dp` is no longer relevant as it has been assigned to `dp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is still a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is now a list of length 2 * n + 1 with values updated from `new_dp`, `offset` is still equal to `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1, and `j` is 2 * n.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
