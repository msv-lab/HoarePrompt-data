The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the loop control variable `t`, so we can only adjust these. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer (greater than 0) - 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (greater than 0) - 2, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers extracted from `data[index:index + n]` and converted to integers, `data` is a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `index` is 3 + 2 * `n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` and the new `result` value, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**
