Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers extracted from `data[2:2 + n]` and converted to integers, `data` is a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `index` is 2 + `n`, `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by `n`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `data`, `results`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `index` is `2 + n`.
