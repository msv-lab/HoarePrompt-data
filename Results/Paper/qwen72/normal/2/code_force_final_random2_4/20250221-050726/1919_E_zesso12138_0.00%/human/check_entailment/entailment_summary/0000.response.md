Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to count the number of possible arrays `a` consisting of 1s and -1s that, when their prefix sums are sorted, match the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to reach a specific position from the starting position (0) using exactly `n` steps, where each step can either be +1 or -1.
   - **State Representation**: The state `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to reach the position `j - n` after `i` steps.
   - **Transition**: For each step, the function updates the `dp` array to account for both possible moves (+1 and -1).
   - **Final Position Calculation**: The final position is determined by adding the last element of the list `p` to `n`.
   - **Modulo Operation**: The result is taken modulo `998244353` to handle large numbers.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
   - **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, it reads `n` and the list `p`, calls `func_1` with these parameters, and appends the result to a list.
   - **Output**: After processing all test cases, it prints each result.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **Input Validation**: The input is read correctly and split into individual test cases.
   - **Function Calls**: The function `func_1` is called correctly with the appropriate parameters.
   - **Output**: The results are printed correctly for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is appropriate for counting the number of valid arrays, and the input/output handling in `func_2` is correct.

Correctness: **True**
