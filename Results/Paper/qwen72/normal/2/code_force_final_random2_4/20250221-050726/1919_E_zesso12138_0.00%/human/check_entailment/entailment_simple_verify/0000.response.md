### Reasoning:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The `func_1` function uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to count the number of ways to form the prefix sums. The `dp` array is initialized with a single entry at the offset position, representing the starting point (0).
   - The DP table is updated iteratively for each step from 1 to `n`. For each step, the program calculates the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum by considering both adding 1 and subtracting 1 from the current prefix sum.

2. **Offset Handling**:
   - The `offset` variable is used to shift the indices of the `dp` array to handle negative prefix sums. This ensures that all indices in the `dp` array are non-negative, which is necessary for the array to function correctly.

3. **State Transition**:
   - The state transition logic is correctly implemented. For each position `i`, the program updates the `new_dp` array based on the previous state `dp`. This ensures that the number of ways to reach each prefix sum is correctly calculated.
   - The transitions are performed by adding the current value of `dp[j]` to `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]` (with appropriate bounds checks).

4. **Final Result Calculation**:
   - The final result is calculated by accessing the value in the `dp` array corresponding to the final prefix sum `p[-1]` plus the offset. This correctly reflects the number of ways to reach the final prefix sum.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - The `func_2` function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases. It splits the input into individual test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, storing the results and printing them at the end.
   - The input handling is robust and correctly parses the input format specified in the problem description.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as the smallest possible input (`n = 1`) and larger inputs within the constraints. It also correctly handles cases where the prefix sum array `p` is already sorted and valid.
   - The program correctly returns 0 for invalid cases, such as when the prefix sum array cannot be formed by any sequence of 1s and -1s.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the detailed analysis of the program, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the solution for the given problem and handles all edge cases and valid inputs as expected.

Final: **True**
