Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` is 0 (indicating all iterations have completed), `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` from the last iteration, `p` is a list of `n` integers extracted from `data[index:index + n]` and converted to integers from the last iteration, `data` remains a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `index` is equal to the length of `data`, `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.
Code of the loop:
for res in results:
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` must be a non-empty list

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` must be a list with at least one element remaining to iterate over

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` must be a list with at least one element remaining to iterate over




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
