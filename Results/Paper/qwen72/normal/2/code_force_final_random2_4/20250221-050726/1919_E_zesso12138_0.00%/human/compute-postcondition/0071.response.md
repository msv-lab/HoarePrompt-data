Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is still a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1, `offset` is still equal to `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1 initialized to all zeros except `new_dp[j + 1]` which is now `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, and `j` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.
- Since `j` is 2, `new_dp[3]` is updated to `(new_dp[3] + dp[2]) % MOD`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
