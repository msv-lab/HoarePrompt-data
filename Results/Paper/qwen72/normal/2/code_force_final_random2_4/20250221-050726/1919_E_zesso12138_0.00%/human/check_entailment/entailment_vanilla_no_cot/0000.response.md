Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: `func_1` uses a dynamic programming approach to count the number of ways to form the prefix sums that match the given sorted prefix sums `p`. The DP table `dp` keeps track of the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum at each step.

2. **Offset Handling**: The `offset` variable is used to handle negative indices in the DP table, ensuring that all indices are within the valid range.

3. **Transition Logic**: The transitions in the DP table are correctly implemented. For each element in the prefix sum array, the function updates the DP table by considering both adding 1 and subtracting 1 from the current prefix sum.

4. **Final Result Calculation**: The final result is obtained by looking up the value in the DP table corresponding to the last element of the sorted prefix sum array `p`.

5. **Input Handling**: `func_2` reads the input efficiently using `sys.stdin.read` and processes multiple test cases as required. It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case, storing the results and printing them at the end.

Given these points, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.
