Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (greater than 0) - 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers extracted from `data[index:index + n]` and converted to integers, `data` is a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `index` is 3 + `n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**

Explanation:
- The code `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` updates the value of `p`.
- `p` is now a list of `n` integers extracted from `data[index:index + n]` and converted to integers.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `data`, `index`, `results`, `result`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
