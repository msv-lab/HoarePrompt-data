The only object in the loop head is the variable `res` from the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the `results` list has at least one element remaining, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` must have had at least one element remaining to iterate over. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still have at least one element remaining, and the next element will be the new `res`.

State: **`results` must be a list with at least one element remaining to iterate over**
