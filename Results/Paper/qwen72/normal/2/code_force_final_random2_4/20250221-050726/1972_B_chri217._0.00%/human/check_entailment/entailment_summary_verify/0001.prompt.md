You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[1])
    s = data[2]
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    num_up = s.count('U')
    if num_up % 2 == 1:
        return 'YES'
    else:
        return 'NO'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input, where `s` is a sequence of characters "U" and "D" representing the states of coins. It counts the number of "U" characters in the string. If the count of "U" is odd, the function returns 'YES'. If the count of "U" is even, the function returns 'NO'. The function does not modify the input string `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic**:
   - The game involves removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins, and the player who cannot make a move loses.
   - The key observation is that the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always have the last move and win. If it is even, Bob will have the last move and win.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It processes each test case by extracting the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with the string `s` to determine the winner.
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of 'U' (facing-up coins) in the string `s`.
   - If the count of 'U' is odd, it returns 'YES' (Alice wins), otherwise, it returns 'NO' (Bob wins).

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the input data.
   - The indices for `n` and `s` are correctly used in the loop.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case as required.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as when there are no facing-up coins (returns 'NO') and when there is only one facing-up coin (returns 'YES').

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
