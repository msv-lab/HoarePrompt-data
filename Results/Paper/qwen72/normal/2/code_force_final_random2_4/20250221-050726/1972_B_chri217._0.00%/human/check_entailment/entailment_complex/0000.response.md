Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of the coins. The key insight here is that the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ("U") determines the outcome of the game when both players play optimally.

1. **Initial Configuration and Parity**:
   - If the number of "U" coins is odd, Alice will always have a move available when it's her turn, and she can force Bob into a position where he has no valid moves left. This is because removing an "U" coin and flipping its neighbors changes the parity of the number of "U" coins. Starting with an odd number of "U" coins means that after each move, the number of "U" coins will alternate between odd and even. Since Alice starts, she will always make the last move when the number of "U" coins is odd.

2. **Even Number of "U" Coins**:
   - Conversely, if the number of "U" coins is even, Bob will always have a move available when it's his turn, and he can force Alice into a position where she has no valid moves left. This is because starting with an even number of "U" coins means that after each move, the number of "U" coins will alternate between even and odd. Since Alice starts, she will eventually be forced to make the last move when the number of "U" coins is even, leaving Bob with the winning move.

3. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of "U" coins in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.
   - It then checks if the count of "U" coins is odd (`num_up % 2 == 1`). If it is, the function returns 'YES', indicating that Alice will win. Otherwise, it returns 'NO', indicating that Bob will win.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases align with the logic:
     - For `UUDUD` (3 "U" coins), the function should return 'YES' because 3 is odd.
     - For `UDDUD` (2 "U" coins), the function should return 'NO' because 2 is even.
     - For `UU` (2 "U" coins), the function should return 'NO' because 2 is even.

Given the above reasoning, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the coins.

Correctness: **True**
