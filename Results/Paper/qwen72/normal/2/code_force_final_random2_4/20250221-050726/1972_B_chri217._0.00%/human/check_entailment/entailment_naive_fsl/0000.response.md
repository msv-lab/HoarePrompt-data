Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on whether the number of facing-up coins (`num_up`) is odd or even. If `num_up` is odd, Alice will always win because she can always make the first move, and the parity of the number of facing-up coins will change after each move. If `num_up` is even, Bob will win because he will be the one to make the last move when there is an odd number of facing-up coins left.

The program reads the input correctly, processes each test case, and outputs the result based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. This logic aligns with the problem description and works for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
