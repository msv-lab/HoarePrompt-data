To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5.
- `a` is a list containing two elements where each element is a user input.
- `_` is 1.
- `s` is either an empty list or "a0cd".
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- If the second character of the first element of `a` is '1' and the first character of the second element of `a` is '0', then `s` is "a0cd" and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty list.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `n - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

### Adjustments:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

### Final State:
- `i` is incremented from 0 to 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` (which is now 1) must be less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two elements where each element is a user input, `_` is 1, `s` is either an empty list or "a0cd", `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 1, and `i` must be less than `n - 1`**.
