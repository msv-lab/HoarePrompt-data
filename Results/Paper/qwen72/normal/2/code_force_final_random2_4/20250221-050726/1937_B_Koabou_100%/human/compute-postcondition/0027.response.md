Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two elements where each element is a user input, `_` is 1, `s` is either an empty list or "a0cd" or `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`, `x` is 0 or 1, `i` is 1, and `i` must be less than `n - 1`. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', then `s` is set to `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`, `x` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged, `x` remains 0, and `y` remains 0.***
