The code snippet `a.append(input())` appends the user input to the list `a`. Since the initial state specifies that `a` is an empty list, after executing the code, `a` will contain one element which is the input provided by the user. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing one element which is the user input, `_` is 0 (loop counter)**
