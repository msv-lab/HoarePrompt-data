Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two elements where each element is a user input, `_` is 1, `s` is either an empty list or a concatenated string formed from parts of `a[0]` and `a[1]` based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is the index where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` was met, or `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking, `y` is the last index where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was met, or 0 if the condition was never met, `i` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, or the last value of `i` before the loop broke.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(y, x):
    if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
        t = x - i + 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two elements where each element is a user input, `_` is 1, `s` is either an empty list or a concatenated string formed from parts of `a[0]` and `a[1]` based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is at least 1, `y` is 0, `i` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, or the last value of `i` before the loop broke. If the substring `a[1][i:x]` is equal to the substring `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, then `t` is updated to `x - i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is 1 or `x - i + 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two elements where each element is a user input, `_` is 1, `s` is either an empty list or a concatenated string formed from parts of `a[0]` and `a[1]` based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is at least 1, `y` is 0, `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` was the last value before the loop broke or completed), and `i < x`. If `a[1][i:x]` is equal to `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, then `t` is set to `x - i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `t` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is either 1 or `x - i + 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two elements where each element is a user input, `_` is 1, `s` is either an empty list or a concatenated string formed from parts of `a[0]` and `a[1]` based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is at least 1, `y` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, and `i < x`. If `a[1][i:x]` is equal to `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, then `t` is set to `x - i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as per the original conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
