Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two elements where each element is a user input, `_` is 1, `s` is an empty list, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0, and the second character of the first element of `a` is '0', and the first character of the second element of `a` is '1'.**

Explanation: The code `y = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to `y`. Since `i` was already 0, `y` remains 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
