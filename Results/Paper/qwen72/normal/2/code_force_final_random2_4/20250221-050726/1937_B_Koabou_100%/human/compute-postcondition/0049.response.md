Postcondition: ***`t` is either 1 or `x - i + 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two elements where each element is a user input, `_` is 1, `s` is either an empty list or a concatenated string formed from parts of `a[0]` and `a[1]` based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is at least 1, `y` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, and `i < x`. If `a[1][i:x]` is equal to `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, then `t` is set to `x - i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as per the original conditions.***
