Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two elements where each element is a user input, `_` is 1, `i` is 2, and `i` must be less than `n - 1`. If `a[0][3]` is '1' and `a[1][2]` is '0', then `s` is set to `a[0][:3] + a[1][2:]`, `x` is set to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` remains as it was (either an empty list, "a0cd", or `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`), `x` remains 0 or 1, and `y` remains unchanged unless `a[0][3]` is '0' and `a[1][2]` is '1', in which case `y` is set to 2.***
