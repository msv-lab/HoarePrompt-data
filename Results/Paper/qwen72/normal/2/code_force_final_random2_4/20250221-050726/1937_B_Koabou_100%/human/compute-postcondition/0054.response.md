Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. It then searches for a specific pattern within these strings and constructs a new string `s` based on certain conditions. If a valid pattern is found, it calculates a value `t` based on the positions of the pattern. Finally, it prints the constructed string `s` and the calculated value `t`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. **
