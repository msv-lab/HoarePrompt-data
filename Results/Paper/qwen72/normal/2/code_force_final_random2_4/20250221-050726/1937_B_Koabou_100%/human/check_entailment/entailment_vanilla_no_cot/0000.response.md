Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Path Selection Logic**: The logic for determining the lexicographically smallest path is flawed. The code attempts to find a point where it should switch from the top row to the bottom row, but it does not correctly handle all possible scenarios, especially when there are multiple points where switching could result in a lexicographically smaller string.

2. **Path Count Calculation**: The way the number of paths yielding the smallest string is calculated is also incorrect. The variable `t` is used to count the number of such paths, but the logic for updating `t` is not correct and does not account for all possible paths that could lead to the same smallest string.

3. **String Construction**: The construction of the lexicographically smallest string `s` is not done in a way that ensures it is indeed the smallest possible string. The code only checks a limited set of conditions and does not consider all possible paths through the grid.

4. **Output Format**: The output format is incorrect. The `print(s, sep='')` should simply be `print(s)` since `sep` is used to specify the separator between items, which is not needed here.

To solve this problem correctly, a more robust approach would involve dynamic programming or a similar method to ensure that all possible paths are considered, and the lexicographically smallest string is found along with the number of paths that yield this string.
