The only objects in the loop head are the loop counter `_` and the range value `2`. The loop will execute a fixed number of times, specifically twice, as defined by `range(2)`. At the end of the first iteration, `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing one element which is the user input, `_` is 1**
