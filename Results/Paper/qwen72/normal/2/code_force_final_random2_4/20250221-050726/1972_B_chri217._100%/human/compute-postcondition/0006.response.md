The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer read from input (1 <= t <= 100), `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer read from the next line of input, and `s` is a string read from the next line of input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `_`.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input, 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer read from the next line of input, `s` is a string read from the next line of input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**
