The function `read_input` is intended to read input data for multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, followed by a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins (facing up or down). The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases.
