### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (func_1):**
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` in a list `cases`.
   - This part of the code accurately handles the input format as specified in the problem description.

2. **Game Logic (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` counts the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) in the string `s`.
   - It returns `'YES'` if the number of facing-up coins is odd, and `'NO'` if it is even.
   - The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins. This is because each move changes the parity of the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, the player whose turn it is can always make a move, ensuring they can force a win. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, the player whose turn it is will eventually be unable to make a move and will lose.

3. **Function Summary Verification:**
   - The function summary for `func_2` states that it returns `'YES'` if the number of 'U' characters in the string `case[1]` is even, and `'NO'` if the number of 'U' characters is odd. However, this is incorrect. The function actually returns `'YES'` if the number of 'U' characters is odd, and `'NO'` if it is even.
   - This discrepancy needs to be corrected in the function summary.

4. **Correctness of the Solution:**
   - Despite the incorrect function summary, the actual implementation of `func_2` is correct. It correctly identifies the winning condition based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
   - The implementation is straightforward and matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above. The function summary for `func_2` should be corrected to reflect the actual behavior of the function.

Final: **True**
