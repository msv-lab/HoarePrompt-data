The code snippet `cases.append((n, s))` appends a new tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `t` is an integer read from input, 1 <= t <= 100.
- `cases` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is `(n, s)` and the second tuple is also `(n, s)`.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is an integer read from the next line of input.
- `s` is a string read from the next line of input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `s` is now a new string read from the next line of input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `n` is now the integer value read from the next line of input.

After executing the code snippet, the list `cases` will have three tuples: the original two tuples and the newly appended tuple `(n, s)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is `(n, s)`, the second tuple is `(n, s)`, and the third tuple is `(n, s)`, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value read from the next line of input, `s` is a string read from the next line of input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**
