Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the winner of a game where players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins until no more moves are possible. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is even, Alice (the first player) will always have a move available when it's her turn, ensuring she can force a win. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Bob (the second player) will eventually be forced into a position where he cannot make a move, leading to his loss.

The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: This function reads the input and organizes it into a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing the number of coins (`n`) and the string representation of their states (`s`). The function correctly handles the input format and constraints.
2. `func_2`: This function determines the winner based on the number of facing-up coins. It counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` and returns 'YES' if the count is even, and 'NO' if the count is odd.

The logic in `func_2` is correct because:
- If the number of facing-up coins is even, Alice can always ensure that she leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob, forcing Bob into a losing position.
- If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Bob can always ensure that he leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Alice, forcing Alice into a losing position.

Given the problem's constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the program correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
