Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`; `max_profit` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
    profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
    max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
    if profit_next > profit_mid:
        low = mid + 1
    else:
        high = mid - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. `low` is either (0 + min(n, b)) // 2 + 1 if `profit_next` > `profit_mid`, or remains 0 otherwise. `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b` if `profit_next` > `profit_mid`, or is updated to `mid - 1` otherwise. `mid` is (0 + min(n, b)) // 2. `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, and `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. `max_profit` is the maximum of the original `max_profit` (which was 0) and `profit_mid`. If `profit_next` > `profit_mid`, `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`; otherwise, `profit_next` is less than or equal to `profit_mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. `low` is updated to either `mid + 1` if `profit_next` > `profit_mid`, or remains as (0 + min(n, b)) // 2 + 1 if `profit_next` <= `profit_mid`. `high` is updated to the minimum of `n` and `b` if `profit_next` > `profit_mid`, or to `mid - 1` if `profit_next` <= `profit_mid`. `mid` is updated to (low + high) // 2. `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`. `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. `max_profit` is the maximum of the original `max_profit` (which was 0) and `profit_mid`. If `profit_next` > `profit_mid`, `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`; otherwise, `profit_next` is less than or equal to `profit_mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, `profit_mid` is updated to `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is updated to `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, and `max_profit` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `profit_mid`. If `profit_next > profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
