The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. These parameters are integers with the constraint that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. The function returns the maximum profit (`max_profit`) encountered during the loop iterations, which is the highest value of `profit_mid` found while adjusting `low` and `high`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
