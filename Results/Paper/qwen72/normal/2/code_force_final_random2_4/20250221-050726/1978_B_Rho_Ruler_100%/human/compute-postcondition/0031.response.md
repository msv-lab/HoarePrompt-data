Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9) and returns the maximum profit (`max_profit`) calculated during a binary search process. The function iterates through possible values of `mid` between 0 and `min(n, b)`, using a helper function `func_1` to compute the profit at each step. The final `max_profit` is the highest profit value encountered during these iterations. The input parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution. **
