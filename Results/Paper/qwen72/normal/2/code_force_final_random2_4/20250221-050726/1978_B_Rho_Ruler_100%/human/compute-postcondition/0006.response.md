Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`; `mid` is (0 + min(n, b)) // 2; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b); `max_profit` is the maximum of the original `max_profit` (which was 0) and `profit_mid`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `max_profit` to be the maximum of its current value (which is 0) and `profit_mid`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `max_profit` is now the maximum of 0 and `profit_mid`.
