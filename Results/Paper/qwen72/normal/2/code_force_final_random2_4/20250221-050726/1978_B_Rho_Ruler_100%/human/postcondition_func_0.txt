The function `func_1` takes four parameters `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are non-negative integers with the constraints \( 0 \leq k \leq \min(n, b) \) and \( 1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^9 \). It calculates and returns a value based on the formula \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \). The final state of the program is that the function has returned this calculated value, and the input parameters remain unchanged.
