Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`; `max_profit` is 0; `mid` is (0 + min(n, b)) // 2; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`.**

Explanation:
- The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` remain within their specified ranges.
- `low` remains 0.
- `high` remains the minimum of `n` and `b`.
- `max_profit` remains 0.
- `mid` is calculated as `(0 + min(n, b)) // 2`.
- `profit_mid` is assigned the result of the function call `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`.
