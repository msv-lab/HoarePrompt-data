To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop condition:

- The loop condition is `low <= high`.
- Before the loop, `low` is 0 and `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`.

Given that `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^9\), and `low` is 0, we need to ensure that `low` (which is 0) is less than or equal to `high`.

Since `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, and both `n` and `b` are at least 1, the minimum of `n` and `b` will also be at least 1. Therefore, `high` will always be at least 1.

Thus, `low` (which is 0) is always less than or equal to `high` (which is at least 1). This means the loop condition `low <= high` will always be true for the first iteration.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`; `max_profit` is 0**
