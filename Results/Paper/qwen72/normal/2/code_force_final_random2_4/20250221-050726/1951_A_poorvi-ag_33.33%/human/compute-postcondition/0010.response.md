The code snippet `results.append('no')` adds the string `'no'` to the list `results`. Since `results` initially contains one element `'no'`, after executing this code, `results` will contain two elements, both being `'no'`.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing two elements 'no', `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string. The number of '1's in `arr` is exactly 2, and '11' is a substring of `arr`.**
