Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` is the total number of iterations and must be at least 1, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, and `results` contains `t` elements, each of which is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions described in the initial state. The loop has completed all iterations, and all elements in `results` have been printed.**
