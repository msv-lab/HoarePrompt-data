Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string. If the number of '1's in `arr` is even and `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' is a substring of `arr`, then `results` contains two elements 'no'. If the number of '1's in `arr` is even but does not meet the exact condition of having exactly two '1's and '11' being a substring, then `results` contains the string 'yes'. If the number of '1's in `arr` is not even, then `results` contains one element 'no'.***
