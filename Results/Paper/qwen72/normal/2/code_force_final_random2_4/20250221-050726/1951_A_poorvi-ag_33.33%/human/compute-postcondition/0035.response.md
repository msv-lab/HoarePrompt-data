Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `results` now contains one more element 'no' compared to its initial state.**

Explanation:
- The code `results.append('no')` adds the string 'no' to the list `results`.
- All other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged.
- The condition about `arr` containing exactly two '1's and '11' being a substring of `arr` does not affect the execution of the given code snippet. Therefore, the contents of `results` are updated regardless of this condition.
