Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values input during the `m` iterations, `m` is the number of iterations completed, `j` is `m - 1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the last set of input integers.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n` and `k`**: Remain as the integers provided by the user since they are not modified within the loop.
- **`sum_f`**: This variable accumulates the sum of all `f` values input during the `m` iterations of the loop.
- **`m`**: The loop runs `m` times, so `m` remains the same as the number of iterations.
- **`j`**: After the loop completes, `j` will be `m - 1` because the loop index starts from 0 and goes up to `m - 1`.
- **`a`, `b`, and `f`**: These variables are updated with the last set of input integers provided during the final iteration of the loop.
