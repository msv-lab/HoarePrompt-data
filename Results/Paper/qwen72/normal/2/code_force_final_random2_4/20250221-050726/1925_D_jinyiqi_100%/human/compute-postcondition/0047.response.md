Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is 0, `j` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `n * (n - 1) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`**

Explanation: The values of `a`, `b`, and `f` are updated to the input integers provided by the user. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
