Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `sum_f` is `f + f`, `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a`, `b`, and `f` are updated to new input integers.**

Explanation:
- The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `f`.
- The initial values of `a`, `b`, and `f` (which were previously input integers) are replaced by the new values read from the input.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `sum_f`, `m`, `j`) remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
