Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is 0, `j` is `m - 1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the last set of input integers, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `n * (n - 1) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `sum_f` is reset to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`) retain their initial values or expressions.
