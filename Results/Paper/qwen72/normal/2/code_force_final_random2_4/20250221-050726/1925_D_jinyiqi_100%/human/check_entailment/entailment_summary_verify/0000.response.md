### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen over `k` excursions. The key points are:
- There are `n` children and `m` pairs of friends.
- Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value `f_i`.
- The teacher chooses pairs randomly and independently for `k` excursions.
- If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen over `k` excursions.

#### Correct Formula
The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values is:
\[ E = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f_i + \frac{k - 1}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \]

Where:
- \( f_i \) is the initial friendship value of the i-th pair.
- \( \binom{n}{2} \) is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`, which is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

This formula accounts for the initial friendship value and the expected increase in friendship value over `k` excursions.

#### Program Analysis
The provided program calculates `p` and `q` as follows:
```python
p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)
q = 2 * cn2 ** 2
```

Let's break down these calculations:
- `cn2` is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`, which is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
- `sum_f` is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs.
- `p` is calculated as \( 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \).
- `q` is calculated as \( 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2 \).

The program then simplifies the fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \) and prints the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Comparison with Correct Formula
The correct formula for the expected value is:
\[ E = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f_i + \frac{k - 1}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \]

This can be rewritten as:
\[ E = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i + m \cdot \frac{k - 1}{\binom{n}{2}} \]

Comparing this with the program's formula:
- The term \( \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \) is correctly calculated as `sum_f`.
- The term \( m \cdot \frac{k - 1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) should be \( m \cdot \frac{k - 1}{\text{cn2}} \).

However, the program calculates:
\[ p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \]
\[ q = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \frac{p}{q} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2} \]
\[ = \frac{k \cdot \text{sum_f}}{\text{cn2}} + \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2} \]

This is not equivalent to the correct formula:
\[ E = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i + m \cdot \frac{k - 1}{\text{cn2}} \]

#### Conclusion
The program's formula for calculating the expected value is incorrect. The original assessment is accurate in stating that the program does not correctly handle the calculation of the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.

Final: **False**
