Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `sum_f` is `2 * f + f`, `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a`, `b`, and `f` are updated to new input integers.**

Explanation:
- `sum_f` was initially `f + f`, which simplifies to `2 * f`.
- The code `sum_f += f` adds the current value of `f` to `sum_f`.
- Therefore, `sum_f` is now `2 * f + f`, which simplifies to `3 * f`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `f`) remain unchanged, except that `a`, `b`, and `f` are updated to new input integers.
