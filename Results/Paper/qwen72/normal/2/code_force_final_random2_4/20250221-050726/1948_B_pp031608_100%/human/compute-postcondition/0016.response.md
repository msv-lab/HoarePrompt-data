Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `m - 2`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. The value of `arr[i - 1]` remains unchanged, and the value of `arr[i]` is less than the value of `arr[i - 1]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, no changes are made to `arr` or `ans`. `ans` is now False.**
