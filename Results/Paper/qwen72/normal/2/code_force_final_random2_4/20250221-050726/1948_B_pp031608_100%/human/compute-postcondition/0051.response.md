To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
- `m` is an input integer such that \(m \geq 2\).
- `_` is a placeholder (not relevant for this task).
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `i` is \(m - 2\).
- `ans` is True.
- If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` as integers followed by the integer `arr[i]`, and `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`.
- If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` starting from `m - 1` down to `1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is \(m - 2\).

2. **Adjustment for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop decrements `i` by 1 for each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be \(m - 3\).

3. **Condition for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than 0.
   - Since `i` is \(m - 3\) at the start of the next iteration, the loop will execute again if \(m - 3 > 0\), which simplifies to \(m > 3\).

### Final State:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `i` is now \(m - 3\).
- `ans` remains True unless modified within the loop body.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `m - 3`, and `ans` is True.**
