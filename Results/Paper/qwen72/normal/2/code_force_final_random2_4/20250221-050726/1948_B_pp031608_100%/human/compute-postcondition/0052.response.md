The code snippet provided converts the integer at index `i-1` in the list `arr` into a list of its digits and concatenates this list with the integer at index `i` in `arr`. Let's break down the impact:

1. `i` is defined as `m - 3`.
2. `arr[i - 1]` is accessed and converted to a string, then each character (digit) is converted back to an integer and placed into a list.
3. This list of digits is concatenated with a list containing the integer at `arr[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
- `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2.
- `_` is a placeholder.
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `i` is `m - 3`.
- `ans` is True.

After executing the code:
- `nums` is a new list that contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `m - 3`, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`.**
