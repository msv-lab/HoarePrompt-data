The code snippet converts the integer `arr[i - 1]` into a list of its digits and appends `arr[i]` to this list, storing the result in `nums`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n-1 <= 50
- `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2
- `_` is a placeholder
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `i` is 1
- `ans` is True
- The current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`

Let's assume `arr[i - 1]` is some integer `x` and `arr[i]` is some integer `y` where `y < x`.

The code `nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]` does the following:
- Converts `arr[i - 1]` (which is `x`) to a string, then splits it into individual characters, converts each character back to an integer, and creates a list of these integers.
- Appends `arr[i]` (which is `y`) to this list.

For example, if `arr[i - 1]` is 123 and `arr[i]` is 5, then `nums` will be `[1, 2, 3, 5]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n-1 <= 50
- `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2
- `_` is a placeholder
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `i` is 1
- `ans` is True
- `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n-1 <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
