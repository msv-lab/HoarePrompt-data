Reasoning:  
The provided solution aims to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by applying a specific operation any number of times. However, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Digits**: The program attempts to split the element into its digits and check if the resulting list is sorted. However, it only does this for the first occurrence where the array is not sorted. This approach is flawed because it doesn't consider the possibility of splitting multiple elements or the impact of splitting an element on subsequent elements.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting**: The program splits the element at the first out-of-order position and checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted. This is not sufficient to ensure the entire array can be made non-decreasing. For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. The program will split `12` into `[1, 2]`, but it won't correctly handle the subsequent elements to ensure the entire array is sorted.

3. **Incomplete Consideration of All Elements**: The program only checks the immediate next element after the split, which is not enough to ensure the entire array is non-decreasing. It needs to consider the impact of the split on the entire array.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
