The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently within. It does not alter the values of any variables. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged, except for the fact that the program control exits the loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `m - 2`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. The value of `arr[i - 1]` remains unchanged, and the value of `arr[i]` is less than the value of `arr[i - 1]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, no changes are made to `arr` or `ans`. `ans` is now False. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
