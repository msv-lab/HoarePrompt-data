The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the parameters `m`. The loop iterates backward from `m - 1` down to `1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `m - 2`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `m - 2`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the value of `arr[i - 1]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, no changes are made to `arr` or `ans`.**
