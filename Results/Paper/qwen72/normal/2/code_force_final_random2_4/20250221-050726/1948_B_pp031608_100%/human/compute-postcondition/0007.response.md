Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `ans` is True, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the value of `arr[i - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]` creates a new list `nums`.
- `str(arr[i - 1])` converts the integer `arr[i - 1]` to a string.
- `[int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])]` splits this string into individual characters, converts each character back to an integer, and forms a list of these integers.
- This list is then concatenated with a list containing the single element `arr[i]`.
- The resulting list `nums` contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the value of `arr[i]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged, and the condition that `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]` still holds.
