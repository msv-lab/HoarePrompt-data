Postcondition: ***`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `w` is the square root of `q`, `i` is 2, and `M` is `[1, q, 2]`.*** 

Explanation: Since the condition `i >= x - 1` is always true (as `i` is 2 and `x` is at least 1), the else part is never executed. Therefore, the postcondition is determined solely by the if part, where `M` is updated to `[1, q, 2]`.
