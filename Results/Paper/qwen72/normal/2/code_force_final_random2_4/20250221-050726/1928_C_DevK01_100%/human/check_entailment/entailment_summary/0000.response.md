### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem involves determining the number of possible values of \( k \) that fit the given constraints based on Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the sequence alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers from 1 to \( k \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calculates \( y = n + x \).
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 because no valid \( k \) can satisfy the conditions.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls the function `func_1` with parameters \((y - 2) // 2\) and \( x \) to find potential values of \( k \).
   - It then checks if \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and, if true, calls `func_1` again with parameters \((n - x) // 2\) and \( x \) to find additional potential values of \( k \).
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined, converted to a set to remove duplicates, and the length of the set is printed as the final answer.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` takes two parameters \( q \) and \( x \).
   - It initializes an empty list \( M \) to store potential values of \( k \).
   - It calculates the square root of \( q \) and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). If so, it adds it to \( M \).
   - It iterates through all integers \( i \) from 1 to the square root of \( q \), checking if \( i \) is a divisor of \( q \). If \( i \) is a divisor and both \( i \) and \( q // i \) are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \), they are added to \( M \).
   - Finally, it returns the list \( M \).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( y \) is odd by printing 0.
   - The logic for finding potential values of \( k \) using the function `func_1` is sound. It correctly identifies divisors and their corresponding quotients that meet the criteria.
   - The combination of results from both calls to `func_1` and the removal of duplicates ensures that all valid \( k \) values are considered.
   - The program's approach aligns with the problem's requirements and constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
