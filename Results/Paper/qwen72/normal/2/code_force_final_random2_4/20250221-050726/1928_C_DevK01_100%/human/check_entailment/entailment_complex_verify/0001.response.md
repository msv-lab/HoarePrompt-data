### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding all possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) fit the described pattern.
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and it alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers from 1 to \( k \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) must satisfy the condition \( n \equiv x \pmod{2k-2} \) or \( n \equiv 2k - x \pmod{2k-2} \).
   - The value \( y = n + x \) must be even for there to be any valid \( k \).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even.
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 and moves to the next test case.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls `func_1` with arguments \((y - 2) // 2\) and \( x \) to find potential values of \( k \).
   - It also checks if \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and adds more potential values of \( k \) using `func_1` with arguments \((n - x) // 2\) and \( x \).
   - The results are combined, duplicates are removed, and the length of the unique list is printed.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` takes two arguments \( q \) and \( x \).
   - It initializes an empty list \( M \) to store potential values of \( k \).
   - It calculates the square root of \( q \) and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). If so, it adds it to \( M \).
   - It iterates through all integers \( i \) from 1 to the square root of \( q \) and checks if \( q \) is divisible by \( i \). If so, it adds both \( i \) and \( q // i \) to \( M \) if they are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - Finally, it returns the list \( M \).

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the evenness check for \( y \).
   - The use of `func_1` to find potential values of \( k \) is appropriate.
   - The combination of results and removal of duplicates ensures that only unique values of \( k \) are counted.
   - The logic for checking additional conditions when \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
