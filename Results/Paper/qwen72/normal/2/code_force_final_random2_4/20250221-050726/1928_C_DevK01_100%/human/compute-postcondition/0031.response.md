Output State: **The program returns `M`, which is a list containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, including both the divisor and its corresponding quotient if the quotient is also greater than or equal to `x - 1`. Here, `q` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\), and `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < q\). The variable `w` is the square root of `q`, and `i` is equal to `w`.**
