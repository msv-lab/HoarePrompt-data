Output State: **q and x are integers such that 1 â‰¤ x < q â‰¤ 10^9, M is a list containing the integer value of w, w is the square root of q, and w is an integer (i.e., w == w // 1) and w is greater than or equal to x - 1.** 

The list `M` now contains the integer value of `w`, which is the square root of `q`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
