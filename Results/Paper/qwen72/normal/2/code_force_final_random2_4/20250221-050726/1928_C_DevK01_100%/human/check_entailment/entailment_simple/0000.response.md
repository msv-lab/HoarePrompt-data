### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Conditions:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x` from the input, where `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`.

2. **Initial Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `y = n + x`.
   - It checks if `y` is odd. If `y` is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if `y` is odd, there are no valid `k` values that satisfy the conditions of the problem.

3. **Function Call and List Initialization:**
   - If `y` is even, the program calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` and stores the result in `L1`.
   - It then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2`. If this condition is true, it adds the result of `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to `L1`.

4. **Set Conversion and Output:**
   - The program converts `L1` to a set to remove duplicates and prints the length of the set, which represents the number of valid `k` values.

5. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` initializes an empty list `M`.
   - It calculates the square root of `q` and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds the square root to `M`.
   - It iterates through all integers `i` from 1 to the square root of `q` (exclusive).
   - For each `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `q` and if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds `i` to `M`.
   - It also checks if the quotient `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds the quotient to `M`.
   - Finally, it returns the list `M`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid `k` values for each test case. The conditions and calculations are consistent with the problem description, and the function `func_1` correctly identifies the divisors of `q` that meet the criteria.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
