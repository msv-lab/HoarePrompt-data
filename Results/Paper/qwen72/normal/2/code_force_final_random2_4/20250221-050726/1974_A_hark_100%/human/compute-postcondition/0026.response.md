To determine what will be printed by the `print(math.ceil(x / 15))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `ap` must be greater than 1.
   - `k` is 1.
   - `x` and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input.
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `ap` remains greater than 1.
   - `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.
   - `bxsfory1` is 0 if the new `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of the new `x / 15`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the condition holds.
   - Otherwise, either `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, or `x` is less than or equal to 0, or `y` is not equal to 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(math.ceil(x / 15))` will print the ceiling of `x / 15`.

Given the conditions, we need to consider the value of `x`:

- If `x` is 0, then `math.ceil(0 / 15)` is `math.ceil(0)`, which is 0.
- If `x` is greater than 0, then `math.ceil(x / 15)` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x / 15`.
- If `x` is less than 0, then `math.ceil(x / 15)` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x / 15`, which will be a negative integer or zero depending on the value of `x`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the value of `x`:

Output: **math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is the value of x provided by the user input)**
