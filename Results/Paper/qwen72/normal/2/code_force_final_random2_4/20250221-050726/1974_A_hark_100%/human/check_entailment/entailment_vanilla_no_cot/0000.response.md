Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It reads the number of test cases, processes each case to calculate the minimum number of screens required based on the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, and prints the result for each test case. The logic for calculating the number of screens required for both types of icons seems to be implemented correctly, taking into account the space each type of icon occupies on the screen. The use of `math.ceil` ensures that any fractional part of the division results in an additional screen being counted, which is necessary for the problem's constraints.
