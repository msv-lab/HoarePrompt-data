Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is updated to `x - (ceiling(y / 2) * 15) + (y * 4)`, `y` is greater than 0, `ap` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of `x / 15`.**
