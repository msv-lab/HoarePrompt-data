The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function might internally handle or generate test cases involving integers `t`, `x`, and `y`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, `x` and `y` are integers (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). The function's output is not specified, but typically, such a function would process these test cases and return some result based on the values of `x` and `y` for each test case.

Since the exact output is not provided, I will assume that the function processes these test cases and returns a list of results corresponding to each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and for each test case, two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). It returns a list of results, each corresponding to the processing of `x` and `y` for the respective test case.**
