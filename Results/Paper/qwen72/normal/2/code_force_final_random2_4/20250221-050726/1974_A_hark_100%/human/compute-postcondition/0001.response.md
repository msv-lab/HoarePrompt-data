The only objects in the loop head are variables `k` and `ap`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `ap`. For the loop to execute, `ap` must be greater than 0. The variable `k` should start from 0, as is typical for Python's `range()` function.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `ap` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0**
