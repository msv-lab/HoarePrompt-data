Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `ap` remains greater than 2, `k` is 2, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if the new `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of the new `x / 15`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bxsfory` is updated to the ceiling of `y / 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `ap`, `k`, and `bxsfory1`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
