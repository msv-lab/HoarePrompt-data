To determine what will be printed by the `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
   - `y` is an integer provided by the user input.
   - `ap` remains greater than 2.
   - `k` is 2.
   - `bxsfory` is the ceiling of \( y / 2 \).
   - `bxsfory1` is 0 if the new `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of the new `x / 15`.

2. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - Calculate `bxsfory`:
     \[
     \text{bxsfory} = \left\lceil \frac{y}{2} \right\rceil
     \]
   - Update `x`:
     \[
     \text{new\_x} = x - \text{bxsfory} \times 15 + y \times 4
     \]
   - Determine `bxsfory1`:
     - If \(\text{new\_x} \leq 0\), then \(\text{bxsfory1} = 0\).
     - Otherwise, \(\text{bxsfory1} = \left\lceil \frac{\text{new\_x}}{15} \right\rceil\).

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - Compute the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`:
     \[
     \text{result} = \text{bxsfory1} + \text{bxsfory}
     \]

Given the initial state and the steps above, the output of the `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)` statement will be the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **bxsfory1 + bxsfory (where bxsfory is the ceiling of y / 2, and bxsfory1 is 0 if the new x is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is the ceiling of the new x / 15)**
