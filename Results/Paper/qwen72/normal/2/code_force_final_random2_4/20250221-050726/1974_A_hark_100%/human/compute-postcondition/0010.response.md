Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input.
- `ap` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is greater than 0.
- Additionally, either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0, which is now specifically `x` being 0.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```python
print(math.ceil(y / 2))
```

1. **Value of `y`**: According to the initial state, `y` is greater than 0. Since `y` is an integer, the smallest possible value for `y` is 1.

2. **Calculation of `y / 2`**: 
   - If `y = 1`, then `y / 2 = 0.5`.
   - If `y = 2`, then `y / 2 = 1.0`.
   - If `y = 3`, then `y / 2 = 1.5`.
   - And so on...

3. **Ceiling Function**: The `math.ceil` function rounds up to the nearest integer.
   - For `y = 1`, `math.ceil(0.5) = 1`.
   - For `y = 2`, `math.ceil(1.0) = 1`.
   - For `y = 3`, `math.ceil(1.5) = 2`.
   - For `y = 4`, `math.ceil(2.0) = 2`.
   - And so on...

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the ceiling of `y / 2`.

Output: **math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is an integer greater than 0)**

To provide a more precise answer, since `y` is greater than 0 and an integer, the output will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

For example:
- If `y = 1`, the output will be 1.
- If `y = 2`, the output will be 1.
- If `y = 3`, the output will be 2.
- If `y = 4`, the output will be 2.

Thus, the final output is:

Output: **math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is an integer greater than 0)**
