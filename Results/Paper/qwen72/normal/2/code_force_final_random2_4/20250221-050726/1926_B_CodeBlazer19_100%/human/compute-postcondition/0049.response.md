Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n`, `s` is a new input string. If the new `s` contains exactly one '1' character, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE' if the count of '1' characters in the new `s` is greater than 1, or `b` is 'SQUARE' if the count of '1' characters in the new `s` is 0.**
