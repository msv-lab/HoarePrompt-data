The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, and `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE'. If `a` is 'TRIANGLE', then `a` remains 'TRIANGLE'. If `a` is 0, then `a` remains 0.**
