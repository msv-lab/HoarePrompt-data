You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing a grid of characters ('0' or '1'). For each test case, it determines and prints whether the grid represents a "TRIANGLE" or a "SQUARE" based on the pattern of '1's. A "TRIANGLE" is identified if any row in the grid has exactly one '1', while a "SQUARE" is identified if any row has more than one '1'. If no row has exactly one '1', the function defaults to printing "SQUARE". After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic used to determine whether the shape is a triangle or a square is flawed. The program checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to identify a triangle and more than one '1' to identify a square. However, this approach fails to account for the specific structure of triangles and squares as defined in the problem statement.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
0000
0100
1110
0000
```
This input represents a triangle, but the program will incorrectly identify it as a square because the third row contains three '1's, which triggers the `b = 'SQUARE'` condition. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is thus incorrect.
