Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `s` is a new input string, `a` and `b` remain unchanged based on the initial conditions. If `s.count('1') == 1`, then `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. If `s.count('1') > 1`, then `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
