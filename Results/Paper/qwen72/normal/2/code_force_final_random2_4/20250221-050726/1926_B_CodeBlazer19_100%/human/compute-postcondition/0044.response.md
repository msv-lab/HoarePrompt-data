Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n-1`, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string if the count of '1' characters in `s` is not greater than 1, otherwise `b` is 'SQUARE'. `s` is an input string, and the count of '1' characters in `s` is not equal to 1.***
