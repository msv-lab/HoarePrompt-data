The value of `a` is explicitly set to 'TRIANGLE'. This overrides any previous conditions that might have set `a` to 0 or kept it as 'TRIANGLE'. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `s`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a new input string, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is 'SQUARE' if the count of '1' in the new `s` is greater than 1, otherwise `b` is an empty string.**
