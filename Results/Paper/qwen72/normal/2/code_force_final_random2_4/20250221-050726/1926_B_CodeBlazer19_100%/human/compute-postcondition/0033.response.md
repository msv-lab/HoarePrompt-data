The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `t` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, and `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE'. If `a` is 'TRIANGLE', then `a` remains 'TRIANGLE'. If `a` is 0, then `a` remains 0.**
