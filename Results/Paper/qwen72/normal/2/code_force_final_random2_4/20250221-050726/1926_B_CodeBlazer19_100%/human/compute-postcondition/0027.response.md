Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `a` is either 0 or 'TRIANGLE', `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE'.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will be equal to `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The variables `a` and `b` will be updated based on the input strings provided during each iteration. If any input string `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` will be set to 'TRIANGLE'. If any input string `s` contains more than one '1', `b` will be set to 'SQUARE'. If no input string meets these conditions, `a` will remain 0 and `b` will remain an empty string. The other variables (`t` and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
