Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, `i` is 1, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), and `x` is less than `y`. If `y` > `z`, `res` is 'peak'. If `y` < `z`, `res` is 'stair'. If `y` is equal to `z`, `res` is 'none'.***
