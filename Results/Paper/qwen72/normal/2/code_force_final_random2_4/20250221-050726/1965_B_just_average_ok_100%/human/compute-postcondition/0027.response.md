Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k` or `len(nums)` if no such element exists, `idx` is -1.** 

Explanation: The code snippet sets `idx` to -1. This overrides any previous value of `idx`. All other variables (`_`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
