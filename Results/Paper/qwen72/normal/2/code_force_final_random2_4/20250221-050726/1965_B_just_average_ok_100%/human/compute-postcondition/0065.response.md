Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input positive integer, `k` is the new input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `i` is 21, and `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`. If no such power of 2 exists, `idx` remains -1.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the list `nums`, which contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
- The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 21 (the length of `nums`).
- The variable `idx` is initially -1. If the loop finds an element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, it sets `idx` to the index of the previous element (i.e., the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`) and breaks out of the loop.
- If no element in `nums` is greater than `k`, `idx` remains -1.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be 21, and `idx` will either be the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k` or -1 if no such element exists.
