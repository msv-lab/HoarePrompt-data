The code removes the element `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. This means the element corresponding to the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k` is removed. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input positive integer, `k` is the new input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` appended, followed by `k + 1`, and now also includes `k + nums[idx] + 1`, but the element `1 << idx` has been removed, `i` is 21, and `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k` before the removal. If no such power of 2 exists, `idx` remains -1.**
