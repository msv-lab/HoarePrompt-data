Output State: **After all iterations, `_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are the final input values for the last test case, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) with three additional elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, but without the element `1 << idx`. The variable `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k` or `len(nums)` if no such element exists, and `idx` is `i - 1` if `i` is less than `len(nums)`, otherwise `idx` remains -1.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each iteration, the loop reads a new pair of integers `n` and `k`.
- The list `nums` is initially populated with powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
- The loop modifies `nums` by appending `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, and removing `1 << idx`.
- The variable `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, and `idx` is set to `i - 1` if such an element exists.
- After all iterations, the final state of `nums` will reflect the modifications made during the last iteration of the loop, with the same structure as described above.
