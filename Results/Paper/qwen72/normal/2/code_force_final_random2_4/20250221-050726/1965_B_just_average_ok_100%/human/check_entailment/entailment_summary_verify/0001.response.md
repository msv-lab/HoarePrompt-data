### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For every integer `v` in the range `[1, n]` except `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\).
   - It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and stores its index in `idx`.
   - It appends three additional elements to `nums`: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - It removes the element `1 << idx` from `nums`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `nums` and the elements of `nums`.

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
     - By removing `1 << idx` and adding `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`. This is because the removed element was crucial for forming `k` with other elements.
   - **Subsequences for All Other Values:**
     - The remaining elements in `nums` are powers of 2, which can form any sum up to \(2^{20} - 1\) (which is much larger than `n`).
     - The added elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` help ensure that all values from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed by appropriate subsequences.

4. **Size Constraint:**
   - The initial list `nums` has 21 elements (powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\)).
   - After removing one element and adding three new elements, the final list `nums` will have 23 elements, which is within the limit of 25.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence `a` that meets all the required conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
