The list comprehension `nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]` creates a list `nums` containing the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). Each element in the list is calculated by shifting the binary representation of 1 to the left by `i` positions, which is equivalent to multiplying 1 by \(2^i\).

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\))**.
