Let's break down the initial state and determine the length of the `nums` list step by step:

1. **Initial List Construction**:
   - `nums` starts as a list of integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). This means it contains the powers of 2 from 1 to 1048576.
   - The number of elements in this initial list is 21 (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)).

2. **Additional Elements**:
   - The list `nums` is modified by appending three additional elements:
     - `k - nums[idx]`
     - `k + 1`
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`
   - One element is removed:
     - `1 << idx` (which is equivalent to \(2^{\text{idx}}\))

3. **Index Calculation**:
   - `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k` or `len(nums)` if no such element exists.
   - `idx` is `i - 1` if `i` is less than `len(nums)`, otherwise `idx` remains -1.

4. **Final Length Calculation**:
   - Initially, `nums` has 21 elements.
   - Three elements are added: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - One element is removed: `1 << idx`.

   Therefore, the net change in the length of `nums` is:
   \[
   \text{Initial length} + 3 - 1 = 21 + 3 - 1 = 23
   \]

So, the final length of `nums` is 23.

Output: **23**
