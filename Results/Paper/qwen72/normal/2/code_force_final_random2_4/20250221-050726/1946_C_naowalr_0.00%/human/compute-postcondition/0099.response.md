The code `adj[a].append(b)` adds `b` to the list `adj[a]`. This means that `b` is now included in `adj[a]` as an additional element. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements (with `b` added as an additional element), `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements.**
