Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where each `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain the respective appended values from the loop, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, and `R - L > 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `x = (L + R) // 2` updates the value of `x` to the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `z`, `n`, `adj`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `leftover`, `numCuts`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `R - L > 1` remains valid.
- The updated value of `x` is now `(L + R) // 2`.
