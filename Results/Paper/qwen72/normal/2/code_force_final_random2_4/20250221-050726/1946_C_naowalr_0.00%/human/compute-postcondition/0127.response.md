Output State: **`n` remains `new_n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a list of lists as described, `t` and `z` remain unchanged, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. `R - L` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `numCuts` to 0, which updates its value from the initial state. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `adj`, `t`, `z`, `x`, and `leftover`) retain their initial values or expressions. The condition `R - L > 1` remains unchanged.
