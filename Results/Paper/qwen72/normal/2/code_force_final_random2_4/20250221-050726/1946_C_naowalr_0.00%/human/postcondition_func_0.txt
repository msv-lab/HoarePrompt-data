The function `func_1` reads a series of inputs from standard input. It first reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `n-1` pairs of integers `a` and `b`. These pairs represent edges in a tree structure. The function then performs a binary search to find the maximum value `L` that satisfies certain conditions involving the number of cuts (`numCuts`) and a leftover value from a depth-first search (DFS). The function prints the value of `L` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state includes the processed values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and the adjacency list `adj`, with `t` being 0 and `L` being the largest integer that meets the specified conditions.
