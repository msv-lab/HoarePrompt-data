Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where each element `a` and `b` read from the input during the loop has been appended to `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` respectively, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L <= 1`. The final values of `L` and `R` will be such that `R - L <= 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `R - L > 1`.
- Each iteration of the loop updates `x` to be the midpoint of `L` and `R`.
- Depending on the conditions involving `numCuts` and `leftover`, either `L` is updated to `x` or `R` is updated to `x`.
- This process narrows down the range between `L` and `R` until `R - L <= 1`.
- At this point, the loop terminates, and the final values of `L` and `R` will be such that `R - L <= 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `leftover`, `numCuts`) remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.
