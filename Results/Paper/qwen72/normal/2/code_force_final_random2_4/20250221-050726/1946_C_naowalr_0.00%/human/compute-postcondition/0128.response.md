Output State: **`n` remains `new_n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a list of lists as described, `t` and `z` remain unchanged, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.**

Explanation:
- The code `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` assigns the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call to the variable `leftover`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `adj`, `t`, `z`, `numCuts`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition `R - L > 1` is still valid and does not affect the state of the variables.
