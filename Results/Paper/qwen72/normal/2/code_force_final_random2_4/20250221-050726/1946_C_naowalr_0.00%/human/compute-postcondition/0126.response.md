Output State: **`n` remains `new_n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a list of lists as described, `t` and `z` remain unchanged, `numCuts` is now 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. `R - L` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `x = (L + R) // 2` updates the value of `x` to the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
