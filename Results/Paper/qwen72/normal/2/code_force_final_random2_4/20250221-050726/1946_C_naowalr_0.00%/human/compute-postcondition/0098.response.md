The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, and `adj[a]` includes `b` as one of its elements, and `adj[b]` includes `a` as one of its elements. After executing the code, `a` and `b` are updated with the new values read from the input.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements, `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements.**
