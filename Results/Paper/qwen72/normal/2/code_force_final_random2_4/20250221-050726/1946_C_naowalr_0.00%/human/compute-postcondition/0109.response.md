The only variables in the loop head are `L` and `R`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `R - L > 1`. Right before the loop, `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001. Given these values, `R - L` is 100000, which is greater than 1, so the loop condition is already satisfied.

Since the condition `R - L > 1` is already true with the given values of `L` and `R`, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` remains `new_n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a list of lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` in the input, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` in the input. The variables `t`, `z`, `leftover`, `x`, and the condition `R - L <= 1` remain unchanged. `L` is now 1. `R` is now 100001. `numCuts` is 0.**
