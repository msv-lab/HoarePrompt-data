Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where each `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain the respective appended values from the loop, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L > 1`, `L` is now equal to `(L + R) // 2`.**
