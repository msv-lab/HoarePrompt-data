Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values in ascending order, `suma` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while numbers != []:
    a = int(numbers.pop(0))
    b = int(numbers.pop(0))
    suma += min(a, b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values in ascending order (with the first two elements removed), `suma` is now equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the second element that was removed from `numbers`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values in ascending order (with the first four elements removed) and `numbers` must not be empty, `suma` is now equal to `2 * min(a, b)`, `a` is the integer value of the second element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the fourth element that was removed from `numbers`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values in ascending order (with the first five elements removed), `a` is the integer value of the third element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the fifth element that was removed from `numbers`, `suma` is now equal to `3 * min(a, b)`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
