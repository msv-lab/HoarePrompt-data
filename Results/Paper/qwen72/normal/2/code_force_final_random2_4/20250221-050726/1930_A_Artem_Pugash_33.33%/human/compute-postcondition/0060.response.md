The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters within the function signature, but based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function should accept the following:

- An integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, representing the numbers written on the whiteboard.

The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, but typically, such a function would process each test case and return a result for each one. Since the exact output is not provided, I will assume that the function processes the input and returns a result for each test case, which could be a list of results corresponding to each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one, likely a list of results corresponding to each test case.**
