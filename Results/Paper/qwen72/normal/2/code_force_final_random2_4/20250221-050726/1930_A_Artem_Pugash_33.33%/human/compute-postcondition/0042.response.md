Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list of strings representing the input values split by spaces, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers` until the list is empty.** 

Explanation: The code `numbers = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces. The variable `numbers` now contains this list of strings. All other variables remain unchanged.
