Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values in ascending order (with the first five elements removed) and `numbers` must not be empty, `suma` is now equal to `2 * min(a, b)`, `a` is the integer value of the third element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the fourth element that was removed from `numbers`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = int(numbers.pop(0))` removes the first element from the `numbers` list and assigns its integer value to `a`.
- The `numbers` list now has the first five elements removed instead of the first four.
- The value of `a` is updated to the integer value of the third element that was originally removed from `numbers`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
