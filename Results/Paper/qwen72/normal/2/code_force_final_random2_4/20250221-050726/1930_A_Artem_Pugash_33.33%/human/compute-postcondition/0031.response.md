Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values in ascending order (with the first three elements removed) and `numbers` must not be empty, `suma` is now equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`, `a` is the integer value of the second element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the third element that was removed from `numbers`.**
