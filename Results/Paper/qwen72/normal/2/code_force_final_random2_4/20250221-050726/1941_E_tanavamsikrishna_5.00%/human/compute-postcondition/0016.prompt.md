You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of non-negative integers where the first and last elements are 0, representing the depths of the river cells in a row, and d is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= len(row).
def func_1(row, d):
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
        
    #State: `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d-1` elements are each incremented by 1, and the last element remains 0; `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= len(row); `i` is `d-2`.
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `row` will have its first `d-1` elements each incremented by 1, and the elements from index `d-1` to the end of the list will each be set to the value of their respective index plus 1. The value of `d` and `i` remain unchanged.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the value of the last element in the list `row`, which is equal to the index of the last element plus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers (with the first and last elements being 0) and a positive integer `d` within the range of the length of `row`. It returns the value of the last element in the list `row`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of the last element in the list `row`, which is equal to the index of the last element plus 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
