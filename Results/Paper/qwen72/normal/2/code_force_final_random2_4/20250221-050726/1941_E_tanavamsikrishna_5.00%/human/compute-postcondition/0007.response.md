Output State: **`total_costs` is a list containing the sums of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1` of `costs`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged, `rows` remains unchanged, `costs` remains unchanged, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1` of the `costs` list to the `total_costs` list. Since `i` is 1, the new element added to `total_costs` is the sum of the elements from index 1 to `1 + k - 1` (or simply `1 + k - 1`) of the `costs` list. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs`) remain unchanged.
