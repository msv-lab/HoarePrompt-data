Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the requirement that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. Specifically, in `func_1`, the logic for placing supports and calculating the cost does not ensure that the distance condition is met. For example, if `d` is 2, the function might place supports too far apart, violating the condition that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

A specific case where the program fails:
- Consider a row with depths `[0, 1, 2, 3, 0]` and `d = 2`.
- According to the problem description, supports must be placed at the first and last columns, and the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than 2.
- The correct placement would be at indices 0, 2, and 4, resulting in a cost of `(0+1) + (2+1) + (0+1) = 5`.
- However, the current implementation in `func_1` does not ensure this and might incorrectly calculate the cost or place supports incorrectly.

This indicates that the program does not meet the problem's requirements for every potential case.
