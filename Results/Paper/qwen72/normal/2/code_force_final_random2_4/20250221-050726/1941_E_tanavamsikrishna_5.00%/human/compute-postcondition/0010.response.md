Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `total_costs` is a list containing the sums of every contiguous subsequence of `k` elements in `costs`. The length of `total_costs` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged, as do `rows` and `costs`. The loop variable `i` has reached the value `len(costs) - k`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, `total_costs` will contain the sum of every possible contiguous subsequence of `k` elements from the `costs` list. The number of elements in `total_costs` will be equal to the number of such subsequences, which is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs`) remain unchanged, and the loop variable `i` will have the final value of `len(costs) - k`.
