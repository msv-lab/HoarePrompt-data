Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Function 1: `func_1(row, d)`
1. **Initial State**: `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first and last elements are 0, representing the depths of the river cells in a row, and `d` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le d \le \text{len(row)}\).

2. **First Loop**:
   ```python
   for i in range(0, d - 1):
       row[i] = row[i] + 1
   ```
   - This loop increments the first `d-1` elements of `row` by 1. This ensures that the first `d-1` cells have supports, which is necessary because the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

3. **Second Loop**:
   ```python
   for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
       row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
   ```
   - This loop calculates the cost for each cell starting from index `d-1` to the end of the row.
   - The expression `min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i])` finds the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells (excluding the current cell). This ensures that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - The cost for each cell is then calculated as the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus the depth of the current cell plus 1.

4. **Return Statement**:
   ```python
   return row[-1]
   ```
   - The function returns the cost of the last cell in the row, which represents the total cost of building the bridge in that row.

### Function 2: `func_2()`
1. **Initial State**: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers such that \(1 \le k \le n \le 100\), \(3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5\), and \(1 \le d \le m\). `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the constraints \(0 \le a_{i, j} \le 10^6\), \(a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0\).

2. **Reading Input**:
   ```python
   n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
   rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
   ```
   - This reads the input values and constructs the `rows` list.

3. **Calculating Costs**:
   ```python
   costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
   ```
   - This calculates the cost of building a bridge for each row using `func_1`.

4. **Finding Minimum Total Cost**:
   ```python
   total_costs = []
   for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
       total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
   print(min(total_costs))
   ```
   - This calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges and finds the minimum total cost.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment
The original assessment states that the program does not handle the requirement that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. However, upon closer inspection of `func_1`, we see that:

- The first loop ensures that the first `d-1` cells have supports.
- The second loop ensures that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d` by using the `min` function to find the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells.

Therefore, the program does indeed handle the requirement correctly.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The program correctly handles the requirement that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

Final: **True**
