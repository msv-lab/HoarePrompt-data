The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `costs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the length of `costs` minus `(k - 1)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 2.

State: **`total_costs` is a list containing the sums of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1` of `costs`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged, `rows` remains unchanged, `costs` remains unchanged, `i` is 2**.
