The code snippet reads `n` lines of input, where each line is split into a list of integers, and these lists are stored in the variable `rows`. The structure of `rows` will be a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged, but `rows` is updated with the new values from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the constraints 0 ≤ a_{i, j} ≤ 10^6, a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0. The values in `rows` are now updated with the specific values provided by the user input.**
