The function `func_2` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows`. Here, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. The parameter `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the constraints 0 ≤ a_{i, j} ≤ 10^6, and a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0.

The function returns a specific value based on the input parameters, but the exact return value is not specified in the provided information. However, given the context, it is likely that the function processes the river cell depths and returns some form of result related to the river's properties or conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows`, where `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers within specified ranges, and `rows` is a list of `n` lists containing `m` integers representing river cell depths. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, likely related to the river's properties or conditions.**
