Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a list `row` of non-negative integers (where the first and last elements are 0) and a positive integer `d` such that 1 <= d <= len(row). It modifies the list `row` by incrementing the first `d-1` elements by 1 and setting each subsequent element (from index `d-1` to the end) to the minimum value of the previous `d+1` elements (or 0 if there are fewer than `d+1` elements) plus the current value plus 1. The function returns the value of the last element in the modified list `row`, which is equal to the index of the last element plus 1. **
