To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(total_costs))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

### Initial State:
- `total_costs` is a list containing the sums of every contiguous subsequence of `k` elements in `costs`.
- The length of `total_costs` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
- The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged.
- The lists `rows` and `costs` remain unchanged.
- The loop variable `i` has reached the value `len(costs) - k`.

### Explanation:
1. **`total_costs` List Construction**:
   - `total_costs` is constructed by iterating over the `costs` list and summing every contiguous subsequence of `k` elements.
   - For example, if `costs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 3`, then `total_costs` would be `[6, 9, 12]` because:
     - The first subsequence is `[1, 2, 3]` with a sum of `6`.
     - The second subsequence is `[2, 3, 4]` with a sum of `9`.
     - The third subsequence is `[3, 4, 5]` with a sum of `12`.

2. **Finding the Minimum Value**:
   - The `min(total_costs)` function will find the smallest value in the `total_costs` list.
   - In the example above, the minimum value in `[6, 9, 12]` is `6`.

### Final Output:
The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum value from the `total_costs` list, which is the smallest sum of any contiguous subsequence of `k` elements in the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where min(total_costs) is the smallest sum of any contiguous subsequence of k elements in the costs list)**
