Output State: **`total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged, `rows` remains unchanged, `costs` remains unchanged, `i` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))` appends the sum of the first `k` elements of the `costs` list to the `total_costs` list.
- Since `i` is 0, the slice `costs[i:i + k]` corresponds to the first `k` elements of `costs`.
- The `total_costs` list, which was initially empty, now contains one element: the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged.
- The `rows` list remains unchanged.
- The `costs` list remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains 0.
