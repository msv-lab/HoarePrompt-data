Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
- The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the minimum cost of building a bridge in a single row. However, it incorrectly modifies the row values in a way that does not correctly account for the constraints of the problem, particularly the requirement that the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
- The function `func_2` reads input and processes it, but it relies on `func_1` which is flawed.
- Specifically, the loop in `func_1` that updates the row values does not correctly handle the dynamic programming aspect of the problem. It should be calculating the minimum cost to place supports while ensuring the distance constraint is met, but the current implementation does not do this correctly.

A correct approach would involve a more sophisticated dynamic programming solution to ensure that the distance constraint is respected and the minimum cost is calculated accurately.
