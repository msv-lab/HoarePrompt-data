Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not calculate the product of the remaining elements of the array `a` before each removal and then take the modulus with `m`. Instead, it incorrectly appends the removed elements to a list `b` and calculates the cumulative product of these removed elements in reverse order, which is not what the problem requires.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    # Calculate the initial product of all elements
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    
    # Initialize the answer list
    ans = []
    
    # Initialize pointers for the left and right ends of the array
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    
    for i in range(n):
        ans.append(product)
        
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[l], m-2, m)) % m
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[r], m-2, m)) % m
            r -= 1
    
    return ans
```

This corrected function:
1. Calculates the initial product of all elements in the array `a` modulo `m`.
2. For each command, it appends the current product to the answer list.
3. If the command is 'L', it updates the product by dividing it by the leftmost element (using modular inverse).
4. If the command is 'R', it updates the product by dividing it by the rightmost element (using modular inverse).

This ensures that the product is correctly updated and the remainder is taken at each step, as required by the problem statement.
