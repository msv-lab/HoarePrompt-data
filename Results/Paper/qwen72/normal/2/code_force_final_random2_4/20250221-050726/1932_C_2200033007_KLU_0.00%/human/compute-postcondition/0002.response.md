Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is an empty list, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.** 

The variable `r` is now set to `n - 1`, which means `r` is the index of the last element in the list `a` or the last character in the string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
