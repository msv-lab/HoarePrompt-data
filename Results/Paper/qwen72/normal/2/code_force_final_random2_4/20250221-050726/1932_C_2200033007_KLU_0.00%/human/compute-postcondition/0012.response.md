The code snippet `b.append(a[l])` appends the element at index `l` from list `a` to list `b`. However, the initial state does not specify the values of `a`, `b`, or `l`. Therefore, we can only infer that the operation modifies `b` by adding an element from `a`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` now contains one additional element from `a` at index `l`.**
