Output State: **`b` is a list with at least 1 element, `v` is the last element of `b`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is an empty list, `p` is `v`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`**

Explanation: The value of `p` is updated to be the product of its current value (which was 1) and `v` (the last element of `b`). All other variables remain unchanged.
