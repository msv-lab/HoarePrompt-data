The value of `p` is updated to `p * v`. Since `v` is the last element of `b` and `p` was initially the product of the last element and the second-to-last element of `b`, the new value of `p` is now the product of the last element of `b` (which is `v`) and itself (which is `p`). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is a list with at least 3 elements, `v` is the last element of `b`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing `[p * v, p]`, `p` is the product of the last element of `b` and itself, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`**
