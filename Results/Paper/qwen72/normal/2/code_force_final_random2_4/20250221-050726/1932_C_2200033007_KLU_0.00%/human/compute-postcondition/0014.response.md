The code snippet `b.append(a[r])` appends the element at index `r` of list `a` to the list `b`. However, the initial state does not specify the values of `a`, `b`, or `r`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value being appended to `b`. The only information we have is that `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` is 1. Since the code does not modify `n` or `i`, these values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` has one additional element which is `a[r]` (the value of `r` is not specified).**
