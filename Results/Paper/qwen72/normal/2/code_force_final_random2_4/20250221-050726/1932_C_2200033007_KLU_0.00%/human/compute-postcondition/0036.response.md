Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order.** 

This means that the returned list will start with the product of all elements in `b`, followed by the product of all elements except the last one, and so on, until the last element of the returned list, which will be the first element of `b`. The length of the returned list will be the same as the length of `b`, which is `n`.
