Output State: **`b` is a list with at least 1 element, `v` is the last element of `b`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing `[p]`, `p` is `v`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(p)` adds the value of `p` to the list `ans`.
- Initially, `ans` was an empty list, so after appending `p`, `ans` now contains `[p]`.
- The value of `p` is `v`, which is the last element of `b`.
- All other variables (`b`, `v`, `n`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
