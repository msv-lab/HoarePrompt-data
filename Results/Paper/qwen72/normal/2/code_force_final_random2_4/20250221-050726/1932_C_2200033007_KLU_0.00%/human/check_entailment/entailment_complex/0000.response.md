Reasoning:  

The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality as specified in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation**: The function `func_1` appends elements to the list `b` based on the commands 'L' or 'R', but it does not calculate the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` before appending the result to the output. Instead, it simply appends the elements themselves to `b`.

2. **Product Modulo m**: The problem requires calculating the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` and taking the modulo `m` before each command is processed. The provided code does not perform this calculation.

3. **Reversed Cumulative Product**: The final step of computing the cumulative product in reverse order is unnecessary and incorrect. The problem requires the product of the remaining elements at each step, not a cumulative product.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        product = (product * a[l]) % m if s[i] == 'L' else (product * a[r]) % m
        b.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            l += 1
        else:
            r -= 1
    return b
```

This corrected function:
- Maintains a running product of the elements in `a` and updates it with the modulo `m` at each step.
- Appends the current product to the list `b` before removing the element from `a` based on the command 'L' or 'R'.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
