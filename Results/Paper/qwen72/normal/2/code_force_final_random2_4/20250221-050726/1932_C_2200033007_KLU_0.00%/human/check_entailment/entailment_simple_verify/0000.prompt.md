You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

The list `b` will have exactly `n` elements, and the indices `l` and `r` will be out of bounds (specifically, `l` will be `n` and `r` will be `-1`).

    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the issue lies in how the product of the remaining elements is calculated and updated after each command.

### Problem with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Product Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the product of the elements that are removed (`a[l]` or `a[r]`) and appends this product to the result list `ans`. However, the problem requires the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` after each command, not the product of the elements that are removed.
   - For example, if the array is `[3, 1, 4, 2]` and the command is `L`, the program should calculate the product of the remaining elements `[1, 4, 2]` and then take the modulo `m`.

2. **Incorrect Order of Operations**:
   - The program appends the product of the removed elements to the result list `ans` and then reverses the list at the end. This is incorrect because the problem requires the product of the remaining elements at each step, not the product of the removed elements.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```
- **Initial State**: Array `a = [3, 1, 4, 2]`
- **Command 1 (L)**:
  - Remove the leftmost element `3`.
  - Remaining array: `[1, 4, 2]`
  - Product: `1 * 4 * 2 = 8`
  - Modulo 6: `8 % 6 = 2`
  - Expected output: `2`
  - Actual output: `3` (incorrect)

- **Command 2 (R)**:
  - Remove the rightmost element `2`.
  - Remaining array: `[1, 4]`
  - Product: `1 * 4 = 4`
  - Modulo 6: `4 % 6 = 4`
  - Expected output: `4`
  - Actual output: `2` (incorrect)

- **Command 3 (R)**:
  - Remove the rightmost element `4`.
  - Remaining array: `[1]`
  - Product: `1`
  - Modulo 6: `1 % 6 = 1`
  - Expected output: `1`
  - Actual output: `4` (incorrect)

- **Command 4 (L)**:
  - Remove the leftmost element `1`.
  - Remaining array: `[]`
  - Product: `1` (since the array is empty, the product is 1)
  - Modulo 6: `1 % 6 = 1`
  - Expected output: `1`
  - Actual output: `1` (correct, but only by coincidence)

### Correct Approach:
To fix the program, you should maintain the product of the remaining elements and update it after each command. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    
    results = []
    for i in range(n):
        results.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[0], m-2, m)) % m
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[-1], m-2, m)) % m
            a.pop(-1)
    
    return results
```

This approach uses modular arithmetic to efficiently update the product after each command, ensuring that the product of the remaining elements is correctly calculated and updated.
