Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6, `x` is 1, `y` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`, `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.
- For each iteration, if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
- After the loop finishes, `y` will be the smallest integer greater than 1 such that either `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m` is true.
- The value of `cnt` will be the sum of the increments for all valid pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and the conditions are met.
