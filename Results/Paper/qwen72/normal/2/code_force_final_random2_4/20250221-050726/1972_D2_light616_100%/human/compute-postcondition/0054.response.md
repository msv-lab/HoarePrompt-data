Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), `x` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(x \cdot x > n\), `y` is 1, and `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\).**

### Explanation:
- **`x`**: After the loop completes, `x` will be the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(x \cdot x > n\). This is because the loop continues as long as \(x \cdot x \leq n\), and it increments `x` by 1 each time through the outer loop.
- **`y`**: The variable `y` is reset to 1 at the start of each iteration of the outer loop, so when the loop finishes, `y` will be 1.
- **`cnt`**: The variable `cnt` accumulates the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\). This means that `cnt` will contain the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy the conditions within the loop.
- **`n` and `m`**: These values remain unchanged throughout the loop, as they are only used for comparison and do not get modified within the loop.
