### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the original assessment step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - This aligns with the problem description, so the input handling is correct.

2. **Pair Generation**:
   - The program uses nested loops to generate pairs `(x, y)`.
   - The outer loop runs while `x * x <= n`.
   - The inner loop runs while `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
   - These conditions ensure that the generated pairs `(x, y)` are within the specified bounds.

3. **GCD Check**:
   - The program checks if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`.
   - This check is necessary because the problem requires that `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`, and this condition simplifies to checking if `gcd(a, b) == 1` when `a` and `b` are coprime.

4. **Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - The program counts the number of valid pairs using the expression `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
   - This expression correctly calculates the number of valid pairs for each `(x, y)` pair where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the count of valid pairs for each test case.
   - This matches the expected output format.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **State Before `func_1` Call**:
  - No variables are passed as arguments to `func_1`.
  - The function reads `n` and `m` from standard input, ensuring they are within the specified bounds.

- **State Before `func_2` Call**:
  - `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`.
  - `func_1` is called `t` times, processing each test case individually.

- **State After `func_1` Execution**:
  - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`.
  - `x` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `x * x > n`.
  - `y` is 1.
  - `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
