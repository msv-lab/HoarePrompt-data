To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The variables involved in the loop condition are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
   - `x` is 1.
   - `y` is 3.
   - `cnt` is updated to `min(n // 2, m // 2) + min(n // 3, m // 6)` if the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 0.

3. **Check the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
   - Substituting the current values:
     - \( (1 + 3) * 1 = 4 \)
     - \( (1 + 3) * 3 = 12 \)
   - Therefore, the conditions become:
     - \( 4 \leq n \)
     - \( 12 \leq m \)

4. **Determine Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be satisfied.
   - Since `x` and `y` are fixed at 1 and 3 respectively, the only variables that can be adjusted are `n` and `m`.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - `n` must be at least 4.
   - `m` must be at least 12.

### Final State:
Since the current state already satisfies these conditions (as `n` and `m` are positive integers within the given range), no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, `cnt` is updated to `min(n // 2, m // 2) + min(n // 3, m // 6)` if the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 0**.
