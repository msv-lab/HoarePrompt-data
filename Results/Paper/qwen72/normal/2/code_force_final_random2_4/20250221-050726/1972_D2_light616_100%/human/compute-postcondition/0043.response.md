The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `y` is 1, so after the increment, `y` becomes 2. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), `x` is 5, `y` is 2, and `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\). If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 30, m // 6)`.**
