Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

# Annotated Functions:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed as arguments to the function `func_1`. The function reads `n` and `m` from standard input, where `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), `x` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(x \cdot x > n\), `y` is 1, and `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\).
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the sum of min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)) for all pairs (x, y) where gcd(x, y) == 1 and (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from standard input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. It calculates the number of pairs (x, y) such that 1 ≤ x, y, (x + y) * x ≤ n, (x + y) * y ≤ m, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and y is 1. The function then prints this count. After the function concludes, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the count of valid pairs is printed to the standard output.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `func_1()` has been called `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a positive integer `t` from the user input, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. The function then calls another function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function completes, `t` remains unchanged, and `func_1` has been executed `t` times. The function itself does not return any value.
