The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from standard input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. It calculates the number of pairs (x, y) such that 1 ≤ x, y, (x + y) * x ≤ n, (x + y) * y ≤ m, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and y is 1. The function then prints this count. After the function concludes, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the count of valid pairs is printed to the standard output.
