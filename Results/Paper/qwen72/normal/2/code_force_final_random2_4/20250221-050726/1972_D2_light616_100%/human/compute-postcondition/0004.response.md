The function `func_1()` is called again, but since the initial state already mentions that `func_1()` has been called, and there is no additional information about what `func_1()` does or changes, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The only update is that `func_1()` has been called one more time.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `func_1()` has been called twice.**
