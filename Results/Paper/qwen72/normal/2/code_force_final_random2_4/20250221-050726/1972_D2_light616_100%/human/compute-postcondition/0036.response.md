The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `x` was 3, so the new value of `x` is 4. The values of `n`, `m`, `y`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), `x` is 4, `y` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 4 such that \((x + y) * x > n\) or \((x + y) * y > m\), and `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\).**
