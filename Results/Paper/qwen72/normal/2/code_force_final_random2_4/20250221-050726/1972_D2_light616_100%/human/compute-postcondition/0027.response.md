To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

Given the current state:
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 2
- `n` must be at least 9
- `m` must be at least 4
- `cnt` remains unchanged

Let's evaluate the conditions with these values:
1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
   - Substituting `x = 3` and `y = 2`:
   - `(3 + 2) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - Therefore, the condition becomes `15 <= n`
   - Since `n` must be at least 9, it needs to be at least 15 for the loop to execute again.

2. `(x + y) * y <= m`
   - Substituting `x = 3` and `y = 2`:
   - `(3 + 2) * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - Therefore, the condition becomes `10 <= m`
   - Since `m` must be at least 4, it needs to be at least 10 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be at least 15 and `m` must be at least 10.

State: **`n` must be at least 15, `m` must be at least 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 2, `cnt` remains unchanged**
