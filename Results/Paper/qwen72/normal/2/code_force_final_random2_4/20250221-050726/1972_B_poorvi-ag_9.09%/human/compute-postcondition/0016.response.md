The code snippet `arr = input()` updates the value of `arr` to a new input string. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `n` is a new input integer, `arr` is a new input string, `results` is a list containing ['no'] if `n` is even, or ['yes'] if `n` is odd and the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is greater than the number of 'D' characters, otherwise ['no'].**
