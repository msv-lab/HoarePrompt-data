Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is the subsequent element in `results`.
- `n` is the last input integer.
- `arr` is the last input string.
- `results` is a list of length `t` and contains at least one more element.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is described as "the subsequent element in `results`."
- Since `results` is a list of length `t` and contains at least one more element, `i` refers to the next element in the list after the current position.
- The exact value of `i` depends on the content of the `results` list, but it is the next element in the list.

### Output:
The code will print the value of `i`, which is the next element in the `results` list after the current position.

Output: **i (where i is the next element in the results list)**
