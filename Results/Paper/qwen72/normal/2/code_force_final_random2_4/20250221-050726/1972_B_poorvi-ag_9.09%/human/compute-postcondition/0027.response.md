The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. This impacts the `results` list by adding a new element to it. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `arr` is a new input string.
- `results` is a list that initially contains:
  - ['no', 'no'] if `n` is even.
  - ['yes', 'no'] if `n` is odd and the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is greater than the number of 'D' characters.
  - ['no', 'no'] if `n` is odd and the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is not greater than the number of 'D' characters.

After appending `'no'` to `results`, the updated state is:

- If `n` is even, `results` will be ['no', 'no', 'no'].
- If `n` is odd and the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is greater than the number of 'D' characters, `results` will be ['yes', 'no', 'no'].
- If `n` is odd and the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is not greater than the number of 'D' characters, `results` will be ['no', 'no', 'no'].

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `n` is a new input integer, `arr` is a new input string, `results` is a list containing: ['no', 'no', 'no'] if `n` is even, ['yes', 'no', 'no'] if `n` is odd and the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is greater than the number of 'D' characters, or ['no', 'no', 'no'] if `n` is odd and the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is not greater than the number of 'D' characters.**
