Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is `t - 1`.
- `n` is the last input integer.
- `arr` is the last input string.
- `results` is a list of length `t` and contains at least one element.

The code snippet to analyze is:
```python
print(i)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `t`:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100. Let's denote this value as `t`.

2. **Calculate the value of `i`:**
   - According to the initial state, `i` is `t - 1`.
   - Therefore, if `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, then `i` will be an integer between 0 and 99.

3. **Print the value of `i`:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is `t - 1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **t - 1 (where t is an integer between 1 and 100)**
