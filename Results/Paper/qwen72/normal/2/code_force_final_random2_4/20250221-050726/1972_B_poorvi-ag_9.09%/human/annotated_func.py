#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins. The function should also handle an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, `arr` is the last input string, and `results` is a list of length `t`. For each element in `results`, if the corresponding `n` is even, the element is 'no'. If the corresponding `n` is odd and the number of 'U' characters in the corresponding `arr` is greater than the number of 'D' characters, the element is 'yes'. Otherwise, the element is 'no'.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is the last element in `results`, `n` is the last input integer, `arr` is the last input string, `results` is a list of length `t` and all elements have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, the function determines whether the number of 'U' characters in `s` is greater than the number of 'D' characters when `n` is odd, and always returns 'no' if `n` is even. The results for all test cases are collected in a list and printed one by one. After the function concludes, the input variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` retain their last values, and the list `results` contains the processed outcomes for each test case, which have all been printed.
