The value of `s` is updated by subtracting `p[a - 2]` from its current value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers based on user input, `l` is a list of integers based on user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers based on user input, `s` is now equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
