Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in how it calculates the sum of the subarray. Specifically, the line `if a - 2 >= 0:` and the subsequent subtraction `s -= p[a - 2]` is incorrect. The prefix sum `p` is used to calculate the sum of the subarray from `a` to `b`, but the subtraction should be `s -= p[a - 1]` instead of `s -= p[a - 2]`.

Here's a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```

However, if we change the input slightly to:

**Input:**
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
YES
```

In the last query (2, 4), the subarray is [2, 1, 4]. The sum of this subarray is 7. To form a good array `b`, we need to ensure that the sum of `b` is also 7, and each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in the subarray and greater than 0. However, the program incorrectly prints "YES" because it incorrectly calculates the sum of the subarray.

The correct way to calculate the sum of the subarray from `a` to `b` using prefix sums is:
- If `a` is 1, the sum is `p[b - 1]`.
- Otherwise, the sum is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

But the program uses `p[a - 2]` which is incorrect. It should be `p[a - 1]`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
