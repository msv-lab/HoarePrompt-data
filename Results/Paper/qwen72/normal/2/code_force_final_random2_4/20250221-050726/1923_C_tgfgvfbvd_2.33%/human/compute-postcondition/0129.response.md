Output State: **_ is 0, t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers based on user input, l is a list of integers based on user input, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in l, c is equal to the sum of all elements in l. For each of the m queries, a and b are integers based on user input. If a - 2 is greater than or equal to 0, s is equal to p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]. Otherwise, s remains equal to p[b - 1]. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `_` (which is used as a placeholder in the loop) is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` retain their initial values based on the user input. The list `l` contains the integers provided by the user, and `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the elements in `l`. The variable `c` holds the total sum of the elements in `l`. For each query, the variables `a` and `b` are set based on user input, and the value of `s` is calculated accordingly. The loop then checks the conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the results of these conditions.
