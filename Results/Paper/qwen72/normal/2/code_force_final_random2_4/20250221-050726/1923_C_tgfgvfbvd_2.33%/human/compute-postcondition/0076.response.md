Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, and `s` is initially `p[b - 1]`. If `a` is at least 2, `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - 2 * p[a - 2]`. If `a` is less than 2, `s` remains `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Regardless of whether the condition `(b - a + 1) > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` holds, the final value of `s` is determined as described above.***
