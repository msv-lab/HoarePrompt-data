Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers based on user input, `l` is a list of integers based on user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers based on user input. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0 (i.e., `a` is at least 2), then `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains equal to `p[b - 1]`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 2 times `(b - a + 1)`, then the condition for the if part is met. Otherwise, either `(b - a + 1)` is less than or equal to 1, or `s` is less than 2 times `(b - a + 1)`.**
