Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` and `m` are integers based on user input, `l` is a list of integers based on user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are integers based on user input, `s` is now equal to `p[b - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `s = p[b - 1]` assigns the value of `p[b - 1]` to `s`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` and the logic for the if part or else part are not affected by this assignment, so they remain as described in the initial state.
