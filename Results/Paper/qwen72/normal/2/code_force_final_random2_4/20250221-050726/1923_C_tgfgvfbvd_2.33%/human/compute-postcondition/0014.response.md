Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers based on user input, `l` is a list of integers based on user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in `l`.**

Explanation:
- `t`, `_`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `l` remains the same as it is the input list and is not altered within the loop.
- `p` becomes a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point.
- `c` ends up being the total sum of all elements in `l` after the loop completes.
