Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers based on user input, `l` is a list of integers based on user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers based on user input. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is now equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains equal to `p[b - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the program follows the logic for the if part. Otherwise, the program follows the logic for the else part.***
