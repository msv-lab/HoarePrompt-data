Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 2, `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, `a3` and `l3` are the next tuple in `val`, `val` is no longer an empty list but contains `m-2` elements. If `l3` is not equal to `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as normal.***
