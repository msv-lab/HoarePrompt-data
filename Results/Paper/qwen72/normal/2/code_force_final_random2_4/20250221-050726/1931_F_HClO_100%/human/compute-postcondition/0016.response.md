The `input()` function call waits for user input and consumes one line of input. Since no variable is assigned the result of `input()`, the input itself does not affect the state of the program. All the variables retain their previous values and conditions.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `m` must be greater than 2, `l11` and `l22` are not equal.**
