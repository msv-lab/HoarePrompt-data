Postcondition: **The loop has completed all its iterations, so `i` is `n-2`. The values of `idx1` and `idx2` depend on whether the conditions inside the loop were met. Specifically, `idx1` is -1 and `idx2` is a non-negative integer. If `l2[i + p2] == a1` was true for any `i`, then `idx2` is set to that `i` value, and `p2` is set to 1. If none of the conditions involving `l1[i + p1] == a2` were met throughout the loop, `idx1` remains -1, and `p1` remains 0. All other variables (`_`, `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`) retain their initial values. `val` is now an empty list.**
