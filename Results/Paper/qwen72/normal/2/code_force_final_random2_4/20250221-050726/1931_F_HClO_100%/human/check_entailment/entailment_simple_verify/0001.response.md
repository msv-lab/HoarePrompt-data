### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Checks**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of participants `n` and the number of screenshots `m`.
   - If `m` is 1, it directly prints "yes" because a single screenshot always corresponds to some order. This is correct.

2. **Processing the First Two Screenshots**:
   - The program reads the first two screenshots and extracts the lists `l1` and `l2` (excluding the author of the screenshot).
   - It checks if the lists `l11` (filtered `l1` to exclude `a2`) and `l22` (filtered `l2` to exclude `a1`) are equal. If they are not, it prints "no" and continues to the next test case. This check ensures that the first two screenshots can be derived from the same underlying order, which is a necessary condition.

3. **Finding the Insertion Points**:
   - The program initializes indices `idx1` and `idx2` to -1 and iterates through the lists `l1` and `l2` to find the positions where `a2` and `a1` should be inserted to make the lists match.
   - It updates the indices and positions based on the conditions found during the iteration. This step is crucial for constructing a consistent order.

4. **Handling the Insertions**:
   - Depending on the values of `idx1` and `idx2`, it inserts `a2` into `l2` or `a1` into `l1` to create a consistent order.
   - If `m` is 2, it prints "yes" and continues to the next test case. This is correct because with only two screenshots, the program has already validated that they can be derived from the same order.

5. **Validating Remaining Screenshots**:
   - For the remaining screenshots, it reads each one and checks if the list `l3` (excluding the author `a3`) matches the constructed list `l`.
   - If any screenshot does not match, it prints "no" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If all screenshots match, it prints "yes". This step ensures that all screenshots are consistent with the constructed order.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the initial checks and the processing of the first two screenshots.
- It correctly identifies the insertion points and constructs the consistent order.
- It validates the remaining screenshots against the constructed order and prints the appropriate result.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and constraints.

Final: **True**
