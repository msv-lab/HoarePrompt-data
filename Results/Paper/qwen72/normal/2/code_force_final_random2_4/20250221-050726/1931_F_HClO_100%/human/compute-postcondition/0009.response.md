The code snippet `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a2` and the rest to the list `l2`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 0
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` and `m` are input integers
- `a1` is the first integer from the input
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input

After executing the code snippet, the new state is:

- `_` is 0
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` and `m` are input integers
- `a1` is the first integer from the input
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input

Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.**
