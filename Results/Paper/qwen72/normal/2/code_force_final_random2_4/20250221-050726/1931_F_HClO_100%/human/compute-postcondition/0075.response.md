The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `val`. This operation does not affect any of the existing variables or their values. The initial state remains unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `val`.

Output State: **_ is 0, t is greater than 0, n is greater than 1, m are input integers, a1 is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of the remaining integers from the input, a2 is the first integer from the new input, l2 is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, l11 is a list containing elements from l1 excluding a2, l22 is a list containing elements from l2 excluding a1, i is n-2, idx1 and idx2 are either non-negative or -1, p1 and p2 are either 1 or 0, val is an empty list.**
