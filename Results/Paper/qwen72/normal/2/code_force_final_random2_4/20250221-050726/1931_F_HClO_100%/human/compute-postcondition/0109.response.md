The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` being less than `m - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `m` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 1), and `m` must still be greater than 2 (which means `m - 2` must be greater than 1).

State: **`_` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to its previous contents.**
