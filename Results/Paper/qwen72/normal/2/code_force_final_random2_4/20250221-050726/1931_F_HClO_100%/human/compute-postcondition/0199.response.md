Postcondition: ***`_` is `m-2`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the last tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `m` is an input integer and is at least 3, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is 2 and `p1` is 1. If `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx2` is 2 and `p2` is 1. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
