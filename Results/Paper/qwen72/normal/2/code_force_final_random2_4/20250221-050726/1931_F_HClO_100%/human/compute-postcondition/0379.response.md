The only objects in the loop head are `a3` and `l3`, which are elements of the list `val`. The loop iterates over each tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another tuple in `val` to process.

At the end of the last iteration, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples, and the last processed tuple was the second tuple in `val`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more tuple in `val` to process, making the total number of tuples in `val` at least `m-1`.

Since the loop is about to process the next tuple, the next values of `a3` and `l3` will be the third tuple in `val`.

State: **`m` is greater than 2, `val` is a list containing at least `m-1` tuples `(a3, l3)`, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `a3` and `l3` are the third tuple in `val`, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the third user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions encountered during the loop, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`. If `l3` is not equal to a list of elements from `l` excluding `a3`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**
