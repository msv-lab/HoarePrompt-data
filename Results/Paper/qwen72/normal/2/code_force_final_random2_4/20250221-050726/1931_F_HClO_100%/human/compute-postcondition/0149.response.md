Postcondition: ***`_` is `m-2`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the last tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the user input has been consumed and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
