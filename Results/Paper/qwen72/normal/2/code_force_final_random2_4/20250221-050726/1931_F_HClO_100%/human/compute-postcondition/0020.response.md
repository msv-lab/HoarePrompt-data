Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is `m-3`
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` and `m` are input integers
- `a1` is the first integer from the input
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`
- `m` must be greater than 2
- `l11` and `l22` are not equal

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('no')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
