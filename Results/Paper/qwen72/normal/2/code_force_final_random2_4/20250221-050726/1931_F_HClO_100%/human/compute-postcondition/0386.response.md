Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by the number of chat participants `n` and the number of participants who posted screenshots `k`. For each test case, it reads the order of participants shown to each screenshot author and determines whether the order of participants can be consistently aligned across all screenshots. If the orders are consistent, the function prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that all test cases have been evaluated and the appropriate 'yes' or 'no' responses have been printed for each. **
