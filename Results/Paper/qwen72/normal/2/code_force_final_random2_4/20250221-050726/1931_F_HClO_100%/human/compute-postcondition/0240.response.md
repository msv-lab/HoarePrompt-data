Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` as its last element, and `val` has one more element than before.**

Explanation:
- The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`.
- The initial state specifies that `a3` is the first integer from the new input and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input. This remains true after the code execution.
- The initial state also specifies that `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` as its last element, and `val` has one more element than before. This remains unchanged.
- The condition that `m` must be greater than 3 is not affected by the code execution and remains true.
