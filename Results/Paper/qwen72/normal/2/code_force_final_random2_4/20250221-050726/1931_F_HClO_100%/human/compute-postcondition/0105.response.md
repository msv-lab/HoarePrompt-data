Postcondition: **_ is 0, t is greater than 0, n is greater than 1, m are input integers, a1 is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of the remaining integers from the input, a2 is the first integer from the new input, l2 is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, l11 is a list containing elements from l1 excluding a2, l22 is a list containing elements from l2 excluding a1, i is n-2, idx1 and idx2 are either non-negative or -1 (with idx2 set to n-2 if idx2 was -1 and idx1 is non-negative), p1 and p2 are either 1 or 0, val is a list. If idx1 < idx2, l2 has a2 inserted at index idx1, and l is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with a2 inserted at index idx1. If idx1 >= idx2, l1 has a1 inserted at index idx2, and l is now equal to l1. If idx1 <= idx2, m is an input integer - 1, and val is a list containing the tuple (a3, l3), where a3 is the first integer from the new input, and l3 is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.**
