Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is 0, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, `idx1` is 0, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, and both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative (i.e., `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
