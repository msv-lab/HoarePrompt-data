Output State: **`m` is greater than 2, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)`, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `a3` and `l3` are the second tuple in `val`, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the third user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions encountered during the loop, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
