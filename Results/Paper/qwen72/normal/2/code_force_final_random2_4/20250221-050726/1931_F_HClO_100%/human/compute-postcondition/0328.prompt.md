Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `m` is greater than 2, `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, and the program prints 'yes'. `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user through `input()`. `a1` is assigned the first integer from the user input, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input. `a2` is assigned the first integer from the new user input, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input. `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`. `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is `m-3`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `l11` is equal to `l22`, the program continues with the next steps in the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`m` is greater than 2, `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, the program prints 'yes', `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is assigned the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is assigned the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, and `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `idx2` is set to `i`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, then `p1` is set to 1, `p2` is set to 0, `idx1` is set to `i`, and `idx2` is set to -1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither of these conditions is met, the values of `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain unchanged, and the program continues executing the next part of the loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`m` is greater than 2, `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, the program prints 'yes', `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is assigned the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is assigned the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 1. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, and `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` are all set to `n - 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain unchanged, and if `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`m` is greater than 2, `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, the program prints 'yes', `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is assigned the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is assigned the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is `n`. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then: if `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `n`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If only `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx1` is set to `n` and `p1` is incremented by 1. If only `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx2` is set to `n` and `p2` is incremented by 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If none of these conditions are met, the program continues executing.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
