Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 2, `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, the program prints 'yes', `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is assigned the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is assigned the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, then `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is `i`, and `idx2` is -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain unchanged, and the program continues executing the next part of the loop or if statement.***
