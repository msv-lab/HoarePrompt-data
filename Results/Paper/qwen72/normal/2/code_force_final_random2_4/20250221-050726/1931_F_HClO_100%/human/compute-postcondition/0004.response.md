The `input()` function is called, which waits for user input. Since no variable is assigned the result of `input()`, the input itself does not affect the state of the program. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, and the current value of `m` is 1.**
