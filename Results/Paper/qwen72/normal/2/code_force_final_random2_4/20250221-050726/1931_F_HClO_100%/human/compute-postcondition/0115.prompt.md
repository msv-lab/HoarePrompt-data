Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 0, t is greater than 0, n is greater than 1, m are input integers, a1 is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of the remaining integers from the input, a2 is the first integer from the new input, l2 is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, l11 is a list containing elements from l1 excluding a2, l22 is a list containing elements from l2 excluding a1, i is n-2, idx1 and idx2 are either non-negative or -1 (with idx2 set to n-2 if idx2 was -1 and idx1 is non-negative), p1 and p2 are either 1 or 0, val is a list. If idx1 < idx2, l2 has a2 inserted at index idx1, and l is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with a2 inserted at index idx1. If idx1 >= idx2, l1 has a1 inserted at index idx2, and l is now equal to l1. If idx1 <= idx2, m is an input integer - 1, and val is a list containing the tuple (a3, l3), where a3 is the first integer from the new input, and l3 is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 0, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to its previous contents.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to its previous contents.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 2, `m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to its previous contents.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
