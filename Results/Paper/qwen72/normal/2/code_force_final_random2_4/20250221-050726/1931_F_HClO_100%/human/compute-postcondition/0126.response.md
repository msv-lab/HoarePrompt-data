The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'no'`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is `m-3`, where `m` is at least 3.
- `a3` and `l3` will be set by the third tuple in `val`, and `val` is a list containing at least three tuples.

However, none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'no'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **no**
