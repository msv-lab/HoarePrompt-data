Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, it does not correctly handle cases where the order of participants is such that the insertion points for the authors of the screenshots are not clearly defined. Here is a specific example where the program fails:

### Input:
```
1
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 1 4 5
3 2 1 4 5
```

### Expected Output:
```
YES
```

### Actual Output:
```
NO
```

### Explanation:
In this case, the order of participants is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The first user sees `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the second user sees `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]`, and the third user sees `[3, 2, 1, 4, 5]`. All these orders are consistent with the original order `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

However, the program incorrectly outputs `NO` because it fails to correctly handle the insertion points for the authors of the screenshots. Specifically, the logic for determining the insertion points and comparing the lists is flawed, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
