The only variable in the loop head is `m`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `m`. The loop will execute as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must still be at least 3, because `m - 2` must be greater than 0.

However, since the loop does not modify `m` and it is not incremented or decremented within the loop, the state of `m` remains unchanged. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`m` is at least 3, and user input has been consumed.**
