The code snippet `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a tuple containing the values of `a3` and `l3` to the list `val`. Since `val` was not mentioned in the initial state, it is assumed to be an existing list. The values of `_`, `m`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to its previous contents.**
