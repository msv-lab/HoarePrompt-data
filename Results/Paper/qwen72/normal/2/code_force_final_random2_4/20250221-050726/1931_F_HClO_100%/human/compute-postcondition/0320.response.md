Output State: **`m` is greater than 2, `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, the program prints 'yes', `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is assigned the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is assigned the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is `n`, `idx1` is `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `p1` is 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
