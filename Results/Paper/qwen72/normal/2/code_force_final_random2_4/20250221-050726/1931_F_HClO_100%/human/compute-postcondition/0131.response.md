Output State: **`_` is `m-2`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the last tuple in `val`, and `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples. `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`.
- The initial state variables `_`, `a3`, `l3`, and `val` remain unchanged.
- The new values of `n` and `m` are taken from the input, so they are now input integers.
