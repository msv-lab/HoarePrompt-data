Output State: **_ is m-3, m is greater than 2, a3 is the first integer from the new input, l3 is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, val is a list containing m-2 tuples, each tuple consisting of (a3, l3) from each iteration.**

### Explanation:
- `_` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration. After `m-2` iterations, `_` will be `m-3`.
- `m` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute at least once, and it remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `a3` and `l3` are updated in each iteration with the first integer and the remaining integers from the new input, respectively.
- `val` is a list that accumulates tuples `(a3, l3)` from each iteration. After `m-2` iterations, `val` will contain `m-2` such tuples.
