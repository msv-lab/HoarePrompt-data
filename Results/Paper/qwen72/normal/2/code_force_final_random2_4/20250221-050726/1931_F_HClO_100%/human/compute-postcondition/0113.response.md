Output State: **`_` is 2, `m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to its previous contents.**

Explanation:
- The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`.
- The initial state specifies that `a3` is the first integer from the new input, and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.
- The initial state also mentions that `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to its previous contents, which remains unchanged.
- The values of `_` and `m` are not affected by this code, so they remain as specified in the initial state.
