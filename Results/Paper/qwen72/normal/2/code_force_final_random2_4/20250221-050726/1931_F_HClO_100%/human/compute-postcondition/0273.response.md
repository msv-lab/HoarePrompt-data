Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is `m-3`**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `m` remains greater than or equal to 3, as it was initially required to be for the loop to run at least once. The loop counter `_` will have the value `m-3`, which means it has completed all the iterations from 0 up to `m-3`, totaling `m-2` iterations. This is consistent with the loop running `m-2` times, as specified in the loop's range.
