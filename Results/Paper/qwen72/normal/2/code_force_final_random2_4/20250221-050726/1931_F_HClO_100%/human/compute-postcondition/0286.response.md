Output State: **`m` is greater than 2, `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, the program prints 'yes', `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is assigned the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is assigned the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in, but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged except for the fact that the loop or if statement is exited.
