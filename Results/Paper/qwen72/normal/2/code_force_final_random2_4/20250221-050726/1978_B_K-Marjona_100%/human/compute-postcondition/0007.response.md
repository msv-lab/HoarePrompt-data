Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is greater than `a`, `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.***
