Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns under the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually, which matches the problem statement.

2. **Choosing `k`**: The program sets `k` to `min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and also does not exceed the difference between `b` and `a`, which is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price without making the modified price less than the usual price `a`.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is simply `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the profit is calculated as the sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns plus the usual price for the remaining `(n - k)` buns. The formula `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns, and `(n - k) * a` calculates the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated profit for each test case, which is the expected output format.

Given these points, the program correctly solves the problem as described.
