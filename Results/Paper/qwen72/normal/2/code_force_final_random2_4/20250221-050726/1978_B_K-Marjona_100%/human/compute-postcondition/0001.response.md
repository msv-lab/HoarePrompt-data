The code snippet `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` after converting them to integers. The initial state specifies that `_` is 0 and `int(input())` must be greater than 0, but since `int(input())` is not used directly in this code snippet, we only consider the input for `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.**
