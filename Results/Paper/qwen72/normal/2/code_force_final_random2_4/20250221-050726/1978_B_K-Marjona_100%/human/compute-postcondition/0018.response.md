Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `_` is 2 (This variable is not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

### Conditions:
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition `b <= a` holds true.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, the condition `b > a` holds true.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine the value of `k`:**
   - `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
   - If `b <= a`, then `b - a` is non-positive, so `k` will be 0 because `min(n, b - a)` will be `min(n, 0) = 0`.
   - If `b > a`, then `b - a` is positive, so `k` will be the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

2. **Evaluate the expression inside the `print` statement:**
   - The expression is `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

3. **Case 1: `b <= a`**
   - In this case, `k = 0`.
   - Substituting `k = 0` into the expression:
     \[
     b * 0 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (n - 0) * a = 0 - 0 + n * a = n * a
     \]
   - Therefore, the output will be `n * a`.

4. **Case 2: `b > a`**
   - In this case, `k = min(n, b - a)`.
   - Let's denote `k` as `min(n, b - a)`.
   - Substituting `k` into the expression:
     \[
     b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a
     \]
   - This expression can be broken down as follows:
     - `b * k` is the product of `b` and `k`.
     - `k * (k - 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `k-1` integers.
     - `(n - k) * a` is the product of `n - k` and `a`.

### Final Output:
- If `b <= a`, the output will be `n * a`.
- If `b > a`, the output will be `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, where `k = min(n, b - a)`.

Output: **b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a (where k is the minimum of n and b - a)**

This output covers both cases and provides the most precise description based on the initial state.
