Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the input string `s` directly using `input()`. This is appropriate for the problem since the input is expected to be a single line containing a balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Balance Calculation**: The variable `balance` is used to keep track of the balance of the parentheses sequence as it iterates through the string. For each character:
   - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
   - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   This correctly computes the balance of the prefix up to the current character.

3. **Details Collection**: The function collects the balance, the negative index, and the character itself in a list called `details`. Using the negative index ensures that when sorting, characters with the same balance will be ordered in decreasing order of their original positions.

4. **Sorting**: The `details` list is sorted based on the balance and the negative index. This ensures that the columns are sorted in increasing order of prefix balance and, within the same balance, in decreasing order of position.

5. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the function constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted `details` list and joining them together.

6. **Output**: The result string is printed, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

Given the steps and the logic, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
