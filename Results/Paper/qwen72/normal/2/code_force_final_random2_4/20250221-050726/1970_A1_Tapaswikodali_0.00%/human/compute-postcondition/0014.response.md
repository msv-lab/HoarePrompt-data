Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it should be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. `i` is 1, `char` is the second character in `s`. If `char` is '(', `balance` is 2. If `char` is ')', `balance` is -2. `details` is a list containing the tuples `(balance, 0, char)` and `(balance, -1, char)`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `s` is a non-empty string of balanced parentheses, `i` is 1, and `char` is the second character in `s`.
- The value of `balance` depends on the value of `char`: if `char` is '(', `balance` is 2; if `char` is ')', `balance` is -2.
- The initial `details` list contains the tuple `(balance, 0, char)`.
- The code appends a new tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the `details` list.
- Since `i` is 1, the new tuple appended is `(balance, -1, char)`.
- Therefore, the updated `details` list now contains two tuples: `(balance, 0, char)` and `(balance, -1, char)`.
