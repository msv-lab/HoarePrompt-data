The code snippet `details.sort()` sorts the list `details` based on the tuples contained within it. The sorting is done in ascending order by default, first by the `balance` value, then by the `-i` value (which is the negative index), and finally by the `char` value.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string of balanced parentheses with a length not exceeding 500,000.
- `i` is the index of the last character in `s`, which is `len(s) - 1`.
- `char` is the last character in `s`.
- `balance` is 0.
- `details` is a list of tuples `(balance, -i, char)` for each character in `s`.

After sorting `details`:
- The list `details` will be sorted primarily by the `balance` value in ascending order.
- If two tuples have the same `balance` value, they will be sorted by the `-i` value in ascending order.
- If two tuples have the same `balance` and `-i` values, they will be sorted by the `char` value in ascending order.

Since the `balance` value starts at 0 and changes as the parentheses are processed, the sorting will ensure that tuples with lower `balance` values come first. The `-i` value ensures that characters are sorted by their position in the string, and the `char` value will be either '(' or ')'.

The other variables (`s`, `i`, `char`, and `balance`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of balanced parentheses with a length not exceeding 500,000, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `char` is the last character in `s`, `balance` is 0, and `details` is a sorted list of tuples `(balance, -i, char)` for each character in `s`, sorted primarily by `balance` in ascending order, then by `-i` in ascending order, and finally by `char` in ascending order.**
