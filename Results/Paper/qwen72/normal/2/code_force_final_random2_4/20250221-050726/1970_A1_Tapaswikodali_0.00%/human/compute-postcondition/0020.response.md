Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it should be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The variable `i` is the index of the last character in `s`, which is `len(s) - 1`. The variable `char` is the last character in `s`. The variable `balance` is 0 because the parentheses sequence is balanced. The variable `details` is a list containing tuples for each character in `s`, where each tuple is in the form `(balance, -i, char)`, representing the balance after processing the character at position `i`, the negative index `-i`, and the character itself.**
