The code snippet `data = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `data`.

Given the initial state:
- `times` must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer

After executing the code, the variable `data` will contain a list of integers provided by the user. The values of `times` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
