The provided Python code snippet is:

```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
- **Initial State**: 
  - `t` is greater than 1.
  - `i` is 1.
  - `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input.
  - If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd.

### Explanation:
- The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `i`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Alice'`.

### Output:
Output: **Alice**
