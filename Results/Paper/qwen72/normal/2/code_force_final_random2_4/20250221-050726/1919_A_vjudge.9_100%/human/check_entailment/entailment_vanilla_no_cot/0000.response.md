Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have. The logic behind the solution is that if the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, then Bob will win, and if it is odd, Alice will win. This is because the game essentially reduces to a parity game where the players are trying to force the other into a position where they cannot make a move. The solution handles all the test cases correctly as per the problem statement.
