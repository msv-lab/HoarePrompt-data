The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `t` must still be greater than `i` (so `t` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd.**
