Reasoning:  
The logic implemented in the function is based on the observation that the game's outcome depends on the parity (even or odd nature) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the absolute difference is even, Bob wins; if it's odd, Alice wins. This is because, in each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not, and then remove one coin. The parity of the difference in the number of coins determines whether the player who starts (Alice) can force a win or not.

However, the logic in the program assumes that the player with more coins will always be able to force a win if the difference is odd, which is correct under optimal play. The key insight here is that the player with the higher number of coins can always maintain the parity of the difference by choosing to swap or not swap accordingly, ensuring that the player with fewer coins is eventually forced into a losing position when the difference is odd.

The program correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, and then determines the winner based on the parity of the difference.

Given the constraints and the rules of the game, the program's logic is sound and should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
