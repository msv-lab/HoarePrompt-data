Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem by determining the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. Here's why:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is an efficient way to handle multiple test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it extracts the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.

3. **Counting Facing-Up Coins**: It counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s`.

4. **Determining the Winner**: The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins:
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always have the last move and thus win.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will have the last move and thus win.

5. **Storing and Printing Results**: The program stores the results for each test case in a list and prints them at the end.

This logic is correct and matches the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
