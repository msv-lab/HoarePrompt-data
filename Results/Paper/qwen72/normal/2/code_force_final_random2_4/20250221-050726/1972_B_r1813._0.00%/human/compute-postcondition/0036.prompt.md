Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function reads from standard input, but does not modify any variables or states directly. The initial state remains unchanged: The function should accept multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins. The total number of test cases t is also provided, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. The input data is split into a list called `data`. `index` is 1. `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    s = data[index]
    index += 1
    num_up_coins = s.count('U')
    if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is the value of `data[2]`, `num_up_coins` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `s`. If `num_up_coins` is odd, `results` is a list containing one element 'YES'. If `num_up_coins` is even, `results` is a list containing one element 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `index` is 5, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `s` is the value of `data[4]`, `num_up_coins` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `s`. If `num_up_coins` is odd, `results` is a list containing two elements ['YES', 'YES'] or ['YES', 'NO']. If `num_up_coins` is even, `results` is a list containing two elements ['NO', 'YES'] or ['NO', 'NO'].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `index` is 7, `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`, `s` is the value of `data[6]`, `num_up_coins` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `s` (which is the value of `data[6]`). If `num_up_coins` is odd, `results` is a list containing three elements: either ['YES', 'YES', 'YES'], ['YES', 'NO', 'YES'], ['YES', 'YES', 'NO'], or ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']. If `num_up_coins` is even, `results` is a list containing three elements: either ['NO', 'YES', 'YES'], ['NO', 'NO', 'YES'], ['NO', 'YES', 'NO'], or ['NO', 'NO', 'NO'].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
