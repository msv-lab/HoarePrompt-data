The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result for each case. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, the function counts the number of "U" characters in the string `s`. If the count is odd, it appends "YES" to the results list; otherwise, it appends "NO". After processing all test cases, the function prints each result in the results list. The final state of the program is that the results list contains exactly `t` elements, each being "YES" if the corresponding count of "U" was odd, or "NO" if it was even, and these results have been printed to the standard output.
