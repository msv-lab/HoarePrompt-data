The function `solve_coin_game` is expected to read input from stdin where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), the number of test cases. Each of the following t test cases consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins.
