The value of `n` is assigned the integer conversion of the element at index 1 of the list `data`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list. After executing the code, the value of `n` is determined by the second element of `data` (since indexing starts at 0), and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
