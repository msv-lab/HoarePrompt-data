Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `results` contains exactly `t` elements, each being 'YES' if the corresponding `num_up_coins` was odd, or 'NO' if it was even. The loop has printed each element in `results` exactly once.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop completes its execution, the variable `t` is still greater than 0, and the list `results` contains exactly `t` elements, where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the corresponding `num_up_coins` was odd or even. The loop has printed each element in `results` exactly once, so the final output will be the sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' values as they appear in `results`.
