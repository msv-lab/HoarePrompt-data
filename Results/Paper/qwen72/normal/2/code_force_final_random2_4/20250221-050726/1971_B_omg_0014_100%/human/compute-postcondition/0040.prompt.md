You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the same as the initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the last input `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, `b` and `c` are undefined. Otherwise, `b` is a string containing the characters from the last input `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is a string containing the characters from the last input `s` sorted in descending order. If the last input `s` is equal to `b`, then `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b`, and `s` is now the last user input.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), and each test case includes a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the processing of the string `s`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
