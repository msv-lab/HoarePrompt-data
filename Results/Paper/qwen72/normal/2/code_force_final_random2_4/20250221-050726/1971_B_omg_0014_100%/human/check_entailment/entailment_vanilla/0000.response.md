### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case.

2. **Set Creation and Uniqueness Check**: For each string `s`, it creates a set `a` from the characters of `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, it means all characters in `s` are the same, and thus it's impossible to rearrange `s` to form a different string. In this case, the function correctly prints 'NO'.

3. **Sorting and Reversing**: If the length of `a` is greater than 1, the function proceeds to sort the string `s` in both ascending and descending order. This is done using `b = ''.join(sorted(s))` and `c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))`.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - If the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`, it means sorting in ascending order did not change the string. In this case, the function prints the reversed string `c`.
   - If `b` is not equal to `s`, it means sorting in ascending order produced a different string, and the function prints `b`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For strings with all unique characters, the function will always produce a different string by sorting.
   - For strings with some repeated characters but not all the same, the function will also produce a different string by sorting or reversing.

6. **Output Format**: The function correctly outputs 'YES' followed by the rearranged string when a valid rearrangement is possible, and 'NO' when it is not.
