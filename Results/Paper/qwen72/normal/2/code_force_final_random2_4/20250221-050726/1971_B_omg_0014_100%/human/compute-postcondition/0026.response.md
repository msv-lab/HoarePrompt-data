Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, `b` and `c` are undefined. Otherwise, `b` is a string containing the characters from the new `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is a string containing the characters from the new `s` sorted in descending order. If `s` is equal to `b`, then `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b`.***
