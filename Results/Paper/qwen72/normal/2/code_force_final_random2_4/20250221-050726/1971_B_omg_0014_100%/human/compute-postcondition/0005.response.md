Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is a set containing the unique characters from `s`, and the length of `a` is 1.

Given this information, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
