### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting and Reversing:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This ensures that the largest elements are considered first when Alice removes elements and when Bob multiplies elements by -1. However, this approach might not always be optimal because it does not consider the negative impact of removing large positive elements when smaller negative elements could be removed instead.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The initial sum of the array `sum1` is calculated correctly.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The function iterates over possible values of `i` from 0 to `k` (inclusive), where `i` represents the number of elements Alice removes.
   - For each `i`:
     - If `i` is 0, the sum is adjusted by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements (since Bob will multiply these by -1).
     - If `i` is greater than 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, the sum is adjusted by adding the `i-1`th element and subtracting twice the `i + x - 1`th element.
     - If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, the sum is adjusted by adding the `i-1`th element.

5. **Result Calculation:**
   - The maximum value from the list `ans` is printed for each test case, which represents the optimal sum after both players play optimally.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Strategy:**
  - Alice's strategy should be to remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. However, the current implementation sorts the array in descending order, which means it considers removing the largest elements first. This is incorrect because removing large positive elements can lead to a suboptimal solution.
  - Bob's strategy is to multiply the largest remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum. This part of the strategy is correct.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles edge cases such as when `k` or `x` is 0, and when the array has only one element. However, the sorting in descending order might still lead to incorrect results in some edge cases.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\) time, and the main loop runs in \(O(k)\) time, making the overall complexity manageable within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice. Sorting the array in descending order and considering the removal of the largest elements first is incorrect. Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
