The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `ans` now contains one additional element, which is the current value of `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the user-provided integer, `k` is the user-provided integer, `x` is the user-provided integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` followed by the new value of `sums`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. The list `ans` now includes the current value of `sums` as its last element.**
