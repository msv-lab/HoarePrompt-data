The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` is the new user-provided integer
- `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative
- `x` is the new user-provided integer
- `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `i` is `k`
- `ans` is a list containing one element. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, `ans` contains the value of `sums`.
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`

After executing `ans.append(sums)`, the value of `sums` is appended to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new user-provided integer, `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative, `x` is the new user-provided integer, `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k`, `ans` is a list containing two elements (the first element is the same as before, and the second element is the current value of `sums`), `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
