The code snippet modifies the value of `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. Let's break down the impact:

- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an integer provided by the user input.
- `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 0.
- `x` is an integer provided by the user input.
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input.
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `i` is not 0.
- The current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.

After executing the code snippet, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 0, `x` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is not 0, the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
