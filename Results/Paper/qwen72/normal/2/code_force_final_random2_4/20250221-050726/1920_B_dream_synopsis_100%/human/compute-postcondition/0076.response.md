Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the user-provided integer, `k` is the user-provided integer, `x` is the user-provided integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, and the new value of `sums` is appended to the list `ans`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`, and the list `ans` now includes the current value of `sums` as its last element.***
