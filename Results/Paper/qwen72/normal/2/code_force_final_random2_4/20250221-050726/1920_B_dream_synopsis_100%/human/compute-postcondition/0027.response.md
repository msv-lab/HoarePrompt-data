Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 0, `x` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` (if `i` was 0) or the value of `sums` (if `i` was not 0). If `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` is extended with the value of `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]` and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`. Otherwise, `ans` is extended with the value of `sums + a[0]` and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0]`. `i` is 1, and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again.**
