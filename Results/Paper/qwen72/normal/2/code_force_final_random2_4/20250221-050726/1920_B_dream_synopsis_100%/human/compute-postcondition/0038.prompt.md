Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 0, `x` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 0, `x` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is 1, and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again. If `i` was 0, `ans` is a list containing the values `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), sums]`, and `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` was not 0 and `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` is extended with the value of `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]` and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`. If `i` was not 0 and `i + x - 1 >= n`, `ans` is extended with the value of `sums + a[0]` and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 1, `x` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is 2, and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again. If `i` was 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `ans` is a list containing the values `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`. If `i` was not 0 and `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sum1 + a[1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` and `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 + a[1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i` was not 0 and `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1]` and `ans` now includes the value of `sums`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
