Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new user-provided integer, `k` is the new user-provided integer, `x` is the new user-provided integer, `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, where the first element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and subsequent elements are updated based on the conditions within the loop.**

Explanation:
- The code `sum1 = sum(a)` updates the value of `sum1` to be the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `sum1` is now explicitly defined as the sum of the elements in `a`.
- The structure of `ans` remains as described in the initial state, with the first element being `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and subsequent elements being updated based on the conditions within the loop.
