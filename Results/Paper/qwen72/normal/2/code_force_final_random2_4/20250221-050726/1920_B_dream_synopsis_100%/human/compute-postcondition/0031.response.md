The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Since `ans` initially contains the value `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`, appending `sums` (which is also `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`) to `ans` results in `ans` containing two identical values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 1, `x` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is 2, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `ans` is a list containing the values `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`.**
