    #State: The loop will terminate when `l > r` or `k == 0`. At this point, `sunks` will be the total number of successful operations performed (either by decrementing `k` by `2 * a[l]` or `2 * a[r]` and updating the corresponding elements in `a`). The values of `l` and `r` will reflect the indices that were processed during the loop, with `l` potentially being greater than `r` if the loop terminated due to `l` exceeding `r`. The value of `k` will be the remaining amount after all possible operations, which could be 0 if all operations were successful. The array `a` will be modified based on the operations performed, with some elements possibly reduced to 0 or removed from consideration by adjusting `l` and `r`.
    return sunks
    #The program returns the total number of successful operations (`sunks`) performed, which involves decrementing `k` by `2 * a[l]` or `2 * a[r]` and updating the corresponding elements in the array `a`. The exact value of `sunks` depends on the initial values of `l`, `r`, `k`, and the elements in `a`, but it represents the count of times the operation was successfully applied before the loop terminated.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the length of the list `a`), `k` (a positive integer), and `a` (a list of positive integers). It returns the total number of successful operations (`sunks`) performed. Each operation involves decrementing `k` by `2 * a[l]` or `2 * a[r]` and updating the corresponding elements in the array `a`. The function processes the elements of `a` from both ends (using indices `l` and `r`), performing operations until either `k` reaches 0 or the indices `l` and `r` cross each other. The final state of the program includes the updated value of `k` (which could be 0 if all operations were successful), the modified array `a` (with some elements possibly reduced to 0), and the total count of successful operations (`sunks`).
