Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the initial condition, `k` is updated to `k - a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[l]` is decremented by the value of `a[r]`.
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - a[r] * 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `l`, `r`) retain their initial conditions.
