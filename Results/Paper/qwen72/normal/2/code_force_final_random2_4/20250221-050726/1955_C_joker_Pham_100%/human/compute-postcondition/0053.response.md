Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, and `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the condition. If `a[r] * 2 == k`, then `sunks` is now 1, 2, or 3 (depending on its initial value), `k` is 0, and the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sunks` remains either 0, 1, or 2, `k` is 0, and the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. In both cases, the value of `a[r]` is less than the value of `a[l]`, and `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`.***
