Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `sunks` is either 1, 2, or 3, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, `k` is `k - 2 * a[r]`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - a[r]`, if `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is either 1 or 2, `sunks` is either 2, 3, or 4, and `a[l]` is 0. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
