Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the condition, and `sunks` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. `k` is updated to `k - (a[r] * 2)`. If `k` was 0 before the operation, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `a[r] * 2` from its current value.
- The value of `r` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the condition, so `a[r]` is one of the last elements in the list `a`.
- If `k` was 0 before the operation, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `l`, `sunks`) remain unchanged.
