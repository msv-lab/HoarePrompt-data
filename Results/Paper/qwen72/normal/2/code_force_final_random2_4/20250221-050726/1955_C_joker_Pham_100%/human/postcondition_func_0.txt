The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the length of the list `a`), `k` (a positive integer), and `a` (a list of positive integers). It returns the total number of successful operations (`sunks`) performed. Each operation involves decrementing `k` by `2 * a[l]` or `2 * a[r]` and updating the corresponding elements in the array `a`. The function processes the elements of `a` from both ends (using indices `l` and `r`), performing operations until either `k` reaches 0 or the indices `l` and `r` cross each other. The final state of the program includes the updated value of `k` (which could be 0 if all operations were successful), the modified array `a` (with some elements possibly reduced to 0), and the total count of successful operations (`sunks`).
