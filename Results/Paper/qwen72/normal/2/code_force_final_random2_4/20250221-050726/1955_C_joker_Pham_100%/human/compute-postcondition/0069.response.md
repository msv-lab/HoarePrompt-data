Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` - 2 * `a[l]` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the condition, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is decremented by 1 (making `r` either `n - 2`, `n - 3`, or `n - 4`), and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `l` equals `r`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
