Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, and `r` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the initial condition. If `k >= a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is updated to `k - a[r+1] * 2`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r+1]`, and if `a[l]` becomes 0, `sunks` is set to 1. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `k < a[r] * 2` and `a[r] * 2 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k < a[r] * 2` and `a[r] * 2 != k`, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
