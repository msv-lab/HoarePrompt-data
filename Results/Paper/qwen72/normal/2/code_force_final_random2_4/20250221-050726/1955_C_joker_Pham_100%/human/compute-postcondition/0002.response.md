The only variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, `r` (which is `n - 1`) will always be non-negative and at least 0 when `n` is at least 1. Therefore, `l` being 0 and `r` being `n - 1` ensures that `l` is always less than or equal to `r` for the first iteration.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 0**
