The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables directly. Therefore, the state of the variables remains the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 2`, `n - 3`, or `n - 4` depending on the condition, `sunks` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` is 0, otherwise `sunks` remains unchanged.**
