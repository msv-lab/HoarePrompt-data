### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`, followed by the durability of each ship in the list `a`.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for each test case. It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships, respectively, and a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `k` becomes 0, the loop breaks, indicating no more attacks can be made.
   - If `l` equals `r`, the Kraken attacks the single remaining ship. If the remaining attacks `k` are sufficient to sink the ship, the ship is sunk, and the loop breaks.
   - If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, the Kraken attacks the first ship. If the remaining attacks `k` are sufficient to sink the first ship and attack the last ship, the necessary adjustments are made to `k`, `a[r]`, and the pointers `l` and `r`.
   - If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, the Kraken attacks the last ship. If the remaining attacks `k` are sufficient to sink the last ship and attack the first ship, the necessary adjustments are made to `k`, `a[l]`, and the pointers `l` and `r`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where `k` is exactly enough to sink a ship.
   - The program also handles cases where `k` is not enough to sink a ship, breaking the loop appropriately.

5. **Output**: The function returns the total number of ships sunk, which is stored in the variable `sunks`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as expected, processes the attacks in the correct order, and updates the state of the ships and the remaining attacks appropriately.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
