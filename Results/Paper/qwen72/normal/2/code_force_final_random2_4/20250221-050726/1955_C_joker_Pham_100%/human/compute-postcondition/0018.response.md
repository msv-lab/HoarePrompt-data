Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 1, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, `k` is `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a[r]` is 0.** 

Explanation: The value of `sunks` is incremented by 1, making it 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state, except for the updates to `k` and `a[r]` as specified in the initial state.
