The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial conditions, let's determine the new state:

- `n` and `k` remain positive integers within their specified ranges.
- `a` remains a list of `n` positive integers within their specified range.
- `l` remains either 0 or 1.
- `r` was either `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the condition. After decrementing, `r` is now either `n - 2` or `n - 3`.
- `sunks` remains either 1, 2, or 3.
- The value of `a[r]` being less than `a[l]` and the current value of `k` being `k - 2 * a[r]` remain unchanged.
- The value of `a[l]` being `a[l] - a[r]` and the condition that if `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is either 1 or 2, `sunks` is either 2, 3, or 4, and `a[l]` is 0, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `sunks` is either 1, 2, or 3, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, `k` is `k - 2 * a[r]`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - a[r]`, if `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is either 1 or 2, `sunks` is either 2, 3, or 4, and `a[l]` is 0.**
