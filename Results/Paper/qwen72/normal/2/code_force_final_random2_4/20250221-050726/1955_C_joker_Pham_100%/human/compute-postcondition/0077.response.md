Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the condition, and `sunks` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[l]`, then `l` is incremented by 1, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l-1]`. If `a[r]` becomes 0, `r` is decremented by 1 and `sunks` is incremented by 1 again. If `l` equals `r`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is less than `2 * a[l]` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither of these conditions is met and `l` equals `r`, the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
