To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(c))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation of `c` step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **`i`**: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n-1`.
2. **`n`**: Remains the first integer read from the input.
3. **`m`**: Remains the second integer read from the input.
4. **`k`**: Is the third integer read from the input minus `n * min(m, original_k)`.
5. **`l`**: Remains a sorted list of integers read from the input.
6. **`t`**: Is `n * min(m, original_k)`.
7. **`s`**: Is the minimum of `m` and `k` (which could be 0 if `k` has been fully decremented).
8. **`c`**: Is the cumulative sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `min(m, original_k)`**:
   - This is the minimum of the second integer `m` and the original value of `k` (before any modifications).

2. **Calculate `t`**:
   - `t = n * min(m, original_k)`

3. **Update `k`**:
   - `k = k - n * min(m, original_k)`
   - This means `k` is reduced by `n * min(m, original_k)`.

4. **Determine `s`**:
   - `s = min(m, k)`
   - After updating `k`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and the new value of `k`.

5. **Calculate `c`**:
   - `c` is the cumulative sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - Compute `s * (l[i] + t)`
     - Add this value to `c`.

### Final Output:
The `print(int(c))` statement will print the integer value of `c`, which is the cumulative sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

Given the initial state and the steps involved, the output will be the integer value of `c` computed as described.

Output: **int(c) (where c is the cumulative sum of s * (l[i] + t) for each iteration i from 0 to n-1, with s being the minimum of m and k, and t being n * min(m, original_k))**
