The code snippet `l.sort()` sorts the list `l` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `l` but does not affect the other variables. Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`i` is `n` (initial value), `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input, `t` is `n * s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` at each iteration, and `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.**
