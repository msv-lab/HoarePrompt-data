To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(c))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`: This means the loop has completed all its iterations.
   - `n` is the number of iterations the loop has executed.
   - `m` remains an integer read from the input.
   - `k` is `k - n * s`: This indicates that `k` is reduced by `n * s` after the loop.
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
   - `t` is `n * s`: This is the total reduction in `k` over all iterations.
   - `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` at each iteration.
   - `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` at each iteration. Since `k` is reduced by `s` in each iteration, `s` will be the same value throughout the loop if `m` is greater than or equal to `k` initially.
   - `t` is `n * s`, which is the total reduction in `k` over all iterations.
   - `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`. This means `c` is the sum of `s` multiplied by each element in `l` plus the total reduction `t`.

3. **Calculating `c`:**
   - For each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `c` is incremented by `s * (l[j] + t)`.
   - Therefore, `c` can be expressed as:
     \[
     c = s \times \left( \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (l[j] + t) \right)
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     c = s \times \left( \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} l[j] + n \times t \right)
     \]
   - Since `t` is `n * s`, we substitute `t`:
     \[
     c = s \times \left( \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} l[j] + n \times (n \times s) \right)
     \]
     \[
     c = s \times \left( \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} l[j] + n^2 \times s \right)
     \]
     \[
     c = s \times \left( \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} l[j] + n^2 \times s \right)
     \]
     \[
     c = s \times \left( \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} l[j] + n^2 \times s \right)
     \]
     \[
     c = s \times \left( \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} l[j] + n^2 \times s \right)
     \]

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(int(c))` statement will print the integer value of `c`.

Given the complexity of the formula, the exact numerical value of `c` depends on the specific values of `l`, `m`, and `k`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated integer value of `c`.

Output: **int(c) (where c is the sum of s * (l[j] + t) for each j from 0 to n-1, with s being the minimum of m and k at each iteration, t being n * s, and l being a sorted list of integers)**
