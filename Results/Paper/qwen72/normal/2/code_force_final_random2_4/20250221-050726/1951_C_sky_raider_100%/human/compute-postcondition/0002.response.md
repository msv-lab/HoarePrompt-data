The code reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, and converts each part into an integer, storing these integers in a list `l`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0.**
