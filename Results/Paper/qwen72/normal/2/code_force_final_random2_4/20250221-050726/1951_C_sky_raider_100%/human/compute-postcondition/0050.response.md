The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a new line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `l`. This replaces the previous value of `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n` (unchanged)
- `n` is the first integer read from the input
- `m` is the second integer read from the input
- `k` is the third integer read from the input
- `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input
- `t` is `n * s`
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` (which may change with each iteration)
- `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`

After executing the code snippet, the value of `l` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `t` is `n * s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, and `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.**
