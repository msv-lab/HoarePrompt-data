The code snippet `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` after converting them to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (this condition is not directly relevant to the current code snippet, but it implies that the input should be valid and contain integers)

After executing the code snippet, the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` will be assigned the values from the input. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0.**
