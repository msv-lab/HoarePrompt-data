The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer read from the input, `k` is `k - 2 * s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is `2 * s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * l[0] + s * (l[1] + t)`**
