Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains the same as the initial value for each test case, `m` remains the same as the second integer read from the input for each test case, `k` is 0 or a non-negative integer less than the initial `k` depending on how many tickets were bought, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input for each test case, `t` is the total number of tickets bought, which is equal to the initial `k` or the maximum possible tickets that can be bought within the constraints, `s` is 0 or a non-negative integer less than or equal to `m` depending on the remaining `k` at the last iteration, and `c` is the total cost of buying the tickets, calculated as the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.**
