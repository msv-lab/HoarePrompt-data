You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, x and y are strings representing integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100 and consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= x < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= y < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings, `f` is 1, and `i` is the length of `a` - 1. The elements of `a` and `b` are such that for each index `j` (0 <= j < len(a)), if `a[j]` was originally less than `b[j]` and `f` was 0 at that point, `a[j]` and `b[j]` have been swapped. Otherwise, if `a[j]` was greater than `b[j]` and `f` was 0 at that point, `f` is set to 1 but no swap occurs. If `f` was already 1, then any subsequent elements where `a[j]` > `b[j]` are swapped, and `f` remains 1 throughout the rest of the loop.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= x < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= y < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings, `f` is 1, and `i` is the length of `a` - 1, where `len(a)` is the original length of the input string `x`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= x < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= y < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings, `b` has been fully printed, `f` is 1, and `i` is the length of `b` - 1.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 1000), `x` (a string representing an integer between 1 and 10^100, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9), and `y` (a string representing an integer between 1 and 10^100, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9). The function's return value is not specified, but it is expected to perform some operation using these parameters and return a result based on that operation.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
