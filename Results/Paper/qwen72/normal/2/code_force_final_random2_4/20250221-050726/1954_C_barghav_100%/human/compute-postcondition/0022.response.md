Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= x < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= y < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `f` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, otherwise `f` is 0, and `i` is 1.***
