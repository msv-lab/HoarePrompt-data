Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= x < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= y < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings, and `i` is 2. If `f` was initially 0, then: if `a[2]` < `b[2]`, `f` is 1, and `a[2]` and `b[2]` are swapped; if `a[2]` >= `b[2]`, `f` is 1 if `a[2]` > `b[2]`, otherwise `f` remains 0. If `f` was initially not 0, then: if `a[2]` > `b[2]`, `a[2]` and `b[2]` are swapped, and `f` remains 0.***
