Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` is a string representing an integer where \(1 \leq x < 10^{100}\) and consists only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `y` is a string representing an integer where \(1 \leq y < 10^{100}\) and consists only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings.
- `b` must have at least `len(a) + 1` elements.
- `f` is 1.
- `i` is `len(a)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[i], end='')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine the length of `a` and `b`:**
   - `i` is set to `len(a)`, which means `i` is the index of the last element in `a` plus one.
   - Since `b` must have at least `len(a) + 1` elements, `b[i]` is a valid index.

2. **Value of `b[i]`:**
   - `b[i]` refers to the element in the list `b` at the index `i`.
   - Given that `i` is `len(a)`, `b[i]` is the element in `b` that is one position beyond the last element of `a`.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the character at index `i` in the list `b`.
   - Since `end=''` is used, no newline character will be added after the printed character.

### Conclusion:
The code will print the character at index `len(a)` in the list `b`.

Output: **b[len(a)] (where b[len(a)] is the character at index len(a) in the list b)**
