Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= x < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= y < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings. If `a[2]` > `b[2]`, then `a[2]` and `b[2]` are swapped. `f` remains 0, and `i` remains 2.***
