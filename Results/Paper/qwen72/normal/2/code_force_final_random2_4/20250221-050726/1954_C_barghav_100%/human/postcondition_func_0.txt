The function `func_1` reads two lines of input, each representing a string of digits (1 to 9), and processes them to ensure that the first string is lexicographically not smaller than the second string. It does this by swapping characters at corresponding positions if necessary. After processing, it prints the modified first string, followed by an empty line, and then the modified second string. The function does not return any value. The input parameter `t` is mentioned in the comments but is not used in the function.
