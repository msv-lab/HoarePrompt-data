Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= x < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= y < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings, `f` is 0, and `i` is 1. If `f` is 0 and `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, `a` and `b` swap their second elements, `f` is set to 1, and `i` remains 1. If `f` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than or equal to `b[i]`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `f` is set to 1 if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, otherwise `f` remains 0, and `i` remains 1. If `f` is not 0, the first character of `a` is greater than the first character of `b` if `a[0]` is greater than `b[0]`; otherwise, the first character of `a` is less than or equal to the first character of `b`.***
