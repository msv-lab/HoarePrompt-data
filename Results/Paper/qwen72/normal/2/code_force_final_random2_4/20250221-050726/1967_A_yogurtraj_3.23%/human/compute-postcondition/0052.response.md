The code snippet updates the value of `r` using the formula `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. Given the initial state:

- `ii` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `k` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input
- `r` is `a[0]`
- `rem` is 0
- `y` is 0
- `i` is 0
- The condition `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > k` holds true

Let's calculate the new value of `r`:

1. `a[i]` is `a[0]` because `i` is 0.
2. `k // (i + 1)` simplifies to `k // 1`, which is just `k`.

So, the new value of `r` is `a[0] + k`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `r` is `a[0] + k`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0, and the condition `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > k` holds true.**
