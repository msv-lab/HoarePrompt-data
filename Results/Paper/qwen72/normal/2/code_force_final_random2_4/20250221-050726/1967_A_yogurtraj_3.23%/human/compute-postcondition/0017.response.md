Postcondition: ***`ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is either `a[0] + k // 1` or the second element of `a`, `rem` is either `k % 1` or 0, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or 0, `i` is 0, and `k` is either 0 or `k - (a[1] - a[0])`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `r` is `a[0] + k // 1`, `rem` is `k % 1`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `k` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is `k - (a[1] - a[0])`, `r` is the second element of `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0.***
