Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0.** 

The variable `rem` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the new variable `rem`.
