The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `n` and the second part to `k`, both converted to integers. The initial state specifies that `ii` is 0 and `int(input())` must be equal to `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. However, this condition is not directly relevant to the current code snippet, which reads a new input.

Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 100.**
