The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into separate strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `ii` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input

After executing the code snippet, the variable `a` is updated to a new list of integers provided by the user input. The values of `ii`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input.**
