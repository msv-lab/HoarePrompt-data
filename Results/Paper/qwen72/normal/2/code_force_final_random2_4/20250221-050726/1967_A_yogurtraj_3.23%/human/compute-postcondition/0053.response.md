The value of `rem` is calculated as `k % (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `k % (0 + 1)`, which is `k % 1`. Since any number modulo 1 is 0, `rem` is set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `r` is `a[0] + k`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0, and the condition `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > k` holds true.**
