To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `ii` is 0.
- `n` is an integer within a specified range.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `r` is the final value of `a[i]` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` depending on the condition.
- `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` if the loop breaks, otherwise it remains 0.
- `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the loop breaks, otherwise it remains 0.
- `i` is `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking.
- `k` is 0.

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `r`:**
   - `r` is determined by the final value of `a[i]` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`.
   - Since `k` is 0, `k // (i + 1)` is also 0.
   - Therefore, `r` is simply the value of `a[i]`.

2. **Value of `rem`:**
   - `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`.
   - Since `k` is 0, `rem` is 0.

3. **Value of `y`:**
   - `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the loop breaks, otherwise it remains 0.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, `i` is `n - 1`, so `y` would be `n - 1 - (n - 1) = 0`.

4. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking.

5. **Value of `k`:**
   - `k` is 0.

### Expression in the `print` statement:
```python
(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y
```

Substituting the values:
- `r` is `a[i]`.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.

So the expression becomes:
```python
(a[i] - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + 0
```

Simplifying:
```python
(a[i] - 1) * n + 1
```

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of `(a[i] - 1) * n + 1`, where `a[i]` is the last element of the list `a` (since `i` is `n - 1`).

Output: **(a[n-1] - 1) * n + 1 (where a[n-1] is the last element of the list a)**
