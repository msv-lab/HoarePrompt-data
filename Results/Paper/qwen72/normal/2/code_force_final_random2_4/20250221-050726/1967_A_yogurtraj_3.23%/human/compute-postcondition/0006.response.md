Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `y` to 0. All other variables (`ii`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, and `rem`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
