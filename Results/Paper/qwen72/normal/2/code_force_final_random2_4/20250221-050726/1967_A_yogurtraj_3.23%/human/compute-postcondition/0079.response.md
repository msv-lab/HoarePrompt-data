Postcondition: ***`ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `rem` is either `k % 3` or 0, `i` is 2. If `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[2] + (0 - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])) // 3`, `y` is `n - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, `r` is `a[3]`, and `y` is 0.***
