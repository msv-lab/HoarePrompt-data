The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state provides several variables (`t`, `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`) with specific conditions, but none of these variables or their values are used in the `print` statement.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `i` is 0.
- `h` is an input integer.
- `w` is an input integer.
- `xa` is an input integer.
- `ya` is an input integer.
- `xb` is an input integer.
- `yb` is an input integer.
- `xa` is greater than `xb`.

However, since the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables, the output will simply be the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
