Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `xa` is an input integer, `ya` is an input integer, `xb` is an input integer, `yb` is an input integer, `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`**.

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`, divided by 2 using integer division. All other variables remain unchanged.
