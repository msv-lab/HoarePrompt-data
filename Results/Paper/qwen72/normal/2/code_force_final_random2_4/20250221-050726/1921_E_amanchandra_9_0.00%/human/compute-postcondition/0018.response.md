Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `i` is 1.
- `h` is an input integer.
- `w` is an input integer.
- `xa` is an input integer.
- `ya` is an input integer.
- `xb` is an input integer.
- `yb` is an input integer.

The provided Python code snippet is:
```python
print('Draw')
```

This code simply prints the string `'Draw'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state, it will always print the same string regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, or `yb`.

Output: **Draw**
