Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 2, `h` is the new input integer, `w` is the new input integer, `xa` is the new input integer, `ya` is the new input integer, `xb` is the new input integer, `yb` is the new input integer, `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`, `l` is `max(1, yb - x)`, `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is calculated as `min(w, yb + x)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `x`, `l`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- `x` is calculated as `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`.
- `l` is calculated as `max(1, yb - x)`.
- `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.
