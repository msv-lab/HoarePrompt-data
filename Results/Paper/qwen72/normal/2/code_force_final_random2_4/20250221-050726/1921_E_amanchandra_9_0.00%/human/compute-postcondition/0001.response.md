The code snippet reads six integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000, and `i` is 0. After executing the code, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, while the new variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are assigned the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `xa` is an input integer, `ya` is an input integer, `xb` is an input integer, `yb` is an input integer.**
