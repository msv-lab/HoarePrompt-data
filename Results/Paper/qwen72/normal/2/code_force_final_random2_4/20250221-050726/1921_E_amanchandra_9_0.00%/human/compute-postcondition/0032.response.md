Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 2, `h` is the new input integer, `w` is the new input integer, `xa` is the new input integer, `ya` is the new input integer, `xb` is the new input integer, `yb` is the new input integer, `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`, `l` is `max(1, yb - x)`**

Explanation:
- The variable `l` is assigned the value of `max(1, yb - x)`.
- The value of `x` is calculated as `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
