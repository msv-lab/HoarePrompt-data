The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. For each test case, it determines the outcome of a game between two players, Alice and Bob, based on their chip positions on a board of dimensions `h` by `w`. The function prints "Draw" if Alice's chip is initially further down the board than Bob's. Otherwise, it calculates a value `x` and uses it to determine the possible winning positions for Alice or Bob. If certain conditions are met, it prints "Alice" or "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Draw". After processing all test cases, the function ends, and the final state includes the last processed values of `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and any intermediate variables used in the calculations.
