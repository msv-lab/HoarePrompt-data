Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Functionality of `func_1`**:
   - The function separates the password into two lists: one for digits and one for letters.
   - It sorts both lists to ensure that the digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order and ensures no digit comes after a letter.
   - Finally, it constructs a sorted version of the password and compares it to the original password to check if the original password meets the criteria.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where the password consists only of letters or only of digits.
   - It correctly identifies when a digit comes after a letter.
   - It correctly identifies when the digits or letters are not in non-decreasing order.

4. **Logical Flow**:
   - The program follows the problem statement's requirements and ensures that all conditions are met.
   - The logic is sound and the conditions are checked in the correct order.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality and handle all edge cases as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
