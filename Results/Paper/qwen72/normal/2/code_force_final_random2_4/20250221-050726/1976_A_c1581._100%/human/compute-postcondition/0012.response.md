The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `password`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the remaining characters in `password`. If there are more characters left in `password`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `password` is a string of length n-1 (1 ≤ n-1 ≤ 19) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and `char` is the next character in `password`. For the loop to execute one more time, `password` must still have at least one more character left to process, making its length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). The next `char` will be the next character in this updated `password`.

State: **`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the next character in `password`**
