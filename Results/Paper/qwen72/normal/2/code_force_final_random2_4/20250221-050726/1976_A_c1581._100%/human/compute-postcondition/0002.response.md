The only object in the loop head is the variable `char` and the iterable `password`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password`. If the `password` has at least one character, the loop will execute. Since the `password` is described as a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), it already ensures that the loop can execute if the password is not empty.

Given that the `password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and `digits` and `letters` are initially empty lists, the state needs to ensure that the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, the `password` must have at least one character, and `char` should be the first character of the `password`.

State: **`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` is an empty list, `letters` is an empty list, `char` is the first character of the `password`**
