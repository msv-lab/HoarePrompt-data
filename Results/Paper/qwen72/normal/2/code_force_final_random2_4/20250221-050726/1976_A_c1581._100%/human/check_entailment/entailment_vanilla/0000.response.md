### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It sorts both lists to ensure that the digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the sorted digits are in non-decreasing order by iterating through the `digits` list and comparing adjacent elements.
   - It also checks if any digit appears after a letter by comparing the last digit with the first letter in the `letters` list.
   - It combines the sorted digits and letters back into a single string and compares it with the original password to ensure the password meets all the conditions.

3. **Conditions Verification:**
   - **Digits Sorted:** The program ensures that all digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - **Letters Sorted:** The program ensures that all letters are in non-decreasing order.
   - **No Digit After Letter:** The program ensures that no digit appears after a letter by checking the relative positions of the last digit and the first letter.
   - **Password Structure:** The program ensures that the password, when sorted, matches the original password, which confirms that the password meets all the conditions.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as passwords with only digits or only letters correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
