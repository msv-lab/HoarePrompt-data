Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each case by reading the length of the password and the password itself. This part is handled well.

2. **Character Separation**: Inside `func_1`, the program separates the characters of the password into two lists: one for digits and one for letters. This is done correctly using the `isdigit()` method.

3. **Sorting and Validation**:
   - The digits and letters are sorted separately.
   - The program then checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order. If any digit is greater than the next one, it returns `False`.
   - It also checks if any digit is greater than any letter. This is a crucial check to ensure no digit comes after a letter.

4. **Final Check**:
   - The program combines the sorted digits and letters back into a string.
   - It compares this sorted string with the original password to see if they match. If they do, it means the password was already in the required format, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as passwords with only digits or only letters correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the password is empty (though the problem guarantees at least one character).

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to validate the passwords according to the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
