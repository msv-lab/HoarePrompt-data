The value of `char` is appended to the list `digits`. Since `char` is the next character in `password`, which is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` now includes this character. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the next character in `password`, `digits` is a list containing `char`.**
