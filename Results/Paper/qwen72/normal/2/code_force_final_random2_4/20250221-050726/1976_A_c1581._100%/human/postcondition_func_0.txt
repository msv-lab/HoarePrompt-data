The function `func_1` takes a string `password` as input, which is expected to be between 1 and 20 characters long, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It separates the digits and letters from the password into two lists, sorts these lists, and then checks if the sorted combination of these lists matches the original password. The function returns `True` if the sorted combination of digits and letters is identical to the original password, indicating that the password is already in a non-decreasing order of digits followed by letters. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
