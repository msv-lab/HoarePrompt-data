The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `digits`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to the length of `digits`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 0.
- Either `i` is equal to or greater than `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is less than or equal to `digits[i + 1]`.
- Additionally, either `i` is greater than or equal to `len(letters)` or `digits[-1]` is less than or equal to `letters[i]`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The condition `i < len(digits)` must still hold true.

Given that `i` was 0 at the end of the last iteration, incrementing `i` by 1 makes `i` equal to 1. For the loop to continue executing, `len(digits)` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` is a non-empty list, `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appeared before sorting, `i` is 1, and `len(digits)` must be greater than 1. Additionally, either `i` is greater than or equal to `len(letters)` or `digits[-1]` is less than or equal to `letters[i]`.**
