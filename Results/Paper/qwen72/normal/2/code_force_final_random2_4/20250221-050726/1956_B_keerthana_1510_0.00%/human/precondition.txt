t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of cards each player receives. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the numbers on the cards in your hand, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice in the sequence. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
