Reasoning:  
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against Nene, who also plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The solution, however, simply counts the occurrences of each card value in your hand and divides by 3, which does not account for the strategic aspect of the game or the interaction between your moves and Nene's moves.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the following:
- You should try to play cards that do not give Nene points.
- Nene will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
- The strategy involves understanding when to play duplicate cards to avoid giving points to Nene.

The current solution does not implement any of these strategic considerations. Instead, it uses a simple count and division, which is not relevant to the game's rules and objectives.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
