Reasoning:  
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score in a card game against an opponent who plays optimally. However, the solution simply counts the occurrences of each card value in your hand and divides by 3, which does not align with the game rules or the objective of maximizing your score while considering Nene's optimal play.

The correct approach should involve:
1. Analyzing the distribution of card values in your hand.
2. Considering the optimal strategy for both you and Nene, where Nene will always try to maximize her score and minimize yours.
3. Calculating the maximum points you can achieve under these conditions.

The current implementation does not consider the interaction between you and Nene, nor does it account for the turn-based nature of the game. Therefore, it does not provide the correct solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
