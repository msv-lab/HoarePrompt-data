To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object `a` since it is the only object in the loop head (`for num in a:`). The loop will execute if `a` is a non-empty iterable. Given the initial state, `a` is derived from `case['array']`, and `case` is the second test case in the `test_cases` list.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the relevant state**: The relevant state is `a`, which is derived from `case['array']`.
2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute if `a` is a non-empty list.
3. **Adjust the state**: Since `a` is derived from `case['array']`, and `case` is the second test case in the `test_cases` list, we need to ensure that `case['array']` is a non-empty list.

### Adjusted State:
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases.
- `case` is the second test case in the list.
- `results` is a list containing one element which is `beautiful_count`.
- `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`.
- `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`.
- `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`.
- `a` is now equal to `case['array']`, which must be a non-empty list.
- `beautiful_count` is 0.

### Final State:
State: **`freq` is an empty dictionary, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing one element which is `beautiful_count`, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a non-empty list, `beautiful_count` is 0**
