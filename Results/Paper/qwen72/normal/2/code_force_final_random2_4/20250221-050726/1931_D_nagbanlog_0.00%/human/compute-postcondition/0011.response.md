Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `num` is the first element of `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The specific values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` depend on the first element of `a` and the values of `x` and `y`, which are derived from the first test case in `test_cases`.
