The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. 

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case consists of:
  - A tuple `(n, x, y)` containing three integers:
    - `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) is the size of the array.
    - `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) and `y` (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9) are Polycarp's favorite integers.
  - A list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array.

The function returns a list `results` which contains `t` elements. Each element in `results` is the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case. The `beautiful_count` represents the total count of numbers in the array `a` that can be paired with another number in `a` such that their sum is divisible by `x` and has a remainder of `mod_y` when divided by `y`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases. Each test case includes a tuple `(n, x, y)` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is the count of pairs in the corresponding array `a` whose sum is divisible by `x` and has a remainder of `mod_y` when divided by `y`.**
