Output State: **`freq` is updated to include the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` with its value incremented by 1, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing one element which is `beautiful_count`, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a non-empty list, `mod_x` is the remainder of the new `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of the new `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged unless explicitly updated by the condition mentioned in the initial state.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `required_mod_x` to `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- All other variables (`freq`, `t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_y`, `beautiful_count`) remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` are derived from the new `num` and the given `x` and `y`.
- The value of `required_mod_x` is now calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- The value of `required_mod_y` remains `mod_y`.
