To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least one test case.
   - `case` is the first test case in the `test_cases` list.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `n` is the first element of `case['params']`.
   - `x` is the second element of `case['params']`.
   - `y` is the third element of `case['params']`.
   - `a` is a list with `n` elements.
   - `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered during the loop, where `mod_x` is the remainder when each element of `a` is divided by `x`, and `mod_y` is the remainder when each element of `a` is divided by `y`.
   - `beautiful_count` is the total count of numbers in `a` that can be transformed into a "beautiful" number by adding a non-negative integer less than `x` such that the resulting number is divisible by both `x` and `y`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `x` and `y` are integers used to determine the remainders of elements in `a`.
   - `freq` is a dictionary that keeps track of how often each pair of remainders `(mod_x, mod_y)` appears in the list `a`.
   - `beautiful_count` is the count of numbers in `a` that can be transformed into a "beautiful" number.

3. **Determine the Value of `beautiful_count`:**
   - The value of `beautiful_count` is determined by the logic of the loop that processes the list `a` and updates the `freq` dictionary.
   - A number in `a` is considered "beautiful" if it can be transformed into a number that is divisible by both `x` and `y` by adding a non-negative integer less than `x`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output a formatted string that includes the value of `beautiful_count`.

Given the initial state and the description of the variables, the output will be:

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count] (where beautiful_count is the total count of numbers in a that can be transformed into a "beautiful" number by adding a non-negative integer less than x such that the resulting number is divisible by both x and y)**
