The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in `a`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the first element of `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still be a non-empty list, and `num` should now be the next element in `a`.

State: **`freq` is updated such that the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1. `beautiful_count` is either 0 or the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is a key in `freq`. `results` remains unchanged, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values of `case['params']`, `case` is now the next element in `test_cases`, `a` is a non-empty list, `num` is the second element of `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, and `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` was not initially in `freq`, it is now a key with a value of `1`.**
