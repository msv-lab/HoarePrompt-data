Postcondition: ***`freq` is an empty dictionary, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing one element which is `beautiful_count`, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a non-empty list, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, then `freq` is updated to include the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` with the value `0`, and `beautiful_count` remains 0. Otherwise, if `(mod_x, mod_y)` is already in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is updated to `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]`.***
