Output State: **`required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, all other variables remain unchanged.** 

This means that the value of `required_mod_x` remains as `(x - mod_x) % x`, and `required_mod_y` is now set to the value of `mod_y`. All other variables are not affected by this code snippet.
