Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list with `n` elements, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered during the loop, where `mod_x` is the remainder when each element of `a` is divided by `x`, and `mod_y` is the remainder when each element of `a` is divided by `y`. `beautiful_count` is the total count of numbers in `a` that can be transformed into a "beautiful" number by adding a non-negative integer less than `x` such that the resulting number is divisible by both `x` and `y`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The list `a` has been fully processed.
- The dictionary `freq` contains the frequency of each unique pair of remainders `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered in the list `a`.
- The variable `beautiful_count` holds the total number of elements in `a` that can be transformed into a "beautiful" number by adding a non-negative integer less than `x` such that the resulting number is divisible by both `x` and `y`.
