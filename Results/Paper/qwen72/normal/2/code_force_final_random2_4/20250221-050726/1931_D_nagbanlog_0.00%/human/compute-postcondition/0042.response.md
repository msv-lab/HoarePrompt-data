The code snippet `freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1` increments the count of the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the dictionary `freq` by 1. This means that the frequency of the pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` is updated to reflect one more occurrence.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case
- `case` is the first test case in the list
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`
- `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`
- `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`
- `a` is a list that must have at least 3 elements
- `num` is the third element of `a`
- `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`
- `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`
- `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`
- If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 0
- If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged

After executing the code snippet:
- The value of `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1, if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.**
