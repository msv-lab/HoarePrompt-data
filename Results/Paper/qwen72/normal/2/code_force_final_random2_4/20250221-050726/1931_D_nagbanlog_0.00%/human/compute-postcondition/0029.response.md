Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 0, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The line `freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0` sets the value of `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` to 0.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
