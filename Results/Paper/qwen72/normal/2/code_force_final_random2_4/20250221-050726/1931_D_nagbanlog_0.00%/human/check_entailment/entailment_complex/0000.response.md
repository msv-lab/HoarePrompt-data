Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting beautiful pairs as defined in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of dictionaries, each containing the parameters and array for a test case).
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, and `y` from the `params` key and the array `a` from the `array` key.

2. **Frequency Dictionary**:
   - A dictionary `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` where `mod_x` is the remainder of `num % x` and `mod_y` is the remainder of `num % y`.

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `a`, it calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
   - It then calculates `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` to find the required pair that would form a beautiful pair with `num`.
   - If the required pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the frequency dictionary, it adds the count of such pairs to `beautiful_count`.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all numbers in the array, the `beautiful_count` for the current test case is appended to the `results` list.
   - Finally, the function returns the `results` list containing the counts of beautiful pairs for each test case.

The logic ensures that all pairs are considered, and the conditions for a pair to be beautiful are correctly checked. The use of the frequency dictionary optimizes the process by avoiding nested loops, making the solution efficient.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct.
