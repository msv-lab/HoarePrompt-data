Based on the initial state provided:

- `freq` is an empty dictionary `{}`.
- `beautiful_count` is 0.
- `results` remains unchanged.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values of `case['params']`.
- `case` is now the next element in `test_cases`.
- `a` is updated to the value of `case['array']`.
- `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` after they are updated from `case['params']` and `case['array']`.

Since the exact content of `case` is not provided, we can only describe the values in terms of the structure of `case`:

- `n` will be the value of `case['params'][0]`.
- `x` will be the value of `case['params'][1]`.
- `y` will be the value of `case['params'][2]`.
- `a` will be the value of `case['array']`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [value of case['params'][0]], x = [value of case['params'][1]], y = [value of case['params'][2]], array = [value of case['array']]**
