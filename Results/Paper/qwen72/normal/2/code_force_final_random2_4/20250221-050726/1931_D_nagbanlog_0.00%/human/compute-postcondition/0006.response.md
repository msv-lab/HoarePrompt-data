Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least one test case.
- `case` is the first test case in the `test_cases` list.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is the first element of the `case['params']` list.
- `x` is the second element of the `case['params']` list.
- `y` is the third element of the `case['params']` list.
- `a` is the list stored in `case['array']`.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.
- `beautiful_count` is 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
```

### Explanation:
- `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, so it will be the value of `case['params'][0]`.
- `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, so it will be the value of `case['params'][1]`.
- `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, so it will be the value of `case['params'][2]`.
- `a` is the list stored in `case['array']`.

### Output:
Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a] (where [n] is the value of `case['params'][0]`, [x] is the value of `case['params'][1]`, [y] is the value of `case['params'][2]`, and [a] is the list stored in `case['array']`)**
