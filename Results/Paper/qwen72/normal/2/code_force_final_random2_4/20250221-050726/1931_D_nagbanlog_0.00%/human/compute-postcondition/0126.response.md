Output State: **`mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`; `mod_y` is the new remainder of `num` divided by `y`; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1; `beautiful_count` is either 0 or the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` plus the previous value of `beautiful_count` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged; `results` remains unchanged; `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values of `case['params']`; `case` is now the next element in `test_cases`; `a` is a non-empty list; `num` is the third element of `a`; `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`; `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**

Explanation:
- The code `beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` updates the value of `beautiful_count` by adding the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` to it.
- If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is increased by the corresponding value in `freq`.
- If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is not in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.
- All other variables and their states remain as described in the initial state.
