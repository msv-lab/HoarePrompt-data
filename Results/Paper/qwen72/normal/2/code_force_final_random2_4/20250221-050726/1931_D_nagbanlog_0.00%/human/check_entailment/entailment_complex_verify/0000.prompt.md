You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case. The `freq` dictionary for each test case will contain the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered in the array `a` of that test case. The `beautiful_count` for each test case represents the total count of numbers in `a` that can be paired with another number in `a` such that their sum is divisible by `x` and has a remainder of `mod_y` when divided by `y`. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`) remain unchanged as they were before the loop started.

    #The program returns the list `results` which contains `t` elements, where each element is the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case. Each `beautiful_count` represents the total count of numbers in the array `a` that can be paired with another number in `a` such that their sum is divisible by `x` and has a remainder of `mod_y` when divided by `y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases, where each test case is a dictionary containing a tuple `(n, x, y)` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case to count the number of pairs in the array `a` such that the sum of each pair is divisible by `x` and has a remainder of `mod_y` when divided by `y`. The function returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is the count of such pairs for the corresponding test case. All input variables remain unchanged after the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it calculates the required modulo values for the second condition (a_i - a_j is divisible by y). Specifically, the code assumes that `required_mod_y` should always be equal to `mod_y`, which is incorrect. The correct approach should consider both positive and negative differences to ensure that the subtraction condition is met.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Condition for Addition (a_i + a_j is divisible by x):**
   - The code correctly calculates `mod_x` and `required_mod_x` to check if the sum is divisible by `x`.

2. **Condition for Subtraction (a_i - a_j is divisible by y):**
   - The code incorrectly assumes that `required_mod_y` should always be `mod_y`. This is not correct because the difference `a_i - a_j` can be either positive or negative, and we need to account for both cases.

To fix this, the code should consider both possible values for `required_mod_y`:
- `required_mod_y = (mod_y + y) % y` (for positive difference)
- `required_mod_y = (mod_y - y) % y` (for negative difference)

However, the current implementation only checks one of these cases, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the following test case:
- `n = 4`, `x = 3`, `y = 2`, `a = [1, 2, 4, 5]`

Expected Output:
- The pairs (1, 4) and (2, 5) are beautiful:
  - For (1, 4): \(1 + 4 = 5\) (not divisible by 3), \(1 - 4 = -3\) (divisible by 2)
  - For (2, 5): \(2 + 5 = 7\) (not divisible by 3), \(2 - 5 = -3\) (divisible by 2)

The program will incorrectly count these pairs because it does not handle the subtraction condition correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in handling the subtraction condition.
