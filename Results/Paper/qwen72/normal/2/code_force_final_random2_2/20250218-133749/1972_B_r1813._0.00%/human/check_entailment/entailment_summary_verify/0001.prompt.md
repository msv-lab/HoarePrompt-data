You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads from standard input a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" characters. It processes each test case to determine if the number of "U" characters in the string is odd, appending 'YES' to the results list if true, and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the results list to the standard output. The final state of the program includes a list of results corresponding to each test case, which has been printed out.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list called `data`.
   - It initializes an index to keep track of the current position in the `data` list.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the first element of `data`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - It counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.

3. **Determining the Winner**:
   - The program checks if the number of facing-up coins (`num_up_coins`) is odd or even.
   - If `num_up_coins` is odd, Alice wins (since she goes first and can always make a move when there's an odd number of facing-up coins).
   - If `num_up_coins` is even, Bob wins (since Alice will eventually be forced to make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins, and Bob can always respond optimally).

4. **Output**:
   - The program appends the result ('YES' or 'NO') to a list called `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Logic**:
  - The logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins is correct. This is because the game is symmetric and the player who starts with an odd number of facing-up coins can always force a win.
  - The program correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem statement.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where there are no facing-up coins (the player whose turn it is loses).
  - It also handles the case where there are only one or two coins left, as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all the specified cases correctly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
