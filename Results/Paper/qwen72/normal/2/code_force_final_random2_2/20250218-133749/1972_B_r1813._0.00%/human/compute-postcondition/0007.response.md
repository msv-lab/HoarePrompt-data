The value of `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`. Since `index` is 1, `n` is set to the integer value of `data[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `index` is 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `data[0]` must be a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
