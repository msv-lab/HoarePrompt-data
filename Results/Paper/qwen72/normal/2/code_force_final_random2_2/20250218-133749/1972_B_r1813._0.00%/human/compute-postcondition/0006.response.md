To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Given the initial state, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`. For the loop to execute, `data[0]` must be a positive integer.

Here's the adjusted state:
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace.
- `index` is 1 (unchanged as it is not part of the loop head).
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, and `data[0]` must be a positive integer.
- `results` is an empty list (unchanged as it is not part of the loop head).

State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `index` is 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and `data[0]` must be a positive integer, `results` is an empty list**
