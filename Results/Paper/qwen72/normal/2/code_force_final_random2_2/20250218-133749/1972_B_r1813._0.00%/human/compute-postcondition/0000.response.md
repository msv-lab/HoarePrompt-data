Output State: **The function definition remains unchanged, and no new variables or changes to existing variables occur due to the `input = sys.stdin.read` line. The function `func_1(t, test_cases)` is defined with `t` as an integer representing the number of test cases and `test_cases` as a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D" characters.**
