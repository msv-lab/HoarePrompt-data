### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It initializes an index to keep track of the current position in the list.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the first element of the list.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - The key observation is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`).
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always have a move available when it's her turn, and she can force Bob into a losing position.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice will eventually run out of moves and lose.

3. **Output:**
   - The function appends "YES" to the results list if the number of facing-up coins is odd, indicating that Alice will win.
   - Otherwise, it appends "NO" to the results list, indicating that Bob will win.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the results list.

### Correctness:
- The logic correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
- The input parsing and output formatting are correct and match the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
