Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually accept parameters to represent the input described in the problem. A corrected function definition would be: `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D" characters.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `index` is `2 * t + 1`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be a positive integer, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on whether the count of 'U' characters in the corresponding string `s` was odd or even.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `index` is `2 * t + 1`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be a positive integer, `results` is a list containing the final number of elements (either 'YES' or 'NO') equal to the number of strings in `data` after all iterations of the loop have completed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads from standard input a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" characters. It processes each test case to determine if the number of "U" characters in the string is odd, appending 'YES' to the results list if true, and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the results list to the standard output. The final state of the program includes a list of results corresponding to each test case, which has been printed out.
