Reasoning:  
The provided solution reads the input correctly and processes each test case as described. The core logic of the solution is based on counting the number of "U" (facing-up) coins in each test case and determining the winner based on whether this count is odd or even. According to the game rules, if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will have the last move and thus win the game. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will have the last move and win the game.

The logic implemented in the program aligns with this reasoning:
- It counts the number of "U" coins using `s.count('U')`.
- It checks if this count is odd (`num_up_coins % 2 == 1`), and appends 'YES' to the results list if true, indicating Alice wins.
- Otherwise, it appends 'NO', indicating Bob wins.

This approach is correct because the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of facing-up coins determines the outcome of the game when both players play optimally. The program correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the results as required.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
