Output State: **`mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was '>', `mak2` is 0, `pans` contains all values of `i` for which the user input was either "<" or "=", and `i` is `len(pans) - 1`. If no '>' inputs were received, `mak` will be 0. The `sys.stdout.flush()` call ensures that any buffered output is written to the terminal immediately, but does not change any variable values.**
