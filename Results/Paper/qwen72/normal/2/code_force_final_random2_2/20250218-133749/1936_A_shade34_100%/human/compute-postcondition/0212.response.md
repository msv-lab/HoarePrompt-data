Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `pans` must have at least 3 elements.
   - `s` is the last user input string.
   - If the user input is '>', `mak` is 2. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 or 1 depending on the previous user input.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `mak` depends on the user input:
     - If the user input `s` is '>', then `mak` is 2.
     - Otherwise, `mak` is either 0 or 1 (depending on the previous user input).

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will start with the string `'?'`.
   - It will then print `pans[mak]` twice.
   - It will then print `pans[i]` twice, where `i` is 3.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If the user input `s` is '>', then `mak` is 2, and the output will be:
     ```
     ?, pans[2], pans[2], pans[3], pans[3]
     ```
   - If the user input `s` is not '>', then `mak` is either 0 or 1, and the output will be:
     ```
     ?, pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[3], pans[3]
     ```
     where `mak` is 0 or 1 depending on the previous user input.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:

Output: **?, pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[3], pans[3] (where mak is 2 if the user input is '>', otherwise mak is 0 or 1 depending on the previous user input)**
