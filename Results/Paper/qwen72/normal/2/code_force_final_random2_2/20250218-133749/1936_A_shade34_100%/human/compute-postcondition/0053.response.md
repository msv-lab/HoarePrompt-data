The code snippet sets `mak` to 0. This overrides any previous value that `mak` might have had. The other variables (`i`, `mak2`, `pans`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` will contain all values of `i` for which the user input was either "<" or "=". If no such inputs were received, `pans` will remain an empty list.**
