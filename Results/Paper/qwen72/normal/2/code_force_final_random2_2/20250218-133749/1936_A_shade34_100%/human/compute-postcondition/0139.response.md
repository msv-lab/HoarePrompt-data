Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mak` is either 0 or `n-1`.
   - `mak2` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution.
   - `pans` is a list containing at least `n+1` elements.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - The last user input string `s` is either ">" or the previous value.
     - If the last user input is ">", `mak` is set to `n-1`.
     - Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `mak` is either 0 or `n-1` based on the last user input.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `pans` is a list with at least `n+1` elements, so `pans[i]` is `pans[n+1]`.

4. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: Last user input is ">":**
     - `mak` is set to `n-1`.
     - The print statement will be:
       ```python
       print('?', pans[n-1], pans[n-1], pans[n+1], pans[n+1])
       ```
     - Output: **? [pans[n-1]] [pans[n-1]] [pans[n+1]] [pans[n+1]] (where pans[n-1] is the element at index n-1 of the list pans and pans[n+1] is the element at index n+1 of the list pans)**

   - **Case 2: Last user input is not ">":**
     - `mak` remains 0.
     - The print statement will be:
       ```python
       print('?', pans[0], pans[0], pans[n+1], pans[n+1])
       ```
     - Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[n+1]] [pans[n+1]] (where pans[0] is the element at index 0 of the list pans and pans[n+1] is the element at index n+1 of the list pans)**

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact value of the last user input is not specified, we need to cover both cases.
   - If the last user input is ">", the output will be:
     - Output: **? [pans[n-1]] [pans[n-1]] [pans[n+1]] [pans[n+1]] (where pans[n-1] is the element at index n-1 of the list pans and pans[n+1] is the element at index n+1 of the list pans)**
   - If the last user input is not ">", the output will be:
     - Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[n+1]] [pans[n+1]] (where pans[0] is the element at index 0 of the list pans and pans[n+1] is the element at index n+1 of the list pans)**

Given the task, the most precise and general answer is:

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[n+1]] [pans[n+1]] (where mak is 0 if the last user input is not ">", and n-1 if the last user input is ">", and pans[n+1] is the element at index n+1 of the list pans)**
