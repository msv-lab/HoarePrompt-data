Output State: **`mak` is 0 or `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution, `pans` is a list containing at least `n+1` elements, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is the input integer, and the last user input string `s` is either ">" or the previous value. If the last user input is ">", `mak` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
