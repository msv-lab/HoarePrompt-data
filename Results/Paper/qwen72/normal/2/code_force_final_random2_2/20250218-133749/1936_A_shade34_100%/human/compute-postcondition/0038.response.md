Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak` is 1, `mak2` is 0, `s` is a string input by the user, and `pans` remains an empty list if `s` is neither `<` nor `=`. If `s` is `<` or `=`, `pans` is `[0]`.**

Explanation: The value of `mak` is updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
