Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `mak`: This is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was ">". This means `mak` is the position in the list `pans` where the user last entered ">".
- `mak2`: This is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution. This means `mak2` is the highest index where the user input was "<".
- `pans`: This is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was "=" or the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<". Essentially, `pans` contains indices where the user input was either "=" or the largest "<".
- `i`: This is `len(pans) - 1`, meaning it is the index of the last element in the `pans` list.
- `n`: This is the input integer, but it is not directly used in the print statement.
- `s`: The last user input string is either ">" or the previous value. This is not directly relevant to the print statement.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`mak2`**: This is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<". It represents the highest index in the `pans` list where the user input was "<".
2. **`pans[mak]`**: This is the element in the `pans` list at the index `mak`. Since `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was ">", `pans[mak]` will be the value of `i` at that specific index.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the string "!", followed by the value of `mak2`, and then the value of `pans[mak]`.

Output: **! [mak2] [pans[mak]] (where mak2 is the largest value of i for which the user input was "<" and pans[mak] is the value of i for the last element in pans for which the user input was ">")**
