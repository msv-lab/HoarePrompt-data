Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is the input string. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is equal to the value of `i`, and `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` now includes the value of `i`. Otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `mak`. Since `i` was previously defined as `i + 1`, `mak` now holds the value of `i + 1`. The conditions related to `s` and `pans` remain unchanged, and `n` is still greater than 0. Therefore, the updated state reflects the new value of `mak` while maintaining the other conditions as they were in the initial state.
