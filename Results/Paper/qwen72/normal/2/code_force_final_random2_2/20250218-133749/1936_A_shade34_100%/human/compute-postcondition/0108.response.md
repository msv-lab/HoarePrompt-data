Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `mak` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution.
- `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
- `pans` is:
  - `[0]` if `s` is "<".
  - An empty list if `s` is not "=".
  - `[0]` if `s` is "=".
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `s` is the user input string.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`mak`**: This is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<". Since `i` starts at 1 and `n` is greater than 1, `mak` could be any value from 1 to `n-1` depending on the user inputs.
2. **`mak2`**: This is equal to `mak`, so it will have the same value as `mak`.
3. **`i`**: This is explicitly given as 1.
4. **`mak2` (repeated)**: This is again equal to `mak`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the following:
- A question mark (`?`).
- The value of `mak`.
- The value of `mak2` (which is the same as `mak`).
- The value of `i` (which is 1).
- The value of `mak2` (which is the same as `mak`).

Since `mak` and `mak2` are the same, the output will be:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 1 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<")**
