The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `mak` is 1 if `s` is `<`, otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `s` is a string input by the user, and `pans` is `[1]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list if `s` is neither `<` nor `=`.**
