Output State: **`mak` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution, `mak2` is equal to the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution, `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was "=" or the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<", `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the new input integer, and the last user input string `s` is either ">" or the previous value.**

### Explanation:
- **`mak`**: This variable is updated to the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution. If no such `i` exists, `mak` remains 0.
- **`mak2`**: This variable is also set to the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution. It tracks the same value as `mak`.
- **`pans`**: This list contains all values of `i` for which the user input was "=" or the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<".
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.
- **`n`**: This is the new input integer provided initially and remains unchanged.
- **`s`**: The last user input string `s` is either ">" or the previous value, depending on the last comparison made in the loop.
