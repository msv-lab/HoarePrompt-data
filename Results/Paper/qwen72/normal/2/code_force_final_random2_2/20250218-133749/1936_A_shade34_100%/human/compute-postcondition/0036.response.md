The `sys.stdout.flush()` command flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all data written to `stdout` is immediately written to the terminal or output device. This operation does not change the values of any variables or alter the program's state in terms of variable values.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, and `s` is a string input by the user. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is `[0]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0]`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.**
