Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0 (though `n` is not used in the print statement)
- `mak` is 0
- `mak2` is 0
- `pans` is an empty list

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Let's break down what will be printed:

- `'?'` is a string literal and will be printed as is.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `mak2` is 0 (repeated).

So, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 0 0**
