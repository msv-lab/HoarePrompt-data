Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `mak` is 0.
2. `mak2` is equal to the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution.
3. `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was "=" or the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<".
4. `i` is `len(pans) - 1`.
5. `n` must be greater than 1.
6. The last user input string `s` is either ">" or the previous value.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- `mak` is explicitly given as 0.
- `mak` is printed twice, so both instances will be 0.
- `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, which means it is the index of the last element in the `pans` list.
- `i` is printed twice, so both instances will be the same value.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the following:
- The string `'?'`
- The value of `mak` (which is 0)
- The value of `mak` again (which is 0)
- The value of `i` (which is `len(pans) - 1`)
- The value of `i` again (which is `len(pans) - 1`)

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 [len(pans) - 1] [len(pans) - 1]**
