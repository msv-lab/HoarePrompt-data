The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all output is written immediately. This operation does not alter any of the variables in the current state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`mak` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is [0] if `s` is "<", otherwise `pans` is an empty list if `s` is not "=", or `pans` is a list containing `[0]` if `s` is "=", `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `s` is the user input string.**
