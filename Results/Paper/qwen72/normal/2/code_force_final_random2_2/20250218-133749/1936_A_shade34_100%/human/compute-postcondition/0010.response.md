Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `mak` is 0 unless the user input is a string equal to "<", in which case `mak` is 1.

The print statement is:
```
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Let's break down the values:
- The first value is a string `'?'`.
- The next two values are `mak`, which can either be 0 or 1 depending on the user input.
- The last two values are `i`, which is 2.

Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `mak`:
- If the user input is not "<", then `mak` is 0.
- If the user input is "<", then `mak` is 1.

So, the possible outputs are:
- If `mak` is 0: `? 0 0 2 2`
- If `mak` is 1: `? 1 1 2 2`

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 2 (where [mak] is 0 if the user input is not "<" and 1 if the user input is "<")**
