To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than the current value of `i`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `s` is the input string.
- `mak` and `mak2` remain as described based on the conditions of `s`.

### Variables:
- `i`: This variable is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `s`: This is the input string, but its specific value is not provided.
- `mak`: This variable is described based on the conditions of `s`, but its exact value is not specified.
- `mak2`: This variable is also described based on the conditions of `s`, but its exact value is not specified.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
- The first element in the `print` statement is a literal string `'?'`.
- `mak` and `mak2` are variables whose values depend on the conditions of the input string `s`. Since the exact conditions and values of `mak` and `mak2` are not provided, we can only describe them in general terms.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If the previous value of `i` was `i_prev`, then the new value of `i` is `i_prev + 1`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the following:
- The literal string `'?'`.
- The value of `mak` (which depends on the conditions of `s`).
- The value of `mak2` (which depends on the conditions of `s`).
- The new value of `i` (which is `i_prev + 1`).
- The value of `mak2` again (which depends on the conditions of `s`).

Since the exact values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i` are not provided, we can only describe them in general terms.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] (where [mak] and [mak2] are values based on the conditions of the input string `s`, and [i] is the value of `i` after being incremented by 1)**
