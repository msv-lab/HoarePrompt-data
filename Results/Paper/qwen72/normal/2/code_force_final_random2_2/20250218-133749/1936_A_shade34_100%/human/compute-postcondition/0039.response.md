Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak` is 1, `mak2` is 0, `s` is a string input by the user, `pans` is `[1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pans = [i]` assigns the list containing the value of `i` (which is 1) to `pans`. Therefore, `pans` is now `[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
