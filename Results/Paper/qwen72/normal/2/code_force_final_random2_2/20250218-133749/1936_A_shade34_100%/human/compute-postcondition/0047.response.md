Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `mak` is 2, `mak2` is 0, `s` is a new string input by the user, `pans` is `[1]` if `s` (new input) is `<` or `=`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list if `s` (new input) is neither `<` nor `=`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mak` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 2.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `mak2`, `s`, and `pans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
