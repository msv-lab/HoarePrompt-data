Output State: **`mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was ">", `mak2` is equal to the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution, `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was "=" or the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<", `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `n` is the input integer, and the last user input string `s` is either ">" or the previous value.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` command ensures that any buffered output is written to the terminal immediately, but it does not change the state of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
