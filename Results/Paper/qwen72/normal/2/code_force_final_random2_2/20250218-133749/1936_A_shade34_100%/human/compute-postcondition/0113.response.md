The code `pans.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `pans`. The other variables (`mak`, `mak2`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mak` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is [0, 1] if `s` is "<", otherwise `pans` is [1] if `s` is not "=", or `pans` is [0, 1] if `s` is "=", `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `s` is the new user input string.**
