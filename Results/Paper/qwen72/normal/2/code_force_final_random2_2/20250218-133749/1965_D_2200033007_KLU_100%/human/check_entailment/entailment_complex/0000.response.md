Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires reconstructing a palindromic array from the sums of all but one of its subarrays. The key points are:
   - The array is a palindrome.
   - One subarray sum is missing.
   - The solution must be a valid palindrome.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function generates all possible subarray sums of a given palindromic array and returns them in a sorted list. It correctly computes the cumulative sums and sorts them.
   - **func_2**: This function identifies the unique elements in the list of subarray sums. It effectively removes pairs of identical elements, leaving only those that appear an odd number of times.
   - **func_3**: This function constructs the palindromic array from the unique subarray sums. It correctly handles the placement of elements to ensure the array is a palindrome.
   - **func_4**: This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing two lists and removing matching elements from the end. It correctly identifies the missing sum.

3. **Program Flow**:
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - It reads the input, sorts the subarray sums, and identifies the unique sums using `func_2`.
   - It determines the missing sum and appends it to the list of unique sums.
   - It reconstructs the palindromic array using `func_3` and prints the result.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when the array length is 3 or 4, and when the missing sum is the smallest or largest in the list.
   - The constraints ensure that there is always at least one valid solution, so the program should always produce a valid output.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the missing subarray sum and constructs a valid palindromic array.
   - The functions work together to ensure that the final output meets the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
