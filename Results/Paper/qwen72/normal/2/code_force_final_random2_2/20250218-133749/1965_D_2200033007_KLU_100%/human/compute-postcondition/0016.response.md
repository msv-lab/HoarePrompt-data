Postcondition: ***`odds` is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums and must have at least two elements. `x` is the second element of `odds`, `prev` is now equal to the first element of `odds`, and `idx` is `idx - 1`. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is now equal to the second element of `odds`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` is also set to `(x - prev) // 2`.***
