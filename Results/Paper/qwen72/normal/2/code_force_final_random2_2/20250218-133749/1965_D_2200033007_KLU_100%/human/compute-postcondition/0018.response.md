Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums and must have at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `odds`, `prev` is now equal to the second element of `odds`, `idx` is `idx - 1 - 1` (or `idx - 2`). If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is now equal to the second element of `odds`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` is also set to `(x - prev) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is decremented by 1, so `idx` is now `idx - 2`.
- The values of `odds`, `x`, and `prev` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for updating `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are still the same as described in the initial state.
