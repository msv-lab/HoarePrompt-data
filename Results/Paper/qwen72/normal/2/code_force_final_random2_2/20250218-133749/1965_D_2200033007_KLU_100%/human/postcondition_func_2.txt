The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `odds`, a list of integers representing the sums of subarrays at odd indices, and `n`, an integer representing the length of the original array `a` (where `n` is odd and 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000). It returns a list `a` of length `n`, where each element is either directly set to a value from `odds` or calculated as `(x - prev) // 2`, where `x` is the current value from `odds` and `prev` is the previous value from `odds`. The elements of `a` are populated such that for each `x` in `odds`, if the index `idx` is equal to `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`. Otherwise, both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`. The final state of the program is that `odds` remains unchanged, `prev` is equal to the last element of `odds`, and `idx` is `-1`.
