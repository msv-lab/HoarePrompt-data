Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **func_1**: This function generates all subarray sums for a given array `a` and returns them sorted. This is used to verify the correctness of the solution by comparing the generated subarray sums with the input subarray sums.

2. **func_2**: This function identifies the unique subarray sums that appear an odd number of times in the list of subarray sums. In a palindromic array, most subarray sums will appear an even number of times, except for the middle element (if `n` is odd) and the missing subarray sum.

3. **func_3**: This function reconstructs the palindromic array `a` using the unique subarray sums identified in `func_2`. It places the values in the correct positions to ensure the array is palindromic.

4. **func_4**: This function is not directly used in the main logic but seems to be a utility function to find the first differing element between two lists, which could be useful for debugging or verification purposes.

The overall approach is sound and aligns with the problem requirements. The functions work together to identify the missing subarray sum and reconstruct the palindromic array, ensuring that the output is a valid solution.
