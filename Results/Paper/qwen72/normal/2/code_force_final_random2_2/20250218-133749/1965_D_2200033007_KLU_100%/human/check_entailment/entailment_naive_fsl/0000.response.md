Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program seems to correctly address the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how each function contributes to solving the problem:

1. **func_1**: This function generates all subarray sums of a given array `a` and returns them sorted. It correctly computes the cumulative sums for each subarray and appends them to the list `cts`.

2. **func_2**: This function identifies the unique subarray sums that appear an odd number of times. It uses a stack-like approach to cancel out pairs of identical sums, leaving only those that appear an odd number of times. This is crucial because the missing subarray sum will be the one that appears an odd number of times.

3. **func_3**: This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of unique subarray sums (`odds`). It correctly places the values in the middle of the array and ensures that the array remains a palindrome. The logic of dividing the difference by 2 and placing it symmetrically around the center is sound.

4. **func_4**: This function is not directly used in the main logic of the problem, but it seems to be a utility function to find the last element in `bigList` that is not in `smallList`. However, it is not called in the provided context, so it does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the functions, the program appears to handle all edge cases and potential inputs correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
