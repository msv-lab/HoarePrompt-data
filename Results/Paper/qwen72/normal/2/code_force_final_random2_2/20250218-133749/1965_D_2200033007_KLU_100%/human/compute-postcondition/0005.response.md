The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from `smallList`. Since the initial state indicates that the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` were equal before the last element of `bigList` was removed, removing the last element from `smallList` means that the last elements of both lists are no longer equal (as the last element of `bigList` remains unchanged).

Output State: **`bigList` is now a list of integers with its last two elements removed, `smallList` is now a list with its last two elements removed, and every element in `smallList` is still in `bigList`. Both lists are non-empty, and the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` were equal before the last two elements of `bigList` were removed.**
