You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of positive integers representing a palindrome array.
def func_1(a):
    cts = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        sm = 0
        
        for j in range(i, len(a)):
            sm = sm + a[j]
            cts.append(sm)
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `a` remains a list of positive integers representing a palindrome array. `cts` is a list containing all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from each index `i` to the end of the array `a`. The variable `i` is equal to the length of `a`, and `sm` is the sum of the subarray from the last element to the last element (which is just the last element itself).
    cts.sort()
    return cts
    #The program returns `cts`, which is a sorted list containing all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from each index `i` to the end of the palindrome array `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `a` of positive integers representing a palindrome array and returns a sorted list of all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from each index to the end of the array.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `cts`, which is a sorted list containing all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from each index `i` to the end of the palindrome array `a`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
