Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums and must have at least three elements, `x` is the third element of `odds`, `prev` is the third element of `odds`, `idx` is `idx - 1`. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to the third element of `odds`. Otherwise, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is decremented by 1.
- The values of `odds`, `x`, and `prev` remain unchanged.
- The condition `if idx == n - 1 - idx` and the subsequent assignment to `a[idx]` or `a[n - 1 - idx]` are not affected by the decrement of `idx` in this snippet, so they remain as described in the initial state.
