The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the next line read from standard input, which is stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. The other variables (`t`, `cases`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 98, `cases` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is `(n, s)` and the second tuple is also `(n, s)`, `n` is the integer value of the next line read from standard input, `s` is the stripped input string.**
