To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

- The variable `i` is initialized by the `range(n - 1)` function, starting from 0.
- For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, meaning `n` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 (which already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute).
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n (this does not affect the loop execution directly).
- `tree` is an empty deque (this does not affect the loop execution directly).
- `empty` is True (this does not affect the loop execution directly).

Since `n` is already specified to be at least 2, the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the given conditions.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `tree` is an empty deque, `empty` is True, `i` is 0**
