The code snippet `u, v = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`.

- `u` and `v` are now assigned the values read from the input.
- The other variables (`n`, `t`, `tree`, `empty`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `tree` is an empty deque, `empty` is True, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are input integers.**
