Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `i` is `n - 1`, `u` and `v` are the last input integers, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque containing the nodes of the tree in a specific order where the first and last elements are the two leaves of the tree, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing `[min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]`, and all elements in `moves` are even.**
