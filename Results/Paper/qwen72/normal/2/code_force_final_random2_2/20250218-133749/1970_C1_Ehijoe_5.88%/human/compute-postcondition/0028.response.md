The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, or `i`, nor does it change the state of `empty` or the contents of `tree`. However, the new values of `u` and `v` will be used in subsequent logic based on the conditions described in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are input integers, `empty` is True or False (unchanged), and `tree` is a deque (unchanged).**
