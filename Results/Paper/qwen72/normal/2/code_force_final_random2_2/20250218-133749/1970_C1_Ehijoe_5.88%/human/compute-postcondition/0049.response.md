Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are the input integers, `empty` is True or False (unchanged), and `tree` is a deque containing `v`.** 

The value `v` has been appended to the deque `tree`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
