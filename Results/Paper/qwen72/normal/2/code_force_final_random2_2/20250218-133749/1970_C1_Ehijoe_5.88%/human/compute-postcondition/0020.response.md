Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `tree` is an empty deque, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are input integers, and `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`. Additionally, `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`. Furthermore, `u` is not equal to the first element of `tree`. The current value of `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`.**
