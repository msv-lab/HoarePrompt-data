Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `tree` is a deque containing the integer `u`, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are input integers, `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, and the current value of `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the integer `u` to the deque `tree`. Since `tree` was initially empty, after appending `u`, `tree` now contains only the integer `u`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
