Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are the input integers, `empty` is False, and `tree` is a deque containing `u` and `v`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet sets `empty` to `False`. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `i`, `u`, `v`, and `tree`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
