Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2, `sunks` is increased by 1.** 

Explanation: The value of `sunks` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged. The conditions for `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` specified in the initial state are still valid.
