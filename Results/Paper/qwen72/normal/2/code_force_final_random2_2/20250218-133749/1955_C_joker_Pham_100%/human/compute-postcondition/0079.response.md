Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2. If `k` is 0, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the conditions for modifying `a[r]` and updating `sunks` remain as specified in the precondition.***
