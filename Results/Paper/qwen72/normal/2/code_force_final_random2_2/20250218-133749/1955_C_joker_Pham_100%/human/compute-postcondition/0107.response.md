The code snippet `sunks += 1` increments the value of `sunks` by 1. This operation does not affect the values of `a`, `n`, `k`, `l`, or `r`. However, it changes the value of `sunks`.

Given the initial state:
- `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`
- `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k - 2 * a[l] ≤ 10^15
- `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `l` is either 0 or 1
- `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2
- `sunks` remains unchanged if `l` equals `r`
- If `a[r]` is 0, `r` becomes either n - 2 or n - 3, and `sunks` is increased by 1
- Otherwise, `r` remains as n - 1 or n - 2, and `sunks` remains unchanged

After executing the code snippet `sunks += 1`, the value of `sunks` is incremented by 1. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k - 2 * a[l] ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2, `sunks` is increased by 1.**
