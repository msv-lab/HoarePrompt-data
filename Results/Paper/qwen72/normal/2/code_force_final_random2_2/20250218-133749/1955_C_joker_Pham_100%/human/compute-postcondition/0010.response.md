Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, and `l` is equal to `r`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
