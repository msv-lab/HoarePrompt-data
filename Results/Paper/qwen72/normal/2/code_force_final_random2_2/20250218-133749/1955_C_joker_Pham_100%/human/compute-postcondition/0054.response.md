Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, and `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2. If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[r]`, then `r` is now either n - 2 or n - 3, `sunks` is now 1, 2, or 3. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is now 1 or 2, the current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l-1]`, `k` is now `k - 2 * a[r]`, `a[l-1]` is now 0, and `sunks` is now 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, the current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`, `k` is now `k - 2 * a[r]`, and `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`. If `k` is less than `2 * a[r]`, then `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, and `k` is less than `2 * a[r]`. If `a[r] * 2` is equal to `k`, `sunks` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sunks` remains either 0, 1, or 2, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
