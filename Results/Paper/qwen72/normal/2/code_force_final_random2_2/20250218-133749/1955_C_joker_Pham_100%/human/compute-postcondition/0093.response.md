Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2. If `k` is 0, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, `r` is updated to either n - 2 or n - 3 (depending on its initial value), and `sunks` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` is 0 and `k` is not 0, otherwise `sunks` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` is not 0, and `k` and `a[l]` are updated accordingly if `a[l]` is 0. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `a[r] * 2 == k`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `a[r] * 2 != k` and `k` is not 0, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement continues.***
