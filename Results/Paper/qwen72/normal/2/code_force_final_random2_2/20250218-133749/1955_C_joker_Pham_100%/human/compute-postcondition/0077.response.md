Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2. If `a[l] <= a[r]`, and if `k >= a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l-1]`. If `a[r]` becomes 0, `sunks` is increased by 1. If `l` equals `r`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and the loop or if statement is exited. Additionally, `sunks` is increased by 1, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `k < a[l] * 2` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is increased by 1 if `l` equals `r`, and the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, if `l` equals `r`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and the loop or if statement is exited.***
