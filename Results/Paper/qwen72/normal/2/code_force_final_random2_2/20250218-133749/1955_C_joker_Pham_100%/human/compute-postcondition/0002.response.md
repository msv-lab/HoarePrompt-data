To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while l <= r:
```

The loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Given the initial state:

- `l` is 0
- `r` is `n - 1`

For the loop to execute at least once, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. Since `l` is 0, the condition `l <= r` will hold true as long as `r` is non-negative. Given that `r` is `n - 1` and `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `r` will always be non-negative.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is 0**
