Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2. If `k == 0`, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a[l] <= a[r]` and `k >= a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, `k` is reduced by `2 * a[l]`, `l` is set to 1, and `sunks` is increased by 1. If `k < a[l] * 2` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 if `l` does not equal `r`; otherwise, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k < a[l] * 2` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 != k`, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l] > a[r]`, the program continues without changing any variables.***
