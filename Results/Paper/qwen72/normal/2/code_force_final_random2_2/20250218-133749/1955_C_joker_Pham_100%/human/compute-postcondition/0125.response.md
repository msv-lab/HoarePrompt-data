Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either n - 2 or n - 3, `k` is reduced by `2 * a[r]`, `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
