Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` and `r` are indices such that `l` is either 0 or 1, and `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2, and `sunks` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[l]`, then `l` is 1, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is 1, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[0]`, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[0]`. If `a[r]` becomes 0, then `r` is n - 2, `sunks` is 2, and `a[r]` is 0. If `k` is less than `2 * a[l]`, then `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, and if `a[l] * 2 - 1` is equal to `k`, then `sunks` is set to 1; otherwise, `sunks` remains 0. In both cases, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
