Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is 0, the current value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a[r]`, `k` is now `k - 2 * a[l]`, and `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is n - 2, `sunks` is 1, and `a[r]` is 0.***
