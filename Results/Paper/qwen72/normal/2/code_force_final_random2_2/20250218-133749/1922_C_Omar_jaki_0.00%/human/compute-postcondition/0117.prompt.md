Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop has executed all iterations, the list `a` remains a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, and must have at least 4 elements. The variable `t` is the first integer read from the input minus 3, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `n` remains an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The variable `m` remains an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5. The variable `queries` remains a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. The list `b` will contain the accumulated values based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `u` is now the next value generated by `r()`. The variables `c` and `d` remain the last two elements returned by the function `r()` before `u` became 0.
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`u` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`u` is a non-zero value decreased by 2, `c` and `d` are assigned new values returned by `r()`, and the relationship between `c` and `d` is such that if `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`; otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`u` is a non-zero value decreased by 3, `c` and `d` are assigned new values returned by `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`; otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
