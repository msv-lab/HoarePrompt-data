Output State: **`t` is the first integer read from the input minus 2, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and `t` must be greater than 0; `n` remains an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, and must have at least 4 elements; `m` remains an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `queries` remains a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `b` is updated such that the new elements are `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)` and `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`, making the length of `b` now `len(a) - 1`; `u` is 0; `c` and `d` are the final values returned by `r()` during the last iteration of the loop. If `c` < `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`; `w` is `-1000000000.0`, `x` is the first element produced by `r()`, `y` is the second element produced by `r()`, `z` is the third element produced by `r()`, `v` is `y - x`.**
