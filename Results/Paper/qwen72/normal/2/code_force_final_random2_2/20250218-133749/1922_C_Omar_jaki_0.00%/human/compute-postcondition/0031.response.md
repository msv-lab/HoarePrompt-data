To determine what will be printed by the `print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: The first integer read from the input minus 1, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`n`**: An integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
3. **`a`**: A list starting with \(-1000000000.0\), followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with \(2000000000.0\). The list must have at least 4 elements.
4. **`m`**: An integer where \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\).
5. **`queries`**: A list of \(m\) pairs \((x_i, y_i)\) where \(1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq n\) and \(x_i \neq y_i\).
6. **`b`**: A list where the first two elements are \([0, 0]\), and subsequent elements are the cumulative sums of the conditions \((v > x - w)\) and \((v > z - y)\) applied to each triplet \((w, x, y, z)\) in the list `a`. The length of `b` will be `len(a) - 2`.
7. **`u`**: The value returned by `r()` minus 2, and it must evaluate to `True` - 2. This implies `u` is a non-zero value.
8. **`c` and `d`**: New values returned by `r()`. If `c < d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Code Execution:
The print statement is:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are values returned by `r()`.
   - If `c < d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

2. **Calculate `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1`**:
   - Since `c` and `d` are indices, `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` will be used to access elements in the list `b`.
   - These indices must be valid, meaning they should be within the bounds of the list `b`.

3. **Access Elements in `b`**:
   - `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]` are the elements in the list `b` at the calculated indices.
   - The list `b` starts with \([0, 0]\) and has subsequent elements based on the cumulative sums of conditions applied to the list `a`.

4. **Compute the Difference**:
   - The difference `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` is computed and printed.

### Final Output:
Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for `c` and `d`, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `b` at the specified indices.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where `c` and `d` are values returned by `r()`, and `b` is a list of cumulative sums based on conditions applied to the list `a`)**
