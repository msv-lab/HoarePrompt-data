Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the first integer read from the input, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities; `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, representing the positions of the cities on the number line; `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries; and `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the start and end cities for each query. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `r` is a lambda function that reads input and returns a map object of integers.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    r()
    a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
    b = [0, 0]
    for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
        v = y - x
        b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
    print(b, 'B')
    u, = r()
    while u:
        u -= 1
        c, d = r()
        if c < d:
            print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
        else:
            print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains the first integer read from the input minus 1, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` remains an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, and must have at least 4 elements; `m` remains an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `queries` remains a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `b` is a list where the first two elements are `[0, 0]`, and subsequent elements are the cumulative sums of the conditions `(v > x - w)` and `(v > z - y)` applied to each triplet `(w, x, y, z)` in the list `a`. The length of `b` will be `len(a) - 2`; `u` is the value returned by `r()` minus the total number of iterations the loop executed, which must evaluate to `False` (i.e., 0); `c` and `d` are the final values returned by `r()` during the last iteration of the loop. If `c` < `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is the first integer read from the input minus 2, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and `t` must be greater than 0; `n` remains an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, and must have at least 4 elements; `m` remains an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `queries` remains a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `b` is a list where the first two elements are `[0, 0]`, and subsequent elements are the cumulative sums of the conditions `(v > x - w)` and `(v > z - y)` applied to each triplet `(w, x, y, z)` in the list `a`. The length of `b` will be `len(a) - 2`; `u` is 0; `c` and `d` are the last two elements returned by the function `r()` before `u` became 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `u` is 0, `c` and `d` are the last two values returned by `r()` before `u` became 0. The list `b` contains the accumulated values based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified in the loop. All other variables (`a`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `queries`) remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
