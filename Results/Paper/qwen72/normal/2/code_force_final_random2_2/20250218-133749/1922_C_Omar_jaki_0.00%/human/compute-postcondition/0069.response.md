To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: The first integer read from the input minus 2, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and `t` must be greater than 0.
   - Example: If the input is 5, then `t = 5 - 2 = 3`.

2. **`n`**: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
   - Example: `n = 100`.

3. **`a`**: A list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`. The list must have at least 4 elements.
   - Example: `a = [-1000000000.0, r(), r(), ..., 2000000000.0]`.

4. **`m`**: An integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.
   - Example: `m = 50`.

5. **`queries`**: A list of `m` pairs `(x_i, y_i)` where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i.
   - Example: `queries = [(1, 2), (3, 4), ...]`.

6. **`b`**: A list where the first two elements are `[0, 0]`, and subsequent elements are the cumulative sums of the conditions `(v > x - w)` and `(v > z - y)` applied to each triplet `(w, x, y, z)` in the list `a`. The length of `b` will be `len(a) - 2`.
   - Example: `b = [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...]`.

7. **`u`**: The first element returned by the function `r()` minus 2 and must be non-zero.
   - Example: If `r()` returns 5, then `u = 5 - 2 = 3`.

8. **`c` and `d`**: The next two elements returned by the function `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, the program continues with these values. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, and the program continues with these values.
   - Example: If `r()` returns 7 and 4, then `c = 7` and `d = 4`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

1. **Calculate Indices**:
   - `d - 1`: This is the index in the list `b` that is used to access the element.
   - `c - 1`: This is another index in the list `b` that is used to access the element.
   - Both indices are multiplied by 2 because the list `b` is structured such that every other element is part of the cumulative sum.

2. **Access Elements in `b`**:
   - `b[(d - 1) * 2]`: Access the element at the index `(d - 1) * 2`.
   - `b[(c - 1) * 2]`: Access the element at the index `(c - 1) * 2`.

3. **Subtract the Values**:
   - The result of the subtraction `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` is printed.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `d = 4` and `c = 7`.
  - `d - 1 = 3`
  - `c - 1 = 6`
  - `(d - 1) * 2 = 6`
  - `(c - 1) * 2 = 12`
  - If `b = [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]`, then:
    - `b[6] = 5`
    - `b[12] = 11`
    - `b[6] - b[12] = 5 - 11 = -6`

### Final Output:
Based on the given initial state and the structure of the list `b`, the output will be the result of the subtraction of the elements at the specified indices.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where b is the list described in the initial state, and d and c are the values returned by the function r())**
