Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the first integer read from the input minus 1, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities; `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`; `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries; `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the start and end cities for each query; `b` is a list `[0, 0]`.
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the first integer read from the input minus 1, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, and must have at least 4 elements, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, `b` is `[0, 0, v

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the first integer read from the input minus 1, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list starting with the second element of the previous state, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, and must have at least 4 elements, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, `b` is [0, 0, v, 0 + v

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the first integer read from the input minus 1, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list starting with the second element of the previous state, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, and must have at least 5 elements; `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `b` is `[0, 0, v, v, v + v




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
