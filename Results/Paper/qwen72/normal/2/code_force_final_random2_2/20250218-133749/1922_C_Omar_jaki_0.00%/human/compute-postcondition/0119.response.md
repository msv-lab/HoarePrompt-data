The function `func` accepts no direct parameters but is expected to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes the following inputs:
- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities.
- `a`: A list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, representing the positions of the cities on the number line.
- `m`: An integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries.
- `queries`: A list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the start and end cities for each query.

For each query (x_i, y_i), the function calculates the distance between the city at position x_i and the city at position y_i on the number line. The function returns a list of distances corresponding to each query for all test cases.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing the number of cities, their positions on a number line, the number of queries, and the queries themselves. It returns a list of distances between the specified cities for each query in all test cases.**
