To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).
- `_` is a throwaway variable.
- `m` is an integer such that \(m \geq 1\).
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `ans` is a boolean variable that starts as `True`.

### Loop Logic:
- The loop iterates through the list `arr` starting from index 1 (i.e., `i = 1`).
- For each iteration, it checks if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`.
  - If this condition is true, it updates `arr[i - 1]` to the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]`.
  - It then checks if the resulting `arr` list is not sorted (`nums != sorted(nums)`).
  - If both conditions are met, `ans` is set to `False` and the loop terminates early.
- If the loop completes without setting `ans` to `False`, `ans` remains `True`.

### Print Statement:
- The `print` statement outputs either `'NO'` or `'YES'` based on the value of `ans`.
- If `ans` is `True`, it prints `'YES'`.
- If `ans` is `False`, it prints `'NO'`.

### Analysis:
- The key to determining the output is understanding the value of `ans` after the loop.
- If the loop finds any `i` such that `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the resulting `arr` is not sorted, `ans` will be set to `False`.
- If no such `i` is found, `ans` will remain `True`.

### Conclusion:
- The output depends on whether the loop encounters a condition where `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the resulting `arr` is not sorted.
- If such a condition is found, the output will be `'NO'`.
- If no such condition is found, the output will be `'YES'`.

Given the initial state and the logic of the loop, the final output will be:

Output: **['NO', 'YES'][ans] (where ans is True if no condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and `nums != sorted(nums)` is met during the loop, otherwise False)**

In simpler terms:
- If the loop completes without finding any unsorted condition, the output will be:
  Output: **YES**
- If the loop finds an unsorted condition, the output will be:
  Output: **NO**
