The code snippet `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to the first element of the list `nums`. Let's break down the impact:

- `arr[i - 1]` is updated to the value of `nums[0]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, `ans`, `nums`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50
- `_` is a throwaway variable
- `m` is an integer such that m >= 2
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
- `i` is `m - 2`
- `ans` remains True unless `nums` is not sorted, in which case `ans` becomes False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement
- `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`

After executing the code snippet:
- `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 2`, `ans` remains True unless `nums` is not sorted, in which case `ans` becomes False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`.**
