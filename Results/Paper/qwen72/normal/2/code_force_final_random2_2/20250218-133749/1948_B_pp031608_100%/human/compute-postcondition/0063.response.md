To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `range(m - 1, 0, -1)`.
2. **Range Function**: The `range(m - 1, 0, -1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from `m - 1` down to 1 (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.
3. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute, the start value of the range (`m - 1`) must be greater than or equal to the stop value (1). This means `m - 1` must be at least 1, which implies `m` must be at least 2.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Variable `m`**: Ensure `m` is at least 2.
- **Variable `i`**: The initial value of `i` should be `m - 1`.

### Final State:
Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= 49
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `m` is an input integer such that m >= 1
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
- `i` is 1
- `ans` is True

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute:
- `m` must be at least 2.
- `i` should be `m - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= 49, `_` is incremented by 1, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 1`, `ans` is True**
