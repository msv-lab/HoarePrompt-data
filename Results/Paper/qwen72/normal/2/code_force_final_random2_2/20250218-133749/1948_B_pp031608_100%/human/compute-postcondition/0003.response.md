The code snippet `arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50
- `_` is a throwaway variable
- `m` is an input integer

After executing the code snippet, the list `arr` will contain the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**
