Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it handles the transformation and checking of the array. Specifically, the program only checks and modifies the array in a limited way, which may not cover all necessary transformations to ensure the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
12 3 45 67
```
The program will process this as follows:
- It starts from the end of the array and checks if `67` is less than `45`. Since it is not, it moves to the next pair.
- It then checks if `45` is less than `3`. Since it is not, it moves to the next pair.
- Finally, it checks if `3` is less than `12`. Since it is, it attempts to split `12` into `[1, 2]` and adds `3` to the list, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`.

However, the program does not correctly handle the transformation of `45` and `67` to check if the array can be sorted. The correct transformation would involve splitting `45` into `[4, 5]` and `67` into `[6, 7]`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, which is sorted.

Thus, the program fails to correctly determine that the array can be sorted by the allowed operations, leading to an incorrect output of `NO` instead of `YES`.

This demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, hence the correctness is **False**.
