Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, read from the input. Each test case consists of a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    ans = True
    for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
            if nums != sorted(nums):
                ans = False
                break
            arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
    print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an integer such that m >= 1, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 0, `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the subsequent check `nums != sorted(nums)` were met during any iteration of the loop. If the loop encountered a condition where `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the resulting `nums` list was not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the loop terminates early. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. The elements of `arr` may have been modified according to the rules specified in the loop, particularly where `arr[i - 1]` is updated to the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]` if the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 49, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 1, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1, `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the condition inside the loop was met and the list `nums` remained sorted throughout all iterations. If at any point `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= 49, `_` is incremented by 1, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 1, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True unless the loop encountered a condition where `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the resulting `nums` list was not sorted, in which case `ans` is set to False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
