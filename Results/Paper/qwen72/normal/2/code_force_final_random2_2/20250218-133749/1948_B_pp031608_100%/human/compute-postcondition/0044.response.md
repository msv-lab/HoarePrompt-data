Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 49, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 2`, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list formed by converting `arr[i - 1]` to a list of its digits and appending `arr[i]` to it.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet creates a new list `nums` by converting the integer `arr[i - 1]` into a list of its digits and then appending `arr[i]` to this list.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The new list `nums` is formed based on the current values of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`.
