The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case starts with an integer `n`, followed by a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function checks if the list can be made non-decreasing by modifying at most one element. If it can, the function prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function terminates without returning any value.
