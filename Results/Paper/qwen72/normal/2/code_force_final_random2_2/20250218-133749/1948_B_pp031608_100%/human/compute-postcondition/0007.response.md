The code snippet converts the integer `arr[i - 1]` into a list of its digits and concatenates this list with a list containing the integer `arr[i]`. Let's break down the impact:

- `arr[i - 1]` is converted to a string, and each character (digit) is converted back to an integer and added to a list.
- This list of digits is then concatenated with a list containing the single element `arr[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
- `_` is a throwaway variable.
- `m` is an integer such that m >= 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `ans` is True.
- `i` is m - 1.
- The current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`.

After executing the code:
- `nums` is a new list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is True, `i` is m - 1, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
