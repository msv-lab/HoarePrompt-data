Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `r` is either `a[1]` or `a[2]`, `y` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `rem` is 0, `k` is `-2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.***
