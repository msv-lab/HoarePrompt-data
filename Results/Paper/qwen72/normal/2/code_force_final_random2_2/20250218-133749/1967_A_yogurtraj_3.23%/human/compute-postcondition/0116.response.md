Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `k` is decreased by `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`, `y` is `n - 2`, `rem` is `k % 3`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rem` is calculated as `k % (i + 1)`. Since `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3. Therefore, `rem` is `k % 3`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
