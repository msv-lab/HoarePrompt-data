The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the loop runs from 0 to `n-1`, meaning there must be at least two elements (0 and 1) for the loop to run at least once.

Given the initial state, `n` is the first integer from user input, and the user input must be greater than 1. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` should start at 0 as per the loop definition.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from user input, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0**
