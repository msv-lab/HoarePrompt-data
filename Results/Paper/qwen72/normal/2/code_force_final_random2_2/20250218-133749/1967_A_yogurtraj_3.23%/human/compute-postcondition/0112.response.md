Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `rem` is 0, `k` is decreased by `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is equal to `a[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `r` is assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`. Since `i` is 1, `r` is assigned the value of `a[2]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
