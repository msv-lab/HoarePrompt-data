The code snippet updates the value of `k` by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its current value. Let's break down the impact:

- `i` is 2.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `k` is initially decreased by `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.

The new calculation for `k` is:
\[ k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) \]
Substituting the values:
\[ k -= (2 + 1) * (a[3] - a[2]) \]
\[ k -= 3 * (a[3] - a[2]) \]

So, the new value of `k` is:
\[ k = k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2]) \]

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `rem` is 0, `k` is decreased by `2 * (a[2] - a[1]) + 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, `r` is equal to `a[2]`, `y` is `n - 2`.**
