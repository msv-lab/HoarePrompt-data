Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from user input, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n - 1`, `y` is either `n - 1 - j` where `j` is the index at which the condition `(j + 1) * (a[j + 1] - a[j]) > k` was first met, or 0 if the condition was never met, `r` is `a[0]`, `rem` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `rem` to 0, overriding any previous value it might have had. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
