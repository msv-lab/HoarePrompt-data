Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `ii` is 0.
- `n` is the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
- `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
- `rem` is the final value of `rem` after the loop completes.
- `y` is the final value of `y` after the loop completes.
- `k` is not 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `n`**:
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`.

2. **Determine `r`**:
   - `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.
   - `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.

3. **Calculate `(r - 1) * n + 1`**:
   - First, compute `r - 1`.
   - Then, multiply the result by `n`.
   - Finally, add 1 to the product.

### Explanation:
- `a[n - 1]` is the largest element in the sorted list `a`.
- `k // n` is the integer part of the division of `k` by `n`.
- `r` is the sum of the largest element in `a` and the integer part of `k // n`.
- The expression `(r - 1) * n + 1` simplifies to:
  - `(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1`
  - This can be expanded to:
    - `a[n - 1] * n + (k // n - 1) * n + 1`
    - Which further simplifies to:
      - `a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1`

### Final Output:
The code will print the value of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1`, which is derived from the largest element in the list `a`, the length of the list `n`, and the integer division of `k` by `n`.

Output: **(a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1) (where a[n - 1] is the largest element in the list `a`, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `k` is the given integer)**
