To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `ii` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. **Variable `ii`**: This variable is used as the loop counter and is initialized to 0 by the `range` function.
2. **Result of `int(input())`**: This represents the number of iterations the loop will perform. It should be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the problem statement, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. This means that the input provided to `int(input())` should be equal to `t` for the loop to execute correctly.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is a positive integer and `ii` is initialized to 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 0**
