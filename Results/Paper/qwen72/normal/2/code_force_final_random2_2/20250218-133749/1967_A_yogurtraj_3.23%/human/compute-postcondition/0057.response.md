Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `r` is `a[0] + 0 // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `0 % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1`, `i` is 0, and the condition `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > 0` holds true. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
