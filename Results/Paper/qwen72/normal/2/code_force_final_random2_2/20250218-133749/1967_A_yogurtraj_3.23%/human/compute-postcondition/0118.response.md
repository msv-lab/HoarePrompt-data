Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3` which simplifies to `a[2]`, `y` is `n - 3`, `rem` is `k % 3` which simplifies to 0.**
