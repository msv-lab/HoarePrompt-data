Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `y` is 0, `rem` is `k % 2`, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rem` is updated to `k % 2` because `i` is 1, so `i + 1` is 2.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
