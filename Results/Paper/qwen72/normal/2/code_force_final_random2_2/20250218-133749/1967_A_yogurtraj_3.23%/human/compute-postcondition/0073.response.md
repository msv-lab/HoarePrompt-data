Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `y` is 0, `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is `a[2] + (k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])) // 3`, `rem` is `k % 3`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rem` is calculated as `k % (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `k % 3` because `i` is 2.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
