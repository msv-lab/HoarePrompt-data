Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the values of \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \), followed by the string \( s \).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings and creates a set `alphabet` containing the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets.
   - **Loop through String**: The loop iterates through each character in \( s \). If the character is in `alphabet`, it is added to `s1`. If the size of `alphabet` is greater than 1, the character is removed from `alphabet`. If `alphabet` has only one character left, the character is added to `s2` and `alphabet` is reset.
   - **Post-Loop State**: After the loop, `s1` contains all characters from \( s \) that were in `alphabet` at the time they were processed. `s2` contains the last character of \( s \) if it was the only remaining character in `alphabet` when the loop reached it, otherwise, `s2` remains an empty string.
   - **Return Values**: The function returns a tuple with three elements:
     - A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to \( n \times k \).
     - A substring of `s1` starting from index \( r \times k \) to the end of `s1`.
     - The value of `s2`.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - If the boolean returned by `func_1` is `False`, the program appends "No" to the output list and constructs a string of length \( n \) that does not occur as a subsequence of \( s \) by appending the missing character (if any) to `s2`.
   - If the boolean is `True`, the program appends "Yes" to the output list.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where \( n \) or \( k \) are small, and the string \( s \) is short.
   - It correctly identifies when all possible strings of length \( n \) can be formed using the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets and when they cannot.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The program efficiently processes the input within the constraints provided, ensuring that the sum of \( m \) and the sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 10^6 \).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
