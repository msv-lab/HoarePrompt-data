Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Subsequence Checking**: The function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the string `s`. It only checks if the length of the string `s1` (which is a modified version of `s`) is at least `n * k`, which is not sufficient to ensure that all possible combinations of length `n` are present.

2. **Generating Missing Subsequence**: When the function determines that not all subsequences are present, it generates a missing subsequence by appending a character that is not in `s1`. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the generated string is one of the missing subsequences of length `n`.

3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic used to generate `s1` and `s2` is not clear and does not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the way `alphabet` is used and modified does not ensure that all possible subsequences are checked.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to:
- Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
- If any string is not a subsequence, print "NO" and the missing string.
- If all strings are subsequences, print "YES".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(x, y):
    it = iter(y)
    return all(c in it for c in x)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    
    # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k lowercase English alphabets
    all_possible_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
    
    # Check if each possible string is a subsequence of s
    found_all = True
    missing_string = None
    for possible_string in all_possible_strings:
        if not is_subsequence(possible_string, s):
            found_all = False
            missing_string = possible_string
            break
    
    if found_all:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
        print(missing_string)
```

This corrected version ensures that all possible strings of length `n` are checked against the input string `s` to determine if they are subsequences. If any string is missing, it prints "NO" followed by the missing string. Otherwise, it prints "YES".
