### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and stores the results in a list `OUT`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings and creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is in the `alphabet` set, it removes `i` from the set.
     - If the set `alphabet` has only one element left, it adds `i` to `s2` and resets the set `alphabet` to its original state.
     - It appends `i` to `s1`.
   - After the loop, it calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple containing:
     - A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - A substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end.
     - The value of `s2`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - If the boolean returned by `func_1` is `False`, it appends "No" to `OUT` and constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s` by appending the missing character (if any) to `s2`.
   - If the boolean is `True`, it appends "Yes" to `OUT`.
   - Finally, it prints the contents of `OUT`.

### Analysis of Correctness:
- **Subsequence Check:** The function `func_1` attempts to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`. However, the logic used to construct `s1` and `s2` is flawed. The set `alphabet` is reset too frequently, and the substring `s1[r * k:]` does not necessarily represent a valid subsequence of length `n`.
- **Missing Subsequences:** The program does not correctly identify all possible subsequences of length `n` that should be checked. The logic for constructing the missing subsequence is also incorrect, as it does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid subsequence that does not appear in `s`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for checking subsequences and constructing missing subsequences is flawed.

### Correctness:
**False**
