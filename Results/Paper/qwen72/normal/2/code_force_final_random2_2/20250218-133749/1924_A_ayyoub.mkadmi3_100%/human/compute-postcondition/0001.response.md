Output State: **s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k and n are integers such that 1 ≤ k, n ≤ 26, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6, s1 is an empty string, s2 is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes `s2` as an empty string. This does not affect the values of `s`, `k`, `n`, or `s1`. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the new variable `s2` being an empty string.
