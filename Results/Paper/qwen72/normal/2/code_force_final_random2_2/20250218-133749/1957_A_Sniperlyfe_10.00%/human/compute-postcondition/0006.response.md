The code updates the frequency count of `n` in the dictionary `freq`. Since `n` is already a key in `freq` with a value of 2, the new value of `freq[n]` will be 2 + 1, which is 3. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 3 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i, `freq` is a dictionary with the key `n` and its value is 3, `n` is the third element in `arr`.**
