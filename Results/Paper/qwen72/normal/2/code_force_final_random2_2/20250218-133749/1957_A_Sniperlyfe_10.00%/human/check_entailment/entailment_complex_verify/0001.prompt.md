You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i, `freq` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr`, and the value for each key is the number of times that integer appears in `arr`.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 4. Each value in `freq` represents the frequency of an integer in the list `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` (where the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100, and each element is between 1 and 100) and returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique integer in `arr` by 4. The function does not modify the input list `arr`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks, where each stick can only be used once and no stick can be broken.

2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks into a list `arr`.

3. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary `freq`. This is done correctly by iterating over the list `arr` and updating the count for each stick length.

4. **Polygon Construction**: A regular polygon requires at least 3 sides, but the program is summing the number of groups of 4 sticks of the same length (`v // 4`). This is incorrect because a regular polygon can have any number of sides greater than or equal to 3, not just 4.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1(arr)` for each test case, which is the sum of the number of groups of 4 sticks of the same length. This does not match the problem requirement of finding the maximum number of regular polygons.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it only considers groups of 4 sticks, which is not sufficient to cover all possible regular polygons (e.g., triangles, pentagons, etc.).

Correctness: **False**
