Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i, `freq` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr`, and the value for each key is the number of times that integer appears in `arr`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all iterations, the `freq` dictionary will contain the frequency count of each unique integer in the `arr` list. The keys in the `freq` dictionary will be the integers from `arr`, and the values will be the counts of how many times each integer appears in `arr`. The length of `arr` and the range of values in `arr` remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
