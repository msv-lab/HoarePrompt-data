Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks, where each stick can only be used once and no stick can be broken. Regular polygons can have any number of sides greater than or equal to 3.

2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks into a list `arr`.

3. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary `freq`. This is done correctly by iterating over the list `arr` and updating the count for each stick length.

4. **Polygon Construction**: The program sums the number of groups of 4 sticks of the same length (`v // 4`). This is incorrect because a regular polygon can have any number of sides greater than or equal to 3, not just 4. For example, a triangle requires 3 sticks, a square requires 4 sticks, a pentagon requires 5 sticks, and so on. The current implementation only considers groups of 4 sticks, which means it will miss out on constructing other valid polygons like triangles and pentagons.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1(arr)` for each test case, which is the sum of the number of groups of 4 sticks of the same length. This does not match the problem requirement of finding the maximum number of regular polygons.

Given the above reasoning, the program is indeed incorrect because it only considers groups of 4 sticks, which is not sufficient to cover all possible regular polygons.

Final: **False**
