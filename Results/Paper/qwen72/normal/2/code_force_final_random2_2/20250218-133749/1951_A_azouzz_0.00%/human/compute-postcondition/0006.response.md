Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed.
- The current directory contains subfolders named with digits, and some of these subfolders may contain `.html` files.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string.
- `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`, and `cnt1` is greater than 2 and is an even number.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This code simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Since the print statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, it will always print the same output regardless of the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `cnt1`.

Output: **YES**
