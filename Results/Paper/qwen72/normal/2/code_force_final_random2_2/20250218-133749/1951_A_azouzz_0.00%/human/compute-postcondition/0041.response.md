The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the context provided, it is implied that the function processes subfolders within the current directory, which are named with digits ranging from `start` to `end`, where `start` and `end` are integers and `start <= end`. The function checks each subfolder in this range to see if it contains `.html` files.

Functionality: **The function processes subfolders within the current directory named with digits ranging from `start` to `end` (inclusive). It checks each subfolder in this range to determine if it contains any `.html` files.**
