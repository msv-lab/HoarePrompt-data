Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the optimal position to place a road in a village so that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side. The solution involves iterating through the string `s` to calculate the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each position and checking if these counts meet the satisfaction criteria. The program keeps track of all valid positions and selects the one closest to the middle of the village. If no valid positions are found, it checks the overall satisfaction and places the road accordingly.

Here are the key points to consider for correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually, reading `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Middle Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the middle position `pk` as `n // 2`.

3. **Cumulative Counts**: The program maintains cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each position `i` and calculates the percentages of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the road, respectively.

4. **Satisfaction Check**: The program checks if the percentages of '0's on the left side and '1's on the right side are at least 50%.

5. **Valid Positions**: The program collects all valid positions where the road can be placed.

6. **Optimal Position Selection**: The program selects the position closest to the middle of the village. If multiple positions have the same distance to the middle, it selects the smallest one.

7. **Fallback Case**: If no valid positions are found, the program checks the overall satisfaction and places the road before the first house if the majority prefers the right side, or after the last house if the majority prefers the left side.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
