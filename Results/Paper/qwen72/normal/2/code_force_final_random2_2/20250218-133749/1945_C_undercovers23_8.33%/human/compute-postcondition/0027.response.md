The value of `zero` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 1, `zero` is 2 if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is '0' and `one` is 0, otherwise `zero` is 1 and `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is `[1]` if the percentage of '0's up to the current index (`zero_perc`) is at least 50% and the percentage of '1's from the next index to the end of the string (`one_perc`) is also at least 50%, otherwise `lst` remains an empty list.**
