Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of the original `mini` value (100,000,000) and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`, `i` is `n - 1`, `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered in the string `s` up to the last iteration, `one` is the total number of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the last iteration, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` must contain at least one element, `ele` is the first element in `lst`.**
