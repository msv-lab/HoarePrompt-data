Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100,000,000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
    one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 0, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is '0' and `one` is 0, otherwise `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. If the percentage of '0's up to the current index (`zero_perc`) is at least 50% and the percentage of '1's from the next index to the end of the string (`one_perc`) is also at least 50%, then `lst` is `[1]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 1, `zero` is 2 and `one` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0'; otherwise, `zero` is 1 and `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', or `zero` is 0 and `one` is 2 if `s[i]` is '1', `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. If `zero_perc` is at least 50% and `one_perc` is at least 50%, `lst` is `[1, 2]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 2, `zero` is the same as before, `one` is the same as before, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / 3)`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is the same as before unless `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, in which case `lst` includes the value 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
