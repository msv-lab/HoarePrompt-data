The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, the function implicitly accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the number of houses, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. Since the specific output is not provided, we can infer that the function likely returns some form of analysis or computation based on the string `a` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of houses and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
