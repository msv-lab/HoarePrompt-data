Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer representing the number of houses, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n % 2 == 0:
        pk = n // 2
    else:
        pk = n // 2
    sl = list(s)
    o = sl.count('1')
    z = sl.count('0')
    zero, one = 0, 0
    lst = []
    mini = pow(10, 8)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == '0':
            zero += 1
        else:
            one += 1
        zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
        one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
        if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
            lst.append(i + 1)
    for ele in lst:
        mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
    final = []
    for elem in lst:
        if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
            final.append(elem)
    final.sort()
    if len(final) == 0:
        c1 = o * 100 // n
        if c1 >= 50:
            final.append(0)
        else:
            final.append(n)
    print(final[0])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of 100,000,000 and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 1`, `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered in the string `s` up to the last iteration, `one` is the total number of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the last iteration, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were at least 50% during the iterations, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, the length of `final` is 1. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` now contains `n` and the length of `final` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the new input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the new `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in the new `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of the original `mini` and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 1`, `zero` is the total number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the total number of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` (the integer division of `o * 100` by `n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now includes the integer `0`. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` now includes the integer `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *After all iterations of the loop, `final` contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, sorted in ascending order. If `len(final) == 0`, and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` contains `[0]` and has a length of 1. If `len(final) == 0` and `c1` is less than 50, `final` contains the single element `n`, sorted in ascending order, and has a length of 1. The state of other variables (`i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `ele`, `mini`) remains unchanged, except `c1` which is now equal to `o * 100 // n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
