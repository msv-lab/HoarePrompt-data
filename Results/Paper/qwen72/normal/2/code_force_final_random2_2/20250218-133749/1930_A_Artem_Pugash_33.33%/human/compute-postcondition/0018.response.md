Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer where 1 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings in ascending order with the first five elements removed, `a` is the integer value of the fourth element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the fifth element that was removed from `numbers`, `suma` is \(3 \times \text{min}(a, b)\).** 

Explanation: The code `suma += min(a, b)` adds the minimum of `a` and `b` to the current value of `suma`. Initially, `suma` is \(2 \times \text{min}(a, b)\). After adding `min(a, b)` to `suma`, the new value of `suma` becomes \(2 \times \text{min}(a, b) + \text{min}(a, b) = 3 \times \text{min}(a, b)\). All other variables remain unchanged.
