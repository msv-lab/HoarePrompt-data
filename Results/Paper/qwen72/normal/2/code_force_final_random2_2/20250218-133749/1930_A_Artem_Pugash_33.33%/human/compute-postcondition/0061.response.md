Functionality: ** The function reads and processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It then sorts the list in ascending order and repeatedly removes pairs of integers, adding the smaller of the two to a running sum. After processing all pairs, it prints the sum. The function handles up to 5000 test cases, with each `n` ranging from 1 to 50 and each integer in the list ranging from 1 to 10^7. After the function concludes, the input has been fully processed, and the sums for each test case have been printed. **
