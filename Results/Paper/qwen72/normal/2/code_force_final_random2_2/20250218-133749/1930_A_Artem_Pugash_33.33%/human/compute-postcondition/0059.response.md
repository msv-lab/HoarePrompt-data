Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer where 1 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000, `i` is `numCases - 1`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers` for each test case.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged as it represents the total number of test cases, which is defined before the loop starts.
- **`numCases`**: This variable also remains unchanged as it is the total number of test cases and is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `numCases - 1`. This is because the loop runs from `0` to `numCases - 1`.
- **`numInteger`**: This variable is set to the input integer for each test case, but its value changes with each iteration of the loop.
- **`numbers`**: After each test case, `numbers` is an empty list because all elements are popped out during the processing of each test case.
- **`suma`**: For each test case, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers`. After all iterations, `suma` will have been printed for each test case, but the final value of `suma` will be the result of the last test case processed.
