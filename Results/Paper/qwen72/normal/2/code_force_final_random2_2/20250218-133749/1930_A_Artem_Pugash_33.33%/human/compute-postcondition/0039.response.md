Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `numCases` is an integer where 1 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000.
- `i` is 1.
- `numInteger` is an input integer.
- `numbers` is an empty list.
- `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of consecutive elements from the original `numbers` list.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(suma)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`numbers` List**: The `numbers` list is initially empty.
2. **`suma` Calculation**: The variable `suma` is described as the sum of the minimum values of each pair of consecutive elements from the `numbers` list. Since `numbers` is empty, there are no pairs of consecutive elements to consider.
3. **Sum of Minimum Values**: When there are no elements in the list, the sum of the minimum values of pairs of consecutive elements is 0.

### Conclusion:
Since `numbers` is empty, `suma` will be 0. Therefore, the `print(suma)` statement will print 0.

Output: **0**
