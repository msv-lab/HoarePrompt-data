Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer where 1 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of consecutive elements from the original `numbers` list.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 to 5000.
- **`numCases`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 to 5000.
- **`i`**: Remains 1, as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`numInteger`**: Remains the same input integer, as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`numbers`**: Becomes an empty list because all elements are popped out during the loop execution.
- **`suma`**: Contains the sum of the minimum values of each pair of consecutive elements from the original `numbers` list. This is because in each iteration, two elements are popped from the list, and the minimum of these two elements is added to `suma`.

This final state reflects the complete execution of the loop, where all elements in the `numbers` list have been processed, and `suma` holds the cumulative sum of the minimum values of each pair of consecutive elements.
