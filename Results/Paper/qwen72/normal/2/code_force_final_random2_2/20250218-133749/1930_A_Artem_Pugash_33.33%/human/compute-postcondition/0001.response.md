To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `numCases`.

- `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `numCases - 1`.
- `numCases` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- A list of 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
- `numCases` is the integer input provided by the user, which is within the range 1 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000.

For the loop to execute, `numCases` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer where 1 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000, `i` is 0**
