Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of sale days (`n`), the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day (`m`), the total number of tickets to be bought (`k`), and a list of ticket prices for each day (`a`). It calculates and prints the minimum total cost required to buy exactly `k` tickets across the given `n` days, ensuring no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
