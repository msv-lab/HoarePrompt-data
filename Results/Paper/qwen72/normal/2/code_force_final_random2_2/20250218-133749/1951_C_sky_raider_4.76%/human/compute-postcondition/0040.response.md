To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case is `i`.

### Given:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `m` is the new input integer.
- `k` is `k - n * min(m, k) - (n-1) * min(m, k)`.
- `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
- `s` is `min(m, k)`.
- `c` is `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * min(m, k) - min(m, k) * min(m, k) / 2 for j in range(n))`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`.
- The loop will execute if `i` is within the range specified by `int(input())`.

### Adjustments:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the value of `int(input())`.

### New State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `n`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`, `c`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n`, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the new input integer, `k` is `k - n * min(m, k) - (n-1) * min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * min(m, k) - min(m, k) * min(m, k) / 2 for j in range(n))`**.
