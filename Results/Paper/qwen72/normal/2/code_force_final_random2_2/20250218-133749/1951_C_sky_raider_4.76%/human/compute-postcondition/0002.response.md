The code reads a line of input and splits it into parts, converting each part into an integer and storing them in a list called `l`. The initial values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, but `l` is now a list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
