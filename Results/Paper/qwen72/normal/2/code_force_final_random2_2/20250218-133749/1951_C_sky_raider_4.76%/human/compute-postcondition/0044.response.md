Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is the new input integer `n`, `n` is the new input integer, `m` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer, `s` is 0, `c` is `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * min(m, k) - min(m, k) * min(m, k) / 2 for j in range(n))`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `s` to 0. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `c`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `s` is now explicitly 0, while the rest of the variables retain their initial conditions and values.
