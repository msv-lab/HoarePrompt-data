The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list `a`. Here, `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases, with each test case having:
- `n`: an integer representing the number of sale days (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5),
- `m`: an integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9),
- `k`: an integer representing the total number of tickets to be bought (1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)),
- `a`: a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` represents the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

The function returns the minimum total cost required to buy exactly `k` tickets across the given `n` days, considering the constraint that no more than `m` tickets can be bought on any single day.
