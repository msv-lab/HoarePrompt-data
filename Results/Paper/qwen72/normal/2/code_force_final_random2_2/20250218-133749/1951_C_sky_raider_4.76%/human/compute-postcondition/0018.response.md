Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the same as initially, `m` is the same as initially, `k` is `k - n * min(m, k)`, `l` is the same as initially, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is now equal to `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * s - s * s / 2 for j in range(n))`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After `n` iterations, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`m`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`k`**: Decreases by `min(m, k)` in each iteration. After `n` iterations, `k` will be `k - n * min(m, k)`.
- **`l`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`s`**: In each iteration, `s` is set to `min(m, k)`. Since `k` decreases in each iteration, `s` may change, but its value in the final state is the last computed `min(m, k)`.
- **`c`**: Initially, `c` is `k * k / 2`. In each iteration, `c` is incremented by `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`. After `n` iterations, `c` will be `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * s - s * s / 2 for j in range(n))`.
