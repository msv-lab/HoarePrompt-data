Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n`, `n` is the new input integer, `m` is the new input integer, `k` is `k - n * min(m, k)`, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is now equal to `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * s - s * s / 2 for j in range(n))`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `l` is the same as initially, but the code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates `l` to be a list of integers provided by the user.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, and `c`) remain as they were defined in the initial state, with their values and expressions unchanged.
