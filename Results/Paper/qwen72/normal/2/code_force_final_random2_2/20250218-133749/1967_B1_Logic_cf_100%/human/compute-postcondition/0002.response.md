The code snippet `[n, m] = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, assigning the first part to `n` and the second part to `m`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are positive integers, the input should be two strings that can be converted to positive integers.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the first and second parts of the input string respectively, `t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0**
