Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is 4
- `m` is 6
- `b` is 5
- `t` is greater than 0
- `T` is 1
- `ans` is 6

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(ans)
```

The value of `ans` is explicitly given as 6. Therefore, when the `print` statement is executed, it will print the value of `ans`.

Output: **6**
