The code snippet `[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]` converts the strings `n` and `m` to integers.

- `n` is converted from the string "4" to the integer 4.
- `m` is converted from the string "6" to the integer 6.
- `b` was initially defined as `min(n, m) + 1`. With the new integer values of `n` and `m`, `b` is now `min(4, 6) + 1`, which evaluates to `4 + 1 = 5`.
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `T` remains 1.
- `ans` was initially defined based on the integer values of `n` and `m`. With the new integer values of `n` and `m`, the calculation for `ans` is now valid.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is 4, `m` is 6, `b` is 5, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `ans` is now valid based on the integer values of `n` and `m`.**
