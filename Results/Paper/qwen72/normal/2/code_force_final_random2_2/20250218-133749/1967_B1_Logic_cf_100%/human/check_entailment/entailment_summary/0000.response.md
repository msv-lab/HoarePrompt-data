Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the implementation in the program does not correctly follow the problem's requirements. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the number of valid pairs is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Initialization of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This is incorrect because the number of valid pairs should start from 0 and be incremented based on the conditions specified in the problem.

2. **Loop and Calculation**: The loop iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, and for each `b`, it adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`. This calculation is incorrect because it does not consider the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be a heuristic that does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **GCD Calculation**: The program does not include any calculation or consideration of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\), which is crucial for determining whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
