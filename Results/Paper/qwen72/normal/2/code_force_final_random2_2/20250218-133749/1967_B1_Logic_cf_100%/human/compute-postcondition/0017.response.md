The code snippet `[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]` converts the string values of `n` and `m` to integers.

- `n` was "4" and is now 4.
- `m` was "6" and is now 6.
- `b` was previously undefined due to `n` and `m` being strings. Now that `n` and `m` are integers, `b` can be recalculated as `min(n, m) + 1`, which is `min(4, 6) + 1 = 5`.
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `T` remains 1.
- `ans` was previously undefined due to `n` and `m` being strings. Now that `n` and `m` are integers, `ans` can be recalculated based on the new integer values of `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` is 4, `m` is 6, `b` is 5, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `ans` can now be recalculated based on the integer values of `n` and `m`.**
