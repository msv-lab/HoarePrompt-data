The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Given that `b` is 2, the expression simplifies to `(n + 2) // 4`. Since `n` is at least 2, the minimum value of `(n + 2)` is 4, which when divided by 4 results in 1. Therefore, `ans` increases by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `m` is an integer and must be at least 2, `b` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n + 1`**.
