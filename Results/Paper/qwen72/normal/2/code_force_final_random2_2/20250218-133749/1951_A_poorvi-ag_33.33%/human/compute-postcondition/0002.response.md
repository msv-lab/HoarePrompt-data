To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start from 0 as per the `range(t)` function.

Given the initial state:
- `start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`.
- The current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range.
- Each of these subfolders may contain .html files.
- `t` is an input integer.
- `results` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` will start from 0.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list**
