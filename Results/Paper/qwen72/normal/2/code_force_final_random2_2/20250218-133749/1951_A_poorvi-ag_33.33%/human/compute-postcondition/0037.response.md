Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` remains the same, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string. The list `results` will contain `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration of the loop. Specifically, if `arr` contains exactly two '1's and the substring '11', the corresponding element in `results` is 'no'. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's but does not meet the exact two '1's and '11' condition, the corresponding element in `results` is 'yes'. If `arr` contains an odd number of '1's, the corresponding element in `results` is 'no'.**
