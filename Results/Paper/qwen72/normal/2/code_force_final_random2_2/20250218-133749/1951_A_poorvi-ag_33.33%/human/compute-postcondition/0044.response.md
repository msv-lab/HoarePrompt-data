Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` remains the same, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `results` is a non-empty list containing `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration of the loop, and all elements in `results` have been printed.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variables `start`, `end`, the current working directory structure, `t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The list `results` still contains `t` elements, each of which is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated during the loop. Additionally, all elements in `results` have been printed to the console.
