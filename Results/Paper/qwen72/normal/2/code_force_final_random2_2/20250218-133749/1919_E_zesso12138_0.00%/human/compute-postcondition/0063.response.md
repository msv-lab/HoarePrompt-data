Postcondition: ***`n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is now a list of `2*n + 1` integers with values updated from `new_dp`, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers initialized to 0, `j` is 0. If `dp[j]` is greater than 0, then: if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`; if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `new_dp[1]` is updated to `(new_dp[1] + dp[0]) % MOD`. If `dp[j]` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `new_dp`.***
