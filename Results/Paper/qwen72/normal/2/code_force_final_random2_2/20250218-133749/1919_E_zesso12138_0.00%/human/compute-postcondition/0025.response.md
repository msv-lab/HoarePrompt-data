The value of `index` is incremented by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `index` was initially `4 + 2*n`, after incrementing by `n`, `index` becomes `4 + 3*n`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*n]`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the slice `data[index:index + n]`, `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is `4 + 3*n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` appended with `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**
