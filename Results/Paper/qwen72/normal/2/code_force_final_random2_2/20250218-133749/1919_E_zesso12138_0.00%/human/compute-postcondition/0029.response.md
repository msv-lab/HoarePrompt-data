To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `res` and the list `results`.

For the loop to execute, the list `results` must contain at least one element. The state of `res` will be the first element of `results` when the loop starts.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` remains a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of the last `n` read from `data`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the last slice of `data` used to form `p`, `input` is still the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is still a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is `1 + t + (t * n)`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration and must have at least one element, `result` is the return value of the last call to `func_1(n, p)`, `res` is the first element of `results`**
