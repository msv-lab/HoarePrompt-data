Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is now a list of `2*n + 1` integers with values updated from `new_dp`, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers initialized to 0, `j` is 1, `new_dp[0]` is set to `(dp[1] % MOD)`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `new_dp[j - 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to its current value and then taking the result modulo `MOD`.
- Given `j` is 1, `j - 1` is 0, so `new_dp[0]` is updated.
- The value of `dp[1]` is added to `new_dp[0]` and then taken modulo `MOD`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
