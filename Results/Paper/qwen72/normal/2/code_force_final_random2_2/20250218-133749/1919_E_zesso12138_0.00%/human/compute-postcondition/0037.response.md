Functionality: ** The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers, which are then passed to another function `func_1`. The results of `func_1` for each test case are collected and printed one by one. After the function completes, the input variables `t`, `n`, and `p` retain their last read values, and the list `results` contains the return values from `func_1` for each test case. The function does not return any value directly but outputs the results to the standard output. **
