Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n, and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array a. The function `sys.stdin.read` is assigned to the variable `input`. `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string. `index` is 1. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    result = func_1(n, p)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the slice `data[2:2 + n]`, `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is `2 + n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the slice `data[index:index + n]`, `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is `3 + 2*n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` appended with `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*n]`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the slice `data[index:index + n]`, `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is `4 + 3*n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` appended with `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
