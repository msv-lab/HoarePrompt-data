Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*n]`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the slice `data[index:index + n]`, `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is `3 + 2*n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` appended with `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`.
- Since `index` was initially `3 + 2*n`, the new value of `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*n]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `p`, `input`, `data`, `index`, `results`, and `result`) remain unchanged.
