### Reasoning:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The `func_1` function uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to keep track of the number of ways to achieve each possible prefix sum at each step. This is a suitable approach for the problem because it allows us to efficiently count the number of valid sequences that can lead to the given sorted prefix sums.
   - The `dp` array is initialized with a single entry at the starting point (offset), and it is updated iteratively for each element in the array.

2. **State Transition**:
   - The state transition logic is correctly implemented. For each prefix sum, the program considers both possible transitions (adding 1 or subtracting 1) and updates the `new_dp` array accordingly.
   - The use of modulo `MOD` ensures that the values remain within the required range, preventing overflow.

3. **Final Result Calculation**:
   - After processing all elements, the program calculates the final prefix sum and returns the corresponding value from the `dp` array. This is done by adjusting the final sum with the `offset` to account for the shifted range of possible prefix sums.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The `func_2` function correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and processes multiple test cases. It parses the input into individual test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are collected in a list and printed one by one, ensuring that the output format matches the problem requirements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as the smallest possible input (n=1) and larger inputs (up to n=5000). It also correctly handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description, including the modulo operation.
   - The program correctly identifies invalid cases where no valid array `a` can produce the given sorted prefix sums (e.g., when the prefix sums are not consistent with the properties of an array of 1s and -1s).

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the solution for the given problem description and handles all edge cases and constraints appropriately.

Final: **True**
