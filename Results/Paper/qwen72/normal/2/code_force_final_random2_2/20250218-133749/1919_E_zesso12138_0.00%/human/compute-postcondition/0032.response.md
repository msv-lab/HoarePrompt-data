To determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **`t`**: A positive integer.
2. **`n`**: An integer value of the last `n` read from `data`.
3. **`p`**: A list of integers converted from the last slice of `data` used to form `p`.
4. **`input`**: Still the function `sys.stdin.read`.
5. **`data`**: A list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.
6. **`index`**: Calculated as `1 + t + (t * n)`.
7. **`results`**: A list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration and must have at least two elements.
8. **`result`**: The return value of the last call to `func_1(n, p)`.
9. **`res`**: The second element of `results`.

Given this information, we need to determine the value of `res`, which is the second element of the `results` list.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding `results`**:
   - `results` is a list that contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.
   - Since `results` must have at least two elements, the second element (`res`) is one of these return values.

2. **Understanding `res`**:
   - `res` is specifically the second element of `results`.
   - The exact value of `res` depends on the return value of the second call to `func_1(n, p)`.

3. **Determining the Value of `res`**:
   - Without the specific implementation of `func_1(n, p)`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `res`.
   - However, we know that `res` is the result of the second call to `func_1(n, p)`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(res)` statement will print the second element of the `results` list, which is the return value of the second call to `func_1(n, p)`.

Output: **res (where res is the second element of the results list, which is the return value of the second call to func_1(n, p))**
