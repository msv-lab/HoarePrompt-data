The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter since it's not used within the loop body. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is a positive integer.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer, indicating how many iterations are supposed to happen. Since `_` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must still be less than `t`.

Given that the loop is iterating over a fixed number of times defined by `t`, and assuming the loop has just completed one iteration, the state of `_` would increment by 1, but this is not explicitly tracked in the state. Instead, what matters is that `t` remains the same, and the loop can continue if there are still iterations left to complete.

Therefore, the state does not change in terms of the variables mentioned, but the implicit state of `_` (the loop counter) increments by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be a positive integer, and the loop counter `_` must be less than `t`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the slice `data[2:2 + n]`, `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is `2 + n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**
