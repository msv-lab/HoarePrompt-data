The code snippet `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` updates the variable `p` by converting a slice of the list `data` from index `index` to `index + n` into a list of integers. This means `p` now holds the integer values from the specified slice of `data`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `|p_i| ≤ n`, and `p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n`, representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array `a`
- `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string
- `index` is 2
- `results` is an empty list

After executing the code:
- `p` is updated to a list of integers converted from the slice `data[2:2 + n]`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the slice `data[2:2 + n]`, `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list.**
