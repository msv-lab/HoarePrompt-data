Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is now a list of `2*n + 1` integers with values updated from `new_dp`, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers initialized to 0, `j` is 2, `new_dp[3]` is `(dp[2] % MOD)`**

Explanation:
- The code updates `new_dp[j + 1]` which is `new_dp[3]` to be the sum of its current value and `dp[j]` (which is `dp[2]`), modulo `MOD`.
- Since `new_dp` was initially initialized to 0, `new_dp[3]` becomes `dp[2] % MOD`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
