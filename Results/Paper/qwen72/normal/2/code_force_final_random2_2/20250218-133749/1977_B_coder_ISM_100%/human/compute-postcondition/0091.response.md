The code snippet `s.append('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Since `s` was initially an empty list, after executing this line, `s` will contain one element, which is the string `'0'`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `length` is 30, `s` is `['0']`, `nalla` is `t`, `t` must be greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and the bit at position `i` in `x` is 0.**
