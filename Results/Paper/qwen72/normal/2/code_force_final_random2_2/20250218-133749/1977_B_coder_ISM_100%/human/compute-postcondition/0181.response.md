Output State: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or `'0'` depending on whether the bit at position `i` (which is now 2) in `x` is set to 1 or 0, followed by the string `'1'` if the bit at position `i` in `x` is set to 1, or followed by the string `'0'` if the bit at position `i` in `x` is not set to 1, and now followed by the string `'0'`, `flag` is either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions described in the initial state.**
