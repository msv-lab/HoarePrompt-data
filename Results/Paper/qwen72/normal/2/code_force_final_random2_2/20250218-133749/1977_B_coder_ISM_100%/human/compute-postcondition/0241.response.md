Output State: **`i` is 3, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each being either `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-1'`. The third element of `s` (i.e., `s[2]`) is now `'-1'`. If the second element of `s` (i.e., `s[1]`) is `'-1'` and the first element of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is `'1'`, then the second element of `s` is `'0'` and the first element remains `'1'`. Otherwise, the elements of `s` remain unchanged.**
