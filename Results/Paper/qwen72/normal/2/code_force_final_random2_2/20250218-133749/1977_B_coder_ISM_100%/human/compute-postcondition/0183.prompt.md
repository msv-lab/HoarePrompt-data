Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an empty list, `flag` is either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions described in the initial state.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(30):
    if x & pow(2, i):
        s.append('1')
    else:
        s.append('0')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or `'0'` depending on whether the bit at position `i` (which is 0) in `x` is set to 1 or 0, and `flag` is either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions described in the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or `'0'` depending on whether the bit at position `i` (which is now 1) in `x` is set to 1 or 0, followed by the string `'1'` if the bit at position `i` in `x` is set to 1, or followed by the string `'0'` if the bit at position `i` in `x` is not set to 1, and `flag` is either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions described in the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or `'0'` depending on whether the bit at position `i` (which is now 2) in `x` is set to 1 or 0, followed by the string `'1'` if the bit at position `i` in `x` is set to 1, or followed by the string `'0'` if the bit at position `i` in `x` is not set to 1. If the bit at position `i` in `x` is set to 1, `s` is now followed by the string `'1'`. Otherwise, `s` is now followed by the string `'0'`. `flag` is either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions described in the initial state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
