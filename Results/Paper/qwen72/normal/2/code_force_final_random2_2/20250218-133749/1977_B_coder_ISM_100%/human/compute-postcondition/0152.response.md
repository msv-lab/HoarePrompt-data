Output State: **`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements where `s[0]` is '1', `s[1]` is '0', and `s[1]` is now '0'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is '1'. Otherwise, `flag` is 0, or `s[29]` is not '0'. If `flag` is 1, `length` is 31, `s` is a list of 31 elements, with `s[29]` being '0' and `s[30]` being '1'. `s[0]` is now '-1'.**
