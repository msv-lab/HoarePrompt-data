Functionality: ** The function reads a series of positive integers `x` (where 1 â‰¤ x < 2^30) from user input, processes each integer to transform its binary representation according to specific rules, and prints the transformed binary string along with its length. The transformation involves replacing consecutive '1's with '-1' followed by '0', and handling carry-over operations when necessary. After processing all inputs, the function does not return any value but outputs the transformed binary strings and their lengths. **
