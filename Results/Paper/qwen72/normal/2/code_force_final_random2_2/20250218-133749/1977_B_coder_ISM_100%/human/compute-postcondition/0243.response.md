Output State: **`i` is 29, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each being either `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-1'`. After all 29 iterations, any consecutive `'1'` and `'-1'` pairs in the list `s` have been transformed such that the `'-1'` is moved one position to the left and becomes `'0'`, and the `'1'` remains unchanged. This transformation continues until no more such pairs exist. The final state of `s` will reflect these transformations, with the last element (`s[29]`) potentially being modified based on the conditions described in the initial state.**
