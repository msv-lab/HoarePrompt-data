Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x` with the least significant bit first, and `flag` is 0. If `flag` is true and `s[0]` is '0', then the current value of `s[0]` remains '0'. Otherwise, the current value of `s[0]` is '1'.***
