Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 0, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element corresponds to the binary representation of `x`, and `flag` is 0. If `flag` is true and `s[i]` is '0', then `s[i]` remains '0'. Otherwise, the state of the variables and the list `s` remains unchanged.***
