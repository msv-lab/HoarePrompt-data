Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each being either `'1'` or `'0'` depending on whether the corresponding bit in `x` is set to 1 or 0. If `flag` is 1, `s[2]` remains `'0'`, and `flag` remains 1. If `flag` is 0 and `s[1]` is `'1'` and `s[2]` is `'1'`, then `s[1]` is set to `'-1'`, and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s[1]` remains as it was, and `flag` is set to 0.**
