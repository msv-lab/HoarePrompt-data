The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. It reads the number of test cases `T` and for each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a list of `x` integers. The function then sorts this list and calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive elements in the list, including the gap between the last element and `n`. It prints the sum of these gaps plus `x - 2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
