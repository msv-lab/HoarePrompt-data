Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` must be greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned new values from the input, `y` is no longer 0, the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `count` is 0, `num` (which is `n - list0[-1]`) is 1, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` is decremented by 1 but still greater than 0.**
