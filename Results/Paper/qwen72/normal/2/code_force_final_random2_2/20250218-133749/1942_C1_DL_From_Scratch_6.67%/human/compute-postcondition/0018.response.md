Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` must be greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are now assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `y` is no longer 0, the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `count` is 2 if `num` is 1, otherwise `count` remains 1, `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 2, `num` is `list0[3] - list0[2] - 1`.***
