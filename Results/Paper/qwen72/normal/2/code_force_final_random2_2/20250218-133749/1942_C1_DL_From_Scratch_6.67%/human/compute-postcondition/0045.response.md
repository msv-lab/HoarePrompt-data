Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned new values from the input, `y` is no longer 0, the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `count` is the total number of times `num` was 1 during the loop execution, `num` is now `n - list0[-1]`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` is decremented by 1 but still greater than 0, `x` must be greater than 1, and `i` is `x - 2`. Additionally, `num` is currently 1.**
