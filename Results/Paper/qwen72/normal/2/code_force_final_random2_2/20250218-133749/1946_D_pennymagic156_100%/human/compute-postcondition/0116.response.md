Output State: **`i` is 27, `u` is `x >> 27 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `u` is updated to `x >> 27 & 1`, `v` is updated to `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `op`, `cnt`) remain unchanged. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
