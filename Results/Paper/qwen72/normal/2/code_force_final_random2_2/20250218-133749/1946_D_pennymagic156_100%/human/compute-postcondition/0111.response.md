Postcondition: ***`i` is 28, `u` is `x >> 28 & 1` (and `u` is not 0), `v` is `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])`. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `op`, `cnt`) remain unchanged. If `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is 0, and `ans` is the maximum of its original value and `cnt`, which is the number of elements in `a` where the bit at position 28 is 1. If `v` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
