Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 0, `v` is even, `op` is the 29th bit of the first element in `a`, `ai` is the result of `ai` XOR `val`, `val` is the first element in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ai` is updated to the result of `ai` XOR `val`. Since `ai` was initially 0, the new value of `ai` is simply `val`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
