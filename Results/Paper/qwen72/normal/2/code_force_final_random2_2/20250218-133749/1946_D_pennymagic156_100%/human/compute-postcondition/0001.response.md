Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).** 

Explanation: The code snippet `a = func_1()` updates the variable `a` to be the result of calling `func_1()`. According to the initial state, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\). The values of `n` and `x` remain as they were updated by `func_3()`, and no other changes are made to the initial state.
