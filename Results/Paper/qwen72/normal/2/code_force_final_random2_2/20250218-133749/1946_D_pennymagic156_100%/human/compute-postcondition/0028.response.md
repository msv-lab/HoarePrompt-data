Output State: **The value of `ai` is updated to `ai ^ val`. The values of `op`, `t`, and the next value of `val` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ai` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `ai` and `val`.
- The values of `op`, `t`, and the next value of `val` are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain unchanged from their initial state.
