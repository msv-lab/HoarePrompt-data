To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the loop head:

```python
for val in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only object in the loop head is the list `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `op`, `cnt`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not affect whether the loop will execute.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).

For the loop to execute, `a` must have at least one element. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1, and `a` must have at least one non-negative integer.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least one element, `val` is the first element in `a`**.
