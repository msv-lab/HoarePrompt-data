Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are a few specific issues:

1. **Handling of Input and Output**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are used to read input, but they do not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem description. The problem specifies that the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent block of input corresponds to a test case. The current implementation does not account for this structure.

2. **Logic for Finding Maximum k**: The logic inside `func_5` is complex and may not correctly handle all edge cases. For example, the program does not correctly handle the case where the array `a` is empty or contains only one element. Additionally, the bitwise operations and the conditions for updating `ans` and `t` are not clearly aligned with the problem's requirements.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as when `x` is 0 or when the array `a` contains elements that are all greater than `x`. These edge cases need to be carefully considered to ensure the program works correctly for all inputs.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
1 0
1
```
Expected Output:
```
-1
```
Actual Output:
The program may not produce the correct output because it does not handle the case where `x` is 0 and the array contains elements greater than `x`.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus, it is incorrect.
