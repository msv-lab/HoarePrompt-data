Reasoning:  
The provided functions collectively aim to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the components and their roles:

1. **func_1**: This function reads a line of space-separated integers and returns them as a list. It is used to read the array `a`.

2. **func_2**: This function reads a single integer from the input. It is not used directly in the main logic but could be useful for reading the number of test cases.

3. **func_3**: This function reads a line of space-separated integers and returns them as an iterator. It is used to read the values of `n` and `x`.

4. **func_4**: This function reads a line of input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. It is not used in the provided code.

5. **func_5**: This is the core function that implements the logic to solve the problem. It reads `n` and `x` using `func_3`, reads the array `a` using `func_1`, and then processes the array to find the maximum number of segments that satisfy the given conditions.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_5`:
- **Initialization**: It initializes `t` as an empty list and `ans` as -1.
- **Bitwise Iteration**: It iterates over the bits of `x` from the most significant bit (29th bit) to the least significant bit (0th bit).
- **Bitwise Conditions**:
  - If the current bit of `x` (`u`) and the sum of the current bit of all elements in `a` (`v`) are both 0, it continues to the next bit.
  - If `u` is 0 and `v` is odd, it returns `ans` because it's impossible to form valid segments.
  - If `u` is 0 and `v` is even, it processes the array to form segments and updates `t`.
  - If `u` is 1 and `v` is odd, it continues to the next bit.
  - If `u` is 1 and `v` is even, it counts the number of valid segments and updates `ans`.
- **Final Return**: It returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the modified list `a`.

### Verification:
- The function correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem statement.
- It ensures that the bitwise operations and segment formation are performed according to the rules.
- The function returns -1 if no valid segments can be formed, which aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided functions, especially `func_5`, correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
