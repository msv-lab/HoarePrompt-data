The code `t.append(ai)` adds the value of `ai` to the list `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 27
- `u` is updated to `x >> 27 & 1`
- `v` is updated to `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`
- `a` must be a non-empty list
- `val` is the first element of `a`
- `op` is `val >> 27 & 1`
- `ai` is `ai ^ val`
- The current value of `op` is 0

After executing `t.append(ai)`:
- The value of `ai` is added to the list `t`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 27, `u` is updated to `x >> 27 & 1`, `v` is updated to `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `a` is a non-empty list, `val` is the first element of `a`, `op` is 0, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `t` is now a list containing `ai`.**
