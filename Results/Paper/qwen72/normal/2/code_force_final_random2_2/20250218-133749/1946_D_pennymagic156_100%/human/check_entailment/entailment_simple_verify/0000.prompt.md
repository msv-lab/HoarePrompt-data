You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

    1

    3
    -1

    2
    
Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are a few specific issues:

1. **Handling of Input and Output**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are used to read input, but they do not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem description. The problem specifies that the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent block of input corresponds to a test case. The current implementation does not account for this structure.

2. **Logic for Finding Maximum k**: The logic inside `func_5` is complex and may not correctly handle all edge cases. For example, the program does not correctly handle the case where the array `a` is empty or contains only one element. Additionally, the bitwise operations and the conditions for updating `ans` and `t` are not clearly aligned with the problem's requirements.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as when `x` is 0 or when the array `a` contains elements that are all greater than `x`. These edge cases need to be carefully considered to ensure the program works correctly for all inputs.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
1 0
1
```
Expected Output:
```
-1
```
Actual Output:
The program may not produce the correct output because it does not handle the case where `x` is 0 and the array contains elements greater than `x`.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus, it is incorrect.
