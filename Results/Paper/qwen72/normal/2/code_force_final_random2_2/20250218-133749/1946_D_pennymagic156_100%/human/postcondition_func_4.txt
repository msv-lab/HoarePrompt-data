The function `func_5` processes a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers and a non-negative integer `x`, both less than \(2^{30}\). It iterates through the bits of `x` and modifies `a` based on certain conditions. The function returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the modified list `a`. `ans` is the maximum count of elements in `a` that have a specific bit pattern matching `x` during the iteration, or -1 if no such pattern is found. If no valid pattern is found and the list `a` is empty, the function returns -1.
