Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `x`, and `a`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list `a`, `x` is a non-negative integer less than \(2^{30}\), and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\). The function returns -1 in some cases, the initial value of `ans` in other cases, or the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the list `a`. `ans` is the maximum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop execution, or -1 if no such value was found.**
