Postcondition: ***`i` is 27, `u` is `x >> 27 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `a` is a non-empty list, `val` is the second element of `a`, `op` is `(val >> 27 & 1) ^ (val >> 27 & 1)`, `ai` is 0, and `t` is a list containing 0 and 0 if `op` is 0. Otherwise, `ai` remains `ai ^ val` and `t` remains a list containing 0.***
