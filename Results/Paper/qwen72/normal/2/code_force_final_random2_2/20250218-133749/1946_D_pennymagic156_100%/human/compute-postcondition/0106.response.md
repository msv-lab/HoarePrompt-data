Postcondition: ***`i` remains 28, `u` remains `x >> 28 & 1` (and `u` is not 0), `v` remains `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])` (and `v` is even and non-zero), `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> 28 & 1)` (where `val` is the next element in `a`), `a` remains a list that must have at least one element, `n`, `x`, `t`, `ans` remain unchanged. If the new `op` is 0, `cnt` is 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.***
