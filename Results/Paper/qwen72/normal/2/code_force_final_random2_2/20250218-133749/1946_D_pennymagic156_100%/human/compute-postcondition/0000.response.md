Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_3()`. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and this remains unchanged. The new values of `n` and `x` depend on what `func_3()` returns, but the description of `a` remains valid as it was not altered by the code.
