The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `a`, `val`, and `op` remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `cnt` is increased by 1 if `op` is 0 after the update, the output state reflects this increment.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least three elements, `val` is the third element in `a`, `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `cnt` is increased by 1.**
