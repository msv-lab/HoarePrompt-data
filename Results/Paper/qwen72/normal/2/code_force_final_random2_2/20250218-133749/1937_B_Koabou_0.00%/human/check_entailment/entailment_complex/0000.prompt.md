Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

# Annotated Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. Each test case consists of two binary strings of length n, representing the two rows of the grid.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, and the loop has executed 2 times.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is either the concatenation of the first `x + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from index `x` (if the condition was met), or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]` (if the condition was never met), and `x` is the index where the condition was met (if it was met) or `n - 1` (if it was never met).
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: If the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` is met at any iteration `i` within the range of `0` to `x-1`, then `t` is updated to `x - i + 1` and the loop breaks. If the condition is never met, `t` remains 1, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is either the concatenation of the first `x + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from index `x` (if the condition was met), or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]` (if the condition was never met), `x` is the index where the condition was met (if it was met) or `n - 1` (if it was never met), and `i` is `x - 1` (the last index the loop iterated over).
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is the concatenation of the first x + 1 characters of a[0] and the substring of a[1] starting from index x if the condition was met, or the concatenation of a[0] and the last character of a[1] if the condition was never met)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: t (where t is 1 if the condition was never met, or x - i + 1 if the condition was met at iteration i)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n` from the input. It checks for the first position where the next character in the first string is '1' and the current character in the second string is '0'. If such a position is found, it constructs a new string `s` by concatenating the prefix of the first string up to this position with the suffix of the second string starting from this position. It also calculates a value `t` based on the longest prefix of the first string that matches the corresponding prefix of the new string `s`. Finally, it prints the constructed string `s` and the value `t`. If no such position is found, it prints the first string concatenated with the last character of the second string and sets `t` to 1. The function processes one test case per call.
