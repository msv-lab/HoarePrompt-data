The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly but is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes two binary strings of equal length, where the length of each string (n) satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and the total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. The function processes each test case to determine some output based on the two binary strings.

However, since the specific output is not provided in the problem statement, I will assume a common scenario for such problems: determining if the two binary strings can represent a valid configuration or transformation (e.g., flipping cells in a grid).

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two binary strings of equal length. It returns a result for each test case, typically indicating whether the two strings meet a specific condition or can be transformed into each other through a defined set of operations.**
