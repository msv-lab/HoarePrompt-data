#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. Each test case consists of two binary strings of length n, representing the two rows of the grid.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, and the loop has executed 2 times.

    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is either the concatenation of the first `x + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from index `x` (if the condition was met), or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]` (if the condition was never met), and `x` is the index where the condition was met (if it was met) or `n - 1` (if it was never met).
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: If the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` is met at any iteration `i` within the range of `0` to `x-1`, then `t` is updated to `x - i + 1` and the loop breaks. If the condition is never met, `t` remains 1, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is either the concatenation of the first `x + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from index `x` (if the condition was met), or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]` (if the condition was never met), `x` is the index where the condition was met (if it was met) or `n - 1` (if it was never met), and `i` is `x - 1` (the last index the loop iterated over).
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is the concatenation of the first x + 1 characters of a[0] and the substring of a[1] starting from index x if the condition was met, or the concatenation of a[0] and the last character of a[1] if the condition was never met)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: t (where t is 1 if the condition was never met, or x - i + 1 if the condition was met at iteration i)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n` from the input. It checks for the first position where the next character in the first string is '1' and the current character in the second string is '0'. If such a position is found, it constructs a new string `s` by concatenating the prefix of the first string up to this position with the suffix of the second string starting from this position. It also calculates a value `t` based on the longest prefix of the first string that matches the corresponding prefix of the new string `s`. Finally, it prints the constructed string `s` and the value `t`. If no such position is found, it prints the first string concatenated with the last character of the second string and sets `t` to 1. The function processes one test case per call.
