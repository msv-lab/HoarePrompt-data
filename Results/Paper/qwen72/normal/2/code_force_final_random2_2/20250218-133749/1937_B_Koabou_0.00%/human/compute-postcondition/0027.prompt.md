Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, the loop has executed 2 times, `s` is an empty list, `x` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
        s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
        x = i
        break
else:
    s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
    x = n - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `x` is 0, `i` is 0. If the second character of the first string in `a` is '1' and the first character of the second string in `a` is '0', then `s` is the concatenation of the first `i + 1` characters of the first string in `a` and the remaining characters starting from index `i` of the second string in `a`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `x` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s` remains an empty list if the conditions for breaking out of the loop were not met in the previous iteration. If `a[0][i + 1] == '1'` and `a[1][i] == '0'`, then `x` is set to 1, `i` remains 1, `s` is the concatenation of the first 2 characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from index 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `i` is 2, and `s` remains an empty list if the conditions for breaking out of the loop were not met in the previous iteration. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', then `x` is set to 2, `s` is the concatenation of the first three characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from index 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` remains 0 and `s` remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
