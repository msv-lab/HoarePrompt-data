Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to correctly handle the case where the lexicographically smallest string can be achieved by multiple paths. Specifically, the logic for counting the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
4
0000
0000
```

Expected Output:
```
00000
2
```

Actual Output from the given program:
```
00000
1
```

The program incorrectly outputs `1` for the number of paths, whereas there are actually `2` paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string `00000`. This is because both the top row and the bottom row are identical, and the grasshopper can take either path to achieve the same result.

This indicates that the logic for counting the number of paths is not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
