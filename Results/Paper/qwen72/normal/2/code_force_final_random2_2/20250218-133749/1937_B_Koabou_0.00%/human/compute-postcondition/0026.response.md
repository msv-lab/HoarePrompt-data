Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `i` is 2, and `s` remains an empty list if the conditions for breaking out of the loop were not met in the previous iteration. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', then `x` is set to 2, `s` is the concatenation of the first three characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from index 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` remains 0 and `s` remains an empty list.***
