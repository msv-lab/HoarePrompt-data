Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` is the last input string provided by the user. If any input string `s` contains exactly one '1' character, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. If any input string `s` contains more than one '1' character, `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If no input string `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 0. If no input string `s` contains more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string. After the if-else block, if `a` is 'TRIANGLE', it indicates that at least one input string `s` contains exactly one '1' character. If `a` is 0, it indicates that no input string `s` contains exactly one '1' character.***
