The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE'. If `a` is 'TRIANGLE', then `a` remains 'TRIANGLE'. Otherwise, `a` is 0.**
