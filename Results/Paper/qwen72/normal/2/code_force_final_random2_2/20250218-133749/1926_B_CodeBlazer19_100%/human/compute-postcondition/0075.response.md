Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `s` is the new input string, and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains exactly one '1' character, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.***
