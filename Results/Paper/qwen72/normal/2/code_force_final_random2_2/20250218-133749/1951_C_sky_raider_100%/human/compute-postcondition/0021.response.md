Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t) + s * (l[2] + t)`, `t` is `t + 3 * s`, `k` is `k - 2 * s`**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is decremented by `s` again, so the total decrement is `2 * s`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`, `c`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
