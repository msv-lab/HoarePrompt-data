The value of `t` is incremented by `s`. Given the initial state, `t` was originally defined as `2 * s`. After the increment, `t` becomes `2 * s + s`, which simplifies to `3 * s`.

The initial state remains unchanged for all other variables.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `k` is `k - s - s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` is `3 * s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `c` is `s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t) + s * (l[2] + t)`**.
