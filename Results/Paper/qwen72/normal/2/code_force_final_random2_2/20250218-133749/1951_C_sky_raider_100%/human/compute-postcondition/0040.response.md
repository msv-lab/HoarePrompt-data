Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `k` is `k - s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t)`, `t` is `2 * s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is incremented by `s`, so `t` becomes `2 * s`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `c`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
