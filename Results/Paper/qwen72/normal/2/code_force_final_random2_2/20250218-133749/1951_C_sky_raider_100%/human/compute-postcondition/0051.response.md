The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This will overwrite the current values of `n`, `m`, and `k` with new values provided by the user. The other variables (`i`, `s`, `c`, `t`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Let's break down the changes:

- `n` is reassigned to a new value provided by the user.
- `m` is reassigned to a new value provided by the user.
- `k` is reassigned to a new value provided by the user.

The initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be greater than `n`, but since `n` is being reassigned, this condition no longer applies to the old value of `n`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `n` (where `n` is the new value provided by the user), `n` is a positive integer provided by the user, `m` is an integer provided by the user, `k` is an integer provided by the user, `s` is the minimum of the new `m` and the final value of `k` before each iteration, `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + j * s)` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `t` is `n * s`, `l` remains a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**
