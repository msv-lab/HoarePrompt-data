Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, as well as the list of ticket prices `l`.

2. **Sorting the Prices**: Sorting the list `l` in ascending order is a crucial step. This ensures that the program always considers the cheapest tickets first, which helps in minimizing the total cost. This approach is correct because buying cheaper tickets first will generally result in a lower overall cost.

3. **Initialization**: The variables `t`, `s`, and `c` are initialized to 0, which is appropriate:
   - `t` tracks the total number of tickets purchased so far.
   - `s` is the number of tickets to purchase in the current iteration.
   - `c` accumulates the total cost.

4. **Iterating Over Days**: The loop iterates over the sorted list of ticket prices. For each day:
   - `s` is set to the minimum of `m` (the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a day) and `k` (the remaining number of tickets needed). This ensures that the program does not buy more tickets than allowed per day or more than needed.
   - The cost of buying `s` tickets at the current price plus the cumulative increase `t` is added to `c`. This correctly accounts for the increasing price due to previous purchases.
   - `t` is updated by adding `s` to it, reflecting the increase in ticket prices for subsequent days.
   - `k` is decreased by `s` to reflect the number of tickets still needed.

5. **Output**: After processing all days, the function prints the total cost `c`. This is the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `k` is less than or equal to `m` by purchasing all needed tickets in one go.
   - The function also handles the case where `k` is greater than `m` by spreading the purchases over multiple days.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the number of tickets needed is less than the number of days, ensuring that the minimum cost is achieved by buying tickets on the cheapest days first.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function appears to correctly solve the problem by minimizing the total cost of purchasing `k` tickets.

Final: **True**
