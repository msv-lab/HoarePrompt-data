Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is `0`, `c` is updated to `c + 0 * (l[0] + t) + 0 * (l[1] + t) + ... + 0 * (l[n-1] + t)`, `t` is `0`, `k` is `k - (n-1) * 0`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- `s` is set to `0`.
- Since `s` is `0`, the expression `c + s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t) + ... + s * (l[n-1] + t)` simplifies to `c + 0 * (l[0] + t) + 0 * (l[1] + t) + ... + 0 * (l[n-1] + t)`, which means `c` remains unchanged.
- The expression `k - (n-1) * s` simplifies to `k - (n-1) * 0`, which means `k` remains unchanged.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `t`, and `l`) retain their initial values.
