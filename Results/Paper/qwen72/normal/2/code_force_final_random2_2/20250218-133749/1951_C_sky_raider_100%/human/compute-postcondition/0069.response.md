Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer provided by the user, `k` is `k - s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t) + s * (l[2] + t)`, `t` is `2 * s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is updated to the minimum of `m` and `k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 2.
- The value of `m` remains an integer provided by the user.
- The value of `k` remains `k - s`.
- The value of `s` remains the minimum of `m` and `k`.
- The value of `c` is updated to include the additional term `s * (l[i] + t)`, which is `s * (l[2] + t)` since `i` is 2.
- The value of `t` remains `2 * s`.
- The value of `l` remains a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
- The value of `s` remains the minimum of `m` and `k`.
