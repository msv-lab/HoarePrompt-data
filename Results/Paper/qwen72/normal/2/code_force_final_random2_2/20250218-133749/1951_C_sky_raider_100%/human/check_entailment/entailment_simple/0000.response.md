Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the minimum spending required to purchase exactly \( k \) tickets over \( n \) days, given the constraints on daily ticket purchases and price increases. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), and the list of ticket prices \( l \).
3. **Sorting Prices**: The list \( l \) is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that the program always considers the cheapest available tickets first, which is crucial for minimizing the total cost.
4. **Initialization**: The variables \( t \), \( s \), and \( c \) are initialized to 0. \( t \) keeps track of the total number of tickets bought so far, \( s \) is the number of tickets to buy in the current iteration, and \( c \) is the cumulative cost.
5. **Iterating Over Days**: The program iterates over the sorted list of prices. In each iteration:
   - It calculates \( s \) as the minimum of \( m \) (the maximum tickets that can be bought in a day) and \( k \) (the remaining tickets to be bought).
   - It updates the total cost \( c \) by adding \( s \times (l[i] + t) \), where \( l[i] \) is the current price and \( t \) is the total number of tickets bought so far.
   - It increments \( t \) by \( s \) to account for the tickets bought in this iteration.
   - It decrements \( k \) by \( s \) to update the remaining tickets to be bought.
6. **Output**: After processing all days, the program prints the total cost \( c \).

The logic of the program is sound and aligns with the problem requirements. The sorting step ensures that the program always buys the cheapest available tickets first, and the price increase mechanism is correctly handled by adding \( t \) to the current price.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
