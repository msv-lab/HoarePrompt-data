Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l.sort()
    t = 0
    s = 0
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s = min(m, k)
        c += s * (l[i] + t)
        t += s
        k -= s
    print(int(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains a positive integer, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k` (but may be 0 if `k` has been fully decremented), `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t) + ... + s * (l[n-1] + t)`, `t` is `t + n * s`, and `k` is `k - (n-1) * s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains a positive integer, `m` remains an integer, `k` is `k - n * s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and the final value of `k` before each iteration, `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + j * s)` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `t` is `n * s`, and `l` remains a sorted list of integers provided by the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains the same as provided by the user, `m` remains the same as provided by the user, `k` is `k - n * s`, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` initially, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` after each iteration, `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `t` is `n * s`, and `l` remains the same sorted list of integers provided by the user.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
