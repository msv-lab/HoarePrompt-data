The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `k` is `k - s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * (l[0] + t)`, `t` is `s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**
