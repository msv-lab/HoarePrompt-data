The value of `k` is decreased by `s`. Since `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `k` is now `k - s`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t)`, `t` is `t + 2 * s`, `k` is `k - s`.**
