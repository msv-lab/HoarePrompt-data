The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `l`. This operation updates the value of `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n` (where `n` is the new value provided by the user)
- `n` is a positive integer provided by the user
- `m` is an integer provided by the user
- `k` is an integer provided by the user
- `s` is the minimum of the new `m` and the final value of `k` before each iteration
- `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + j * s)` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`
- `t` is `n * s`
- `l` remains a sorted list of integers provided by the user

After executing the code snippet:
- `l` is now a list of integers provided by the user, replacing the previous sorted list.

The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n` (where `n` is the new value provided by the user), `n` is a positive integer provided by the user, `m` is an integer provided by the user, `k` is an integer provided by the user, `s` is the minimum of the new `m` and the final value of `k` before each iteration, `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + j * s)` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `t` is `n * s`, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
