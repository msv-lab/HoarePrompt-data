Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[0] + t)`, `t` is `t + s`, `k` is `k - s`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is decreased by `s`, where `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`, `c`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state, except for the updates already mentioned in the initial state.
