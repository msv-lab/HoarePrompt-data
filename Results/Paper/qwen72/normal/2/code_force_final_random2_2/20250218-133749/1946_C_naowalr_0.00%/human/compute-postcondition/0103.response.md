Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` now contains `b` and `adj[b]` now contains `a` and `a`, `z` is 2, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are the next pair of integers read from the input, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L`, `adj[a]` now also contains `b`, and `adj[b]` now also contains `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `adj[b].append(a)` adds `a` to the list `adj[b]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The updated state reflects that both `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` now contain each other, maintaining the bidirectional relationship between `a` and `b` in the adjacency list.
