Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` now contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`, `z` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `adj[a]` now includes `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `adj[a].append(b)` adds the integer `b` to the list `adj[a]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `z`, `i`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
- The structure of `adj` remains a list of `n + 1` lists, but now `adj[a]` contains the additional element `b`.
- The condition that `adj[b]` contains `[a]` is still valid, but `adj[a]` now also contains `b`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `z`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain as they were in the initial state.
