Postcondition: ***`t` remains a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` remains an integer greater than 1 read from standard input, `k` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 read from standard input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` during the loop, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` during the loop, `z` remains 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `x` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. Otherwise, `R` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`.***
