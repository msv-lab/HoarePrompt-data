Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the corresponding connected nodes as specified by the input pairs, `z` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L`.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `L` to 1. This updates the value of `L` from its previous state to 1. Since `R` is defined as `L + 1`, `R` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
