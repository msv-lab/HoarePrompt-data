The code snippet `adj[b].append(a)` adds the integer `a` to the list `adj[b]`. This impacts the structure of the adjacency list `adj`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `n` is an integer greater than 2
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` now contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`
- `z` is 0
- `i` is 2
- `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input
- `adj[a]` now includes `b`
- `adj[b]` now includes `a`
- `a` and `b` are updated to the new integers read from standard input
- `adj[a]` now includes an additional element `b`

After executing the code snippet:
- `adj[b]` now includes an additional element `a`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` now contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a]`, `z` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `adj[a]` now includes `b`, `adj[b]` now includes `a` and `a`.**
