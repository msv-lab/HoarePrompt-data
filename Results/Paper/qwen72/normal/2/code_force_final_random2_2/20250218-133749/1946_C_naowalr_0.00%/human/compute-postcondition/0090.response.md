The code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. This means the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the new input.

Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` during the loop, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` during the loop, `z` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, `R` is `L + 1`, and `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L`.**
