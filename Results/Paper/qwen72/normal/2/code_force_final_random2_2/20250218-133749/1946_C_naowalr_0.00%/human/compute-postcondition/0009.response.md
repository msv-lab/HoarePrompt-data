Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` now contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`, `z` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input.**

Explanation:
- The code reads two integers `a` and `b` from standard input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `z`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The new values of `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input.
