Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` now contains `b` and `adj[b]` now contains `a`, `z` is 2, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are the next pair of integers read from the input, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))` reads the next line of input and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to `a` and `b`.
- The values of `a` and `b` are now the next pair of integers read from the input.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `z`, `i`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values or conditions.
