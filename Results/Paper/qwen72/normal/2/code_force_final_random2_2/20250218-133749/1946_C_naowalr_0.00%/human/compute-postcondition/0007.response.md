Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` now contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`, `z` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input.**

Explanation:
- The code `adj[b].append(a)` adds the integer `a` to the list `adj[b]`.
- The initial state specifies that `adj[a]` contains `[b]`, and after executing the code, `adj[b]` now also contains `[a]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `z`, `i`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
