Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1 read from standard input, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 read from standard input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `z` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `L` is the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts <= k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover < L`) holds, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `adj` to be a list of `n + 1` empty lists. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
