Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `ap` must be greater than 1, `k` is 1, `bxsfory` is `math.ceil(y / 2)`, `bxsfory1` is undefined.**

Explanation: The variable `bxsfory` is now assigned the value of `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which means it holds the smallest integer greater than or equal to half of `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
