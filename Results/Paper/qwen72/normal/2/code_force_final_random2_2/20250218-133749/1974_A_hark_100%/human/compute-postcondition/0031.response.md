The only variable in the loop head is `k` and the condition for the loop to execute is that `k` must be less than `ap`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `ap` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `ap` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `ap` must be greater than 2, `k` is 2, `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` are defined based on the conditions given in the problem statement.**
