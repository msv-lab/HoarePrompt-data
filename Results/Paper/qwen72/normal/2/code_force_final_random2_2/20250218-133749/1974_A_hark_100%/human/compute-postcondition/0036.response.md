Let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
- `y` is an integer read from input.
- `ap` must be greater than 2.
- `k` is 2.
- `bxsfory` is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
- `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate `bxsfory`:**
   - `bxsfory` is defined as `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - This means `bxsfory` is the ceiling of half of `y`.

2. **Update `x`:**
   - `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
   - Let's denote the initial value of `x` as `x_initial`.
   - After the update, `x` becomes `x_initial - math.ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`.

3. **Calculate `bxsfory1`:**
   - `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0.
   - Otherwise, `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
   - We need to check the value of `x` after the update to determine `bxsfory1`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume some values for `x_initial` and `y` to illustrate the process:

- Suppose `x_initial = 100` and `y = 10`.
- Calculate `bxsfory`:
  - `bxsfory = math.ceil(10 / 2) = math.ceil(5) = 5`.
- Update `x`:
  - `x = 100 - 5 * 15 + 10 * 4 = 100 - 75 + 40 = 65`.
- Calculate `bxsfory1`:
  - Since `x = 65` is greater than 0, `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(65 / 15) = math.ceil(4.333) = 5`.

### Final Calculation:
- The print statement is `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`.
- In our example, `bxsfory1 = 5` and `bxsfory = 5`.
- Therefore, `bxsfory1 + bxsfory = 5 + 5 = 10`.

### General Case:
- The exact value of `bxsfory1 + bxsfory` depends on the initial values of `x` and `y`.
- However, the formula for `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory` is clear:
  - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`.
  - `bxsfory1 = 0` if `x <= 0`, otherwise `bxsfory1 = math.ceil((x_initial - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4) / 15)`.

### Final Output:
Output: **bxsfory1 + bxsfory (where bxsfory1 is 0 if x <= 0, otherwise math.ceil((x_initial - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4) / 15), and bxsfory is math.ceil(y / 2))**
