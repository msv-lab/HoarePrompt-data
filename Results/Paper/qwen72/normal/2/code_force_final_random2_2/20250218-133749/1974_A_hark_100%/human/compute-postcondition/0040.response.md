Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `ap` must be greater than 2, `k` is 2, and `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` are defined based on the conditions given in the problem statement. If `x` > 0 and `y` == 0, the specific conditions for `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` are applied as defined. Otherwise, the conditions for `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` are applied based on the else part of the problem statement.***
