Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `ap` is 0, `k` is `ap` (which is 0). For each iteration, if `x > 0` and `y > 0`, `x` was updated to `x - (ceiling(y / 2) * 15) + (y * 4)` and `y` remained greater than 0. The value of `bxsfory` was `math.ceil(y / 2)`, and `bxsfory1` was 0 if the new `x` was less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` was `math.ceil(new_x / 15)`. If `x` == 0 and `y` > 0, the value printed was `math.ceil(y / 2)`. If `x` > 0 and `y` == 0, the value printed was `math.ceil(x / 15)`. In all other cases, the value printed was 0. After all iterations, `ap` is 0, and `k` has reached the final value of `ap` (which is 0).**
