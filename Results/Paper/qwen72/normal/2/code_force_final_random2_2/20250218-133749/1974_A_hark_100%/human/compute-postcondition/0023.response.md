Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, `y` is an integer read from input, `ap` must be greater than 1, `k` is 1, `bxsfory` is `math.ceil(y / 2)`, `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15)`**.

Explanation:
- `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
- `y` is an integer read from input.
- `ap` must still be greater than 1.
- `k` remains 1.
- `bxsfory` is calculated as `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
- `bxsfory1` is set to 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0; otherwise, it is set to `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
