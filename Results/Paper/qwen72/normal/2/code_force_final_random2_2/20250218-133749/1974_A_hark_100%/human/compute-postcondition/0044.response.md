The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. However, based on the context provided, it seems to operate under the assumption that there are some predefined or externally set values for `t`, `x`, and `y`, where `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and `x` and `y` are integers within the range 0 to 99. The function's output is not specified in the given information, so we cannot determine what it returns without additional context.

However, if we assume that the function is designed to process these values in some way (since they are mentioned as part of the parameter constraints), the most accurate description of the function's functionality based on the provided information would be:

Functionality: **The function processes predefined or externally set values for `t`, `x`, and `y`, where `t` is an integer in the range 1 to 10^4, and `x` and `y` are integers in the range 0 to 99. The specific output or behavior of the function is not specified.**
