Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `x` and `y` are integers read from input.
- `ap` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is greater than 0.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print(math.ceil(y / 2))
```

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Value of `y`**: According to the precondition, `y` is an integer greater than 0.
2. **Expression `y / 2`**: This divides `y` by 2, resulting in a floating-point number.
3. **Function `math.ceil(y / 2)`**: This function rounds up the result of `y / 2` to the nearest integer.

Since `y` is greater than 0, the value of `math.ceil(y / 2)` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

Therefore, the output will be the ceiling of `y / 2`.

Output: **math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is an integer greater than 0)**
