Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `ap` must be greater than 2, `k` is 2, and `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` are defined based on the conditions given in the problem statement. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is `math.ceil(y / 2)`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15)`. If `x == 0` and `y > 0`, the specific conditions for `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` are applied as defined. If `x > 0` and `y == 0`, the specific conditions for `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` are applied as defined. Otherwise, the conditions for `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` are applied based on the else part of the problem statement.***
