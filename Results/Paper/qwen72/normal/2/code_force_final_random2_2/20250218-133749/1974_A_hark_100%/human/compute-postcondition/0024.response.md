Let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
- `y` is an integer read from input.
- `ap` must be greater than 1.
- `k` is 1.
- `bxsfory` is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
- `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `bxsfory`:**
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - This means `bxsfory` is the ceiling of half of `y`.

2. **Update `x`:**
   - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
   - This updates `x` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and `bxsfory`.

3. **Calculate `bxsfory1`:**
   - If `x <= 0`, then `bxsfory1 = 0`.
   - Otherwise, `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(x / 15)`.

4. **Print the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`:**
   - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume some example values to illustrate the process:

- Suppose `y = 7`.
  - `bxsfory = math.ceil(7 / 2) = math.ceil(3.5) = 4`.
- Suppose `x = 100` initially.
  - `x = 100 - 4 * 15 + 7 * 4 = 100 - 60 + 28 = 68`.
- Now, calculate `bxsfory1`:
  - Since `x = 68` (which is greater than 0), `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(68 / 15) = math.ceil(4.5333) = 5`.
- Finally, print the sum:
  - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory) = print(5 + 4) = print(9)`.

### General Case:
- `bxsfory` is always a positive integer because it is the ceiling of half of `y`.
- `bxsfory1` depends on the updated value of `x` after the calculation `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
- If `x` becomes less than or equal to 0 after the update, `bxsfory1` will be 0.
- Otherwise, `bxsfory1` will be a positive integer.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`. The exact value depends on the initial values of `x` and `y`.

Output: **bxsfory1 + bxsfory (where bxsfory1 is 0 if x <= 0, otherwise math.ceil(x / 15), and bxsfory is math.ceil(y / 2))**
