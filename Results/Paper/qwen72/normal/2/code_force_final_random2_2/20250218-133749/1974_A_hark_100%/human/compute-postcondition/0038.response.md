To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the statement itself:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `x` and `y` are integers read from input.
- `ap` must be greater than 2.
- `k` is 2.
- `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` are defined based on the conditions given in the problem statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(math.ceil(x / 15))
```

### Analysis:
- The `math.ceil` function is used to round up the result of the division `x / 15` to the nearest integer.
- The value of `x` is an integer read from input, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we need to consider the general behavior of the `math.ceil` function.

### Calculation:
- The expression `x / 15` will yield a floating-point number.
- `math.ceil(x / 15)` will round this floating-point number up to the nearest integer.

### Output:
Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value that will be printed. However, we can describe the output in terms of `x`.

Output: **math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is the integer read from input)**

This means the output will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to the result of `x / 15`.
