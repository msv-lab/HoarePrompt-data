Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and then reads each constraint.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - **Type 1 Constraints (k ≥ x)**: The program keeps track of the maximum value of `x` seen so far using `bx`.
   - **Type 2 Constraints (k ≤ x)**: The program keeps track of the minimum value of `x` seen so far using `ax`.
   - **Type 3 Constraints (k ≠ x)**: The program stores these values in a set `cx`.

3. **Range Calculation**:
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If this is true, it means there is no integer `k` that can satisfy both the minimum and maximum constraints, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - If `bx` is less than `ax`, the program calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the number of values in `cx` that fall within this range. This is done by iterating over `cx` and counting how many values are between `bx` and `ax`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, one per line, which matches the expected output format.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when there are no type 1 or type 2 constraints (though the problem guarantees at least one of each).
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the range `[bx, ax]` is empty, resulting in `0` as the output.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
