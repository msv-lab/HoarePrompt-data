The code snippet `r.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the end of the list `r`. The list `r` initially contains `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`. After appending `0`, the list `r` will contain `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `tmp`, `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]`, `n` is 0, `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `bx` is the maximum value encountered from the inputs with `a` being 1, `ax` is the minimum value encountered from the inputs with `a` being 2 (or 1000000007 if no such input was given), `cx` is a set containing all unique values from the inputs with `a` being 3, and `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`.**
