The value of `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and the current value of `ax`. Given that `ax` is initially 1000000007 and `x` is an input integer, the new value of `ax` will be the smaller of these two values. Since `x` is an input integer, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `ax` will now be the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is 2, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is not equal to 1.**
