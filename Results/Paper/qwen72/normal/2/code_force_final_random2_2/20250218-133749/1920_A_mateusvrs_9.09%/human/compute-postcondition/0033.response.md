Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 2, otherwise it remains 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 1, otherwise it remains -1, and `cx` is a set containing all unique input integers `x` when `a` is 3.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`r`**: Remains an empty list as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Decrements by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0, indicating the loop has completed all iterations.
- **`ax`**: Initially set to 1000000007, it is updated to the minimum value of all input integers `x` when `a` is 2. If no such `a` is 2, it remains 1000000007.
- **`bx`**: Initially set to -1, it is updated to the maximum value of all input integers `x` when `a` is 1. If no such `a` is 1, it remains -1.
- **`cx`**: Initially an empty set, it accumulates all unique input integers `x` when `a` is 3. If no such `a` is 3, it remains an empty set.
