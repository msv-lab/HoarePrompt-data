The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be initialized to a specific value before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1**
