Reasoning:  
The program correctly handles the input and processes the constraints to determine the number of valid integers \( k \) that satisfy all the given constraints. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large value (1,000,000,000 + 7) and `bx` to a very small value (-1).
   - It iterates through each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` to the maximum of the current `x` and `bx`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` to the minimum of the current `x` and `ax`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Checking Valid Range:**
   - If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, it means there is no valid integer \( k \) that satisfies both the lower and upper bounds, so it appends 0 to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the number of excluded integers from the set `cx` that fall within this range.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for all test cases, one per line.

The program correctly implements the logic to handle the constraints and calculate the number of valid integers \( k \) for each test case. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
