Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is an input integer. If `a` is 1, `bx` is max(x, -1). If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `cx` remains an empty set. Otherwise, `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing the input integer `x`, and `a` is not equal to 1 or 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the first input integer, and `x` is the second input integer. If `a` is 1, `bx` is set to max(x, -1). If `a` is 2, `ax` is set to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is set to max(x, -1), and `cx` remains an empty set. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `ax` is set to 1000000007, `bx` is set to max(x, 1000000007), and `cx` is a set containing the input integer `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer. If `a` == 1, `bx` is set to `x`, `ax` is not yet defined, and `cx` remains an empty set. If `a` == 2, `ax` is set to `x`, `bx` is not yet defined, and `cx` remains an empty set. For any other value of `a`, `ax` is not yet defined, `bx` is not yet defined, and `cx` contains the value `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
