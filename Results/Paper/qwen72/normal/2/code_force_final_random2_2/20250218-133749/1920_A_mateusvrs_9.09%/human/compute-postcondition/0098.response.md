The code snippet `r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)` appends a new element to the list `r`. The new element is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499
- `r` is a list containing one element which is `1000000008`
- `n` is 0
- `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`
- `a` and `x` are no longer relevant
- `bx` is the maximum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 1
- `ax` is the minimum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 2
- `cx` is a set containing all unique values encountered from the inputs where `a` was 3
- `bx` is less than `ax`

After executing the code:
- The list `r` now contains two elements: `1000000008` and `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`, `n` is 0, `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `a` and `x` are no longer relevant, `bx` is the maximum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 2, `cx` is a set containing all unique values encountered from the inputs where `a` was 3, and `bx` is less than `ax`.**
