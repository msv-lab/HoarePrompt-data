The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to the minimum of `x` and the current value of `ax`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498
- `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`
- `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n - 1`
- `tmp` is 0
- `ax` is 1000000007
- `a` and `x` are updated to the integers provided by the user input
- `bx` is -1 if `a` is not 1 or 2, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of the original `x` and the original `bx`
- `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `{x}`

After executing the code snippet:

- `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and `1000000007`.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. If `x` is less than or equal to 1000000007, then `ax` will be set to `x`.
2. If `x` is greater than 1000000007, then `ax` will remain 1000000007.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n - 1`, `tmp` is 0, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `a` and `x` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `bx` is -1 if `a` is not 1 or 2, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of the original `x` and the original `bx`, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `{x}`.**
