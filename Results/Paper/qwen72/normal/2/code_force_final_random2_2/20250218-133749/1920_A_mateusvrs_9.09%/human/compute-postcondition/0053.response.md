The code snippet `cx = set()` reassigns the variable `cx` to an empty set. This overrides the previous value of `cx`, which was a set containing all unique input integers `x` when `a` is 3.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is either a list containing [0] if `bx` ≥ `ax`, or a list containing one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` if `bx` < `ax`. `n` is an input integer, `ax` is the minimum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 2, otherwise it remains 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 1, otherwise it remains -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `bx` < `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.**
