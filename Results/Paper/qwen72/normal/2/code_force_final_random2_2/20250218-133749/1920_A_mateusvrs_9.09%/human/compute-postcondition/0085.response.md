Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list containing one element which is `1000000008`, `n` is 0 (indicating the loop has completed its iterations), `tmp` is 0, `a` and `x` are no longer relevant as they are input values for each iteration, `bx` is the maximum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 2, `cx` is a set containing all unique values encountered from the inputs where `a` was 3, and `bx` is less than `ax`.**
