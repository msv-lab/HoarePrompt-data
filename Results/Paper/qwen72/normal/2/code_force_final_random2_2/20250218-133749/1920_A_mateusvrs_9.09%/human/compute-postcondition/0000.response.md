The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases, and according to the initial state, it must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and `x` is an integer where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, ensuring a finite solution. No two constraints are the same within a test case.**
