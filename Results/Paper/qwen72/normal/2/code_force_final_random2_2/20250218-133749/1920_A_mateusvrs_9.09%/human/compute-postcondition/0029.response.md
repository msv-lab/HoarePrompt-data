Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the initial value of `ax` (which is undefined), `bx` is not yet defined, and `cx` remains an empty set.**

Explanation:
- The code `ax = min(x, ax)` assigns to `ax` the minimum value between `x` and the current value of `ax`.
- Since `ax` is not yet defined, the initial value of `ax` is considered undefined.
- Therefore, `ax` is now the minimum of `x` and an undefined value, which means `ax` is simply `x`.
- All other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `a`, `x`, `bx`, and `cx`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
