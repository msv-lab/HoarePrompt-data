Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list containing one element which is `1000000008`, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `tmp` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1` if `a` is 1, otherwise the maximum of `x` and `-1`, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise a set containing the element `x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and its current value (`-1` if `a` is 1, otherwise `-1`).
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
