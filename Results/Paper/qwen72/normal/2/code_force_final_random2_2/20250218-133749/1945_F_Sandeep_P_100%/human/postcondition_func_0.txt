The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `fillvalue` and returns a `decorating_function` without modifying it. The purpose of the function is to serve as a decorator that makes a `repr` function return the specified `fillvalue` for recursive calls. After the function concludes, the `decorating_function` is returned in its original form, and the `fillvalue` parameter is not directly affected or modified.
