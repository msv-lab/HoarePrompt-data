To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variables `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`.
   - These variables are derived from the `zip` function applied to slices of the list `a`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The `zip` function will create tuples of elements from the lists `a`, `a[1:]`, `a[2:]`, and `a[3:]`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the length of the shortest list in the `zip` function must be at least 1.

3. **Analyze the List `a`:**
   - The list `a` is given as `[-1000000000.0, c, d, 2000000000.0]`.
   - The slices of `a` are:
     - `a[1:]` = `[c, d, 2000000000.0]`
     - `a[2:]` = `[d, 2000000000.0]`
     - `a[3:]` = `[2000000000.0]`

4. **Determine the Lengths of the Slices:**
   - `a` has 4 elements.
   - `a[1:]` has 3 elements.
   - `a[2:]` has 2 elements.
   - `a[3:]` has 1 element.

5. **Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The shortest list in the `zip` function is `a[3:]`, which has 1 element.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute at least once if `a` has at least 4 elements.

6. **Adjust the State:**
   - The list `a` already has 4 elements, so no adjustment is needed for the length of `a`.
   - The initial values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be the first elements of the respective slices:
     - `w` is `-1000000000.0`
     - `x` is `c`
     - `y` is `d`
     - `z` is `2000000000.0`

### Final State:
The loop will execute at least once with the given list `a`. The initial values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are determined by the first elements of the slices of `a`.

State: **`a` is `[-1000000000.0, c, d, 2000000000.0]`, `v` is `2000000000.0`, `b` is `[0, 0]`, `u` is `0`, `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `r()`, `t` is `False`, `w` is `-1000000000.0`, `x` is `c`, `y` is `d`, `z` is `2000000000.0`**
