Output State: **`a` is a list with at least 6 elements starting with `[-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0]`, `v` is `y - x`, `b` is extended by the elements `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w` is `True`, otherwise `b[-2] + 1`, and `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y` is `True`, otherwise `b[-1] + 1`, `(w, x, y, z)` is `(a[1], a[2], a[3], a[4])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `v` is updated to `y - x`.
- The conditions for extending `b` are based on the value of `v` and the differences between `x - w` and `z - y`.
- Since the specific values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are not provided, the conditions `v > x - w` and `v > z - y` cannot be evaluated to a boolean value. Therefore, the exact elements added to `b` depend on these conditions.
- The initial state of `a` remains unchanged.
- The tuple `(w, x, y, z)` is still `(a[1], a[2], a[3], a[4])`.
