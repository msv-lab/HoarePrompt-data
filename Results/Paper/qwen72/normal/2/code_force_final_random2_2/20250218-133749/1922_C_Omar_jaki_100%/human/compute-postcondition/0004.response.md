The lambda function `r` is designed to read space-separated integers from input. When `r()` is called, it reads a line of input and returns a list of integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but now `t` is `t - 1`.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9.
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.
- `queries` is a list of `m` pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
- The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
- A lambda function `r` is defined to read space-separated integers from input.

When `r()` is called, it reads a line of input and returns a list of integers. This call does not modify any of the existing variables in the initial state, but it does provide a new list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but now `t` is `t - 1`; for each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and `queries` is a list of `m` pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. A new list of integers has been read from input.**
