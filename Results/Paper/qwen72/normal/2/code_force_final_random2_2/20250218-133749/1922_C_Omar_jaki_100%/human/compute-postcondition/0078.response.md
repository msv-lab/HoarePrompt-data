Output State: **The list `a` has 4 elements, `w` is `-1000000000.0`, `z` is `2000000000.0`, `u` is `0`, `c` and `d` are the final values returned by `r()`, `x` is the final value of `c`, `y` is the final value of `d`, `v` is `d - c` (with the final values of `d` and `c`), `b` is extended by the total number of new elements added during all iterations, each pair being `b[-2] + (d - c)` (using the values of `d` and `c` from each iteration). If the final `c` is less than the final `d`, `c` remains less than `d`. If the final `c` is greater than or equal to the final `d`, `c` remains greater than or equal to `d`. `t` is now `False`.**
