Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list with at least 7 elements:
  - The first element is `-1000000000.0`.
  - The next five elements are returned by `r()`.
  - The last element is `2000000000.0`.
- `w` is the fourth element of `a`.
- `x` is the fifth element of `a`.
- `y` is the sixth element of `a`.
- `z` is the seventh element of `a`.
- `u` is a falsy value (initially truthy, but decremented by 1).
- `c` is a new value returned by `r()`.
- `d` is a new value returned by `r()`.
- `v` is `y - x`.
- `b` is `[0, 0, v, 1, 2*v, 2, 3*v, 2 + v, 4*v, 2 + 2*v]`.
- `t` is `False`.
- `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**:
   - `a = [-1000000000.0, r(), r(), r(), r(), r(), 2000000000.0]`
   - `w = a[3]` (fourth element)
   - `x = a[4]` (fifth element)
   - `y = a[5]` (sixth element)
   - `z = a[6]` (seventh element)

2. **Variable `v`**:
   - `v = y - x`

3. **List `b`**:
   - `b = [0, 0, v, 1, 2*v, 2, 3*v, 2 + v, 4*v, 2 + 2*v]`

4. **Variables `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are new values returned by `r()`, and `c >= d`.

5. **Expression `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]`**:
   - We need to determine the indices `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` and then subtract the corresponding elements in `b`.

### Possible Values:
- Since `c` and `d` are returned by `r()`, they are integers.
- The valid indices for `b` are from 0 to 9.
- Therefore, `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` must be within the range 0 to 9.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `c = 3` and `d = 2` (since `c >= d`):
  - `c * 2 - 1 = 3 * 2 - 1 = 5`
  - `d * 2 - 1 = 2 * 2 - 1 = 3`
  - `b[5] = 2`
  - `b[3] = 1`
  - `b[5] - b[3] = 2 - 1 = 1`

### General Case:
- For any valid `c` and `d` where `c >= d`:
  - `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]` will be elements from the list `b`.
  - The difference `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` will be computed based on the values of `v` and the specific indices.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `c` and `d` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `b` and the value of `v`.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where c and d are integers such that c >= d, and b is the list [0, 0, v, 1, 2*v, 2, 3*v, 2 + v, 4*v, 2 + 2*v])**
