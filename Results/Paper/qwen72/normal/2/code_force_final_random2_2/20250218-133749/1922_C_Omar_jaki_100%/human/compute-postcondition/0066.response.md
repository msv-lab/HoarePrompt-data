To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list with 4 elements.
- `w` is `-1000000000.0`.
- `z` is `2000000000.0`.
- `u` is `False`.
- `c` and `d` are updated to the new values returned by `r()`.
- `x` is the new value of `c`.
- `y` is the new value of `d`.
- `v` is `d - c` (with the new values of `d` and `c`).
- `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + (d - c)` (using the new values of `d` and `c`).
- If the new `c` is less than the new `d`, `c` remains less than `d`.
- If the new `c` is greater than or equal to the new `d`, `c` remains greater than or equal to `d`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Values of `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are updated to the new values returned by `r()`. Let's assume `r()` returns `(new_c, new_d)`.
   - `x` is set to `new_c`.
   - `y` is set to `new_d`.
   - `v` is calculated as `new_d - new_c`.

2. **Extending List `b`**:
   - `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + (new_d - new_c)`.
   - This means the last two elements of `b` are added to the list, where the second-to-last element is increased by `new_d - new_c`.

3. **Condition on `c` and `d`**:
   - If `new_c < new_d`, then `c` remains less than `d`.
   - If `new_c >= new_d`, then `c` remains greater than or equal to `d`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])`.
   - We need to determine the values of `b[(d - 1) * 2]` and `b[(c - 1) * 2]`.

### Determining the Values:
- Let's assume `b` initially has some values, say `[b1, b2, b3, b4]`.
- After extending `b` by two new elements, `b` becomes `[b1, b2, b3, b4, b3 + (new_d - new_c), b4 + (new_d - new_c)]`.

- **Index Calculation**:
  - `b[(d - 1) * 2]` will access the element at index `(new_d - 1) * 2`.
  - `b[(c - 1) * 2]` will access the element at index `(new_c - 1) * 2`.

- **Possible Scenarios**:
  - If `new_d = 1` and `new_c = 1`, both indices will be 0, and the result will be `b[0] - b[0] = 0`.
  - If `new_d = 2` and `new_c = 1`, the indices will be 2 and 0, and the result will be `b[2] - b[0]`.
  - If `new_d = 3` and `new_c = 1`, the indices will be 4 and 0, and the result will be `b[4] - b[0]`.
  - If `new_d = 3` and `new_c = 2`, the indices will be 4 and 2, and the result will be `b[4] - b[2]`.

### Final Output:
Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for `b`, `new_c`, and `new_d`, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where `b` is the list after being extended, `c` and `d` are the new values returned by `r()`)**
