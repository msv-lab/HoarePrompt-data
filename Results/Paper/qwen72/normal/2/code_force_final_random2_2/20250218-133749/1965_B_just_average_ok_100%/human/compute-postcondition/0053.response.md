To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head involves the variable `i` and the length of `nums`.

- The variable `i` is initialized to 20 in the state before the loop, but in the loop head, `i` is used as the loop variable starting from 0 (as per the `range(len(nums))`).
- The length of `nums` is 21, which means the loop will iterate from 0 to 20 (inclusive).

For the loop to execute, `i` should start from 0, and the length of `nums` should be at least 1. Given that the length of `nums` is already 21, the loop will execute without needing to adjust the length of `nums`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` starts from 0, and the other variables (`idx`, `n`, and `k`) remain as they are since they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` is -1, `i` is 0, the length of `nums` is 21, and the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the input values**
