### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For every integer `v` in the range `[1, n]` except `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - The program starts by generating powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\) (i.e., `1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 1048576`).
   - It then finds the largest power of 2 less than `k` and removes it from the list.
   - It appends three additional numbers: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the modified list and the list itself.

3. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **Powers of 2:** The initial list `nums` contains powers of 2, which ensures that any subset sum of these numbers is unique and can represent any number in the range `[1, 2^21 - 1]` using binary representation.
   - **Removing a Power of 2:** By removing the largest power of 2 less than `k`, the program ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k`. This is because the removed number is crucial for forming the sum `k` when combined with other smaller powers of 2.
   - **Adding Additional Numbers:**
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed, as the removed power of 2 is necessary to form this sum.
     - `k + 1`: This number ensures that the sum `k + 1` can be formed, which is necessary for the range `[1, n]`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This number ensures that the sum `k + nums[idx] + 1` can be formed, which helps in covering the range `[1, n]` more effectively.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by removing a critical element.
   - The added elements help cover the required range `[1, n]` while avoiding the sum `k`.
   - The size of the sequence is at most 25, which meets the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by ensuring that no subsequence sums to `k` while covering all other required sums in the range `[1, n]`.

Correctness: **True**
