The value `k + nums[idx] + 1` is appended to the list `nums`. The value of `idx` remains unchanged. The new element added to `nums` is the sum of `k`, the element at index `idx` in `nums`, and 1.

Output State: **`nums` is the original list with the new elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` appended to it, and `idx` remains the same as it was before the code execution (either `i - 1` or -1).**
