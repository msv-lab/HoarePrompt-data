Output State: **`_` is a placeholder for the loop, `n` and `k` are positive integers from the input, `nums` is a list containing the powers of 2 from 1 to 1048576 (i.e., \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `idx` is -1.** 

The variable `idx` is initialized to -1, while the other variables (`_`, `n`, `k`, and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
