Output State: **`nums` is now a list containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` remains the same as it was before the code execution (either `i - 1` or -1), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]` reassigns `nums` to a new list containing the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
- The value of `idx` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the given code.
- The value of `_` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the given code.
