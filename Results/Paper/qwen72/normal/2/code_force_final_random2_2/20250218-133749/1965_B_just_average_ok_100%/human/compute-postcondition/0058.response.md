The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `len(nums)` must be greater than `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and the length of `nums` is 21. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 1, and the length of `nums` must still be 21.

State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` is -1, `i` is 1, the length of `nums` is 21, and the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the input values.**
