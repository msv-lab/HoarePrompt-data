To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(nums))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `nums` list step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) excluding \(2^{\text{idx}}\).
   - After the powers of 2, the list contains the values \(k - \text{nums}[\text{idx}]\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + \text{nums}[\text{idx}] + 1\).
   - `idx` is the largest index such that `nums[idx] <= k`.
   - `i` is the index where `nums[i] > k` or 20 if no such element exists.
   - The length of `nums` is 23.
   - The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the input values.

2. **Constructing the List `nums`:**
   - The list starts with powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), but one power of 2 is excluded, specifically \(2^{\text{idx}}\).
   - This means there are 21 elements in the list initially (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), but one is removed, leaving 20 elements.
   - After these 20 elements, three additional elements are added: \(k - \text{nums}[\text{idx}]\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + \text{nums}[\text{idx}] + 1\).

3. **Calculating the Length of `nums`:**
   - The list `nums` has 20 elements from the powers of 2 (excluding one).
   - Three additional elements are added to the list.
   - Therefore, the total length of `nums` is \(20 + 3 = 23\).

Given this detailed breakdown, the `print(len(nums))` statement will print the length of the `nums` list, which is 23.

Output: **23**
