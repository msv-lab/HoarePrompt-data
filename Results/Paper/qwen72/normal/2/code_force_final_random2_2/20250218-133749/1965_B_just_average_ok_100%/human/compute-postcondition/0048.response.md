Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. **`nums`**: This is a list of integers.
2. **`k`**: An integer value.
3. **`idx`**: Initially set to -1 if no element in `nums` is greater than `k`. If an element in `nums` is greater than `k`, `idx` is set to the index of the last element that is less than or equal to `k`.
4. **`i`**: Set to 20 if no element in `nums` is greater than `k`. If an element in `nums` is greater than `k`, `i` is the index of the first element greater than `k`.
5. **Length of `nums`**: Now 23.
6. **Last element in `nums`**: `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
7. **Element `1 << idx`**: Has been removed from `nums`.

### Analysis:
- **`nums`**: The list has 23 elements.
- **`idx`**: If no element in `nums` is greater than `k`, `idx` remains -1. Otherwise, `idx` is the index of the last element that is less than or equal to `k`.
- **`i`**: If no element in `nums` is greater than `k`, `i` is 20. Otherwise, `i` is the index of the first element greater than `k`.
- **Last element in `nums`**: `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
- **Element `1 << idx`**: Removed from `nums`.

### Steps to Determine the Output:
1. **Check the value of `idx`**:
   - If `idx` is -1, it means no element in `nums` is greater than `k`.
   - If `idx` is not -1, it means there is an element in `nums` greater than `k`.

2. **Determine the value of `i`**:
   - If `idx` is -1, `i` is 20.
   - If `idx` is not -1, `i` is the index of the first element greater than `k`.

3. **Last element in `nums`**:
   - The last element is `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

4. **Element `1 << idx`**:
   - This element has been removed from `nums`.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: No element in `nums` is greater than `k`.
  - `idx = -1`
  - `i = 20`
  - Last element in `nums` is `k + nums[-1] + 1` (since `nums[idx]` would be `nums[-1]` if `idx` is -1).
  - Element `1 << -1` (which is 0.5, but since `nums` contains integers, this is not valid, so this scenario is unlikely).

- **Scenario 2**: An element in `nums` is greater than `k`.
  - `idx` is the index of the last element that is less than or equal to `k`.
  - `i` is the index of the first element greater than `k`.
  - Last element in `nums` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
  - Element `1 << idx` has been removed from `nums`.

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and the initial state, the most likely scenario is that an element in `nums` is greater than `k`. Therefore, `idx` is a valid index, and the last element in `nums` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*nums)` statement will print all the elements in the list `nums`, which has 23 elements, with the element `1 << idx` removed and the last element being `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

Output: **[elements of nums excluding 1 << idx and including k + nums[idx] + 1]**
