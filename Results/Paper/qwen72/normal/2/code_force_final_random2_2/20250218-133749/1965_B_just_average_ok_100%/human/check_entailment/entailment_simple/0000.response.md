Reasoning:

The program aims to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers that meets the specified conditions for each test case. Let's break down the logic and verify if it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Initialization of `nums`**:
   - The list `nums` is initialized with the first 21 powers of 2: `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^20]`.
   - This ensures that any sum of these elements can represent any number up to \(2^{21} - 1\).

2. **Finding the appropriate index `idx`**:
   - The program iterates through `nums` to find the largest index `idx` such that `nums[idx] <= k`.
   - This helps in identifying the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Modifying `nums`**:
   - The program appends three new elements to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that `k + 1` can be formed.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This ensures that `k + nums[idx] + 1` can be formed.
   - The element `1 << idx` (which is `2^idx`) is removed from `nums`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the modified `nums` list.
   - It then prints the elements of `nums`.

### Verification of Conditions:
- **No subsequence sums to `k`**:
  - By removing `2^idx` and adding `k - nums[idx]`, the program ensures that no combination of the remaining elements can sum to `k`.
- **All other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed**:
  - The remaining elements in `nums` (powers of 2 and the added elements) ensure that any value from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed as a subsequence sum.

### Edge Cases:
- **Small values of `k`**:
  - For small values of `k`, the program correctly identifies the appropriate `idx` and modifies `nums` accordingly.
- **Large values of `k`**:
  - For large values of `k`, the program still correctly identifies the appropriate `idx` and modifies `nums` to ensure the conditions are met.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence `a` that meets the specified conditions for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
