To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
- `idx` is 0 if `nums[1] > k`, otherwise `idx` remains -1.
- `i` is 1.
- The length of `nums` is 21.
- The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the input values.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the `nums` list, which has a length of 21.
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 1.
- The length of `nums` is 21.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The length of `nums` remains 21.

### Updated State:
- `i` is 2.
- The length of `nums` is 21.

### Final State:
State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` is 0 if `nums[1] > k`, otherwise `idx` remains -1, `i` is 2, the length of `nums` is 21, and the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the input values.**
