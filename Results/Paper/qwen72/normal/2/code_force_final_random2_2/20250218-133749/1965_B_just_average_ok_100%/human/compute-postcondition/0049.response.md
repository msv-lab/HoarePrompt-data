The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. This loop iterates a fixed number of times based on the value returned by `int(input())`. Since the loop does not depend on the state of `nums`, `idx`, `i`, `n`, or `k` for its execution, these variables do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

However, since the question asks for the state at the start of the next iteration, we should note that the loop itself does not change the state of any variables in its head. Therefore, the state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, except for the fact that the loop will execute one more time if the input allows it.

State: **If no element in `nums` is greater than `k`, `idx` remains -1, and `i` is 20. If an element in `nums` is greater than `k`, `idx` is set to the index of the last element that is less than or equal to `k`, and `i` is the index of the first element greater than `k`. The length of `nums` is now 23, and the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The last element in `nums` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`. The element `1 << idx` has been removed from `nums`.**
