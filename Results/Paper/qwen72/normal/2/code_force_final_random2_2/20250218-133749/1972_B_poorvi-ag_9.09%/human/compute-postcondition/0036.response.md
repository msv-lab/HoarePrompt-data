Based on the initial state:

- `t` is the number of test cases provided initially.
- `i` is set to `t - 1`.
- `results` is a list containing at least `t` 'yes' or 'no' entries for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop.
- The loop will process the `t`-th element in the next iteration.

Given this information, the value of `i` is `t - 1`.

When the `print(i)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i`, which is `t - 1`.

Output: **t - 1 (where t is the number of test cases provided initially)**
