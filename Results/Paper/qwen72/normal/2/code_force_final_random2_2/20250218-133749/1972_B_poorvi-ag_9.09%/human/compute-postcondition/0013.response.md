Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is a list containing either 'yes', 'no', or a single 'no'. `func` is expected to process multiple test cases, each including a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string. If `n` is even, `results` contains a single 'no'. If `n` is odd, `results` contains 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is greater than the number of 'D' characters, otherwise `results` contains 'no'.***
