Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is the number of test cases provided initially.
- `i` is set to `t - 1`.
- `results` is a list containing at least `t` entries, each being either 'yes' or 'no'.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

### Explanation:
- `i` is defined as `t - 1`.
- Since `t` is the number of test cases, `i` will be one less than the total number of test cases.

### Output:
Output: **t - 1 (where t is the number of test cases provided initially)**
