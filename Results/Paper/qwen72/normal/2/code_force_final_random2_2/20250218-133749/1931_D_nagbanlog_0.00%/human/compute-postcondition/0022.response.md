Output State: **`mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, all other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet only updates the value of `mod_y` by calculating the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, `beautiful_count`, `num`, `mod_x`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `mod_y` is specifically the remainder when `num` (which is the second element of `a`) is divided by `y`.
