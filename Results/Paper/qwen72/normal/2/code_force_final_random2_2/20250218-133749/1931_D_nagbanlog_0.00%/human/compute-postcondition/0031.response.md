The only object in the loop head is the variable `num` and the iterable `a`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the iterable `a`. If there are more elements in `a`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the current element being processed from `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be set to the next element in `a`, and `a` must still have elements remaining for the loop to continue.

State: **`mod_y` is the remainder when the next `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, and if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.** 

However, to strictly adhere to the task of adjusting only the states of objects in the loop head:

State: **`num` is the next element in `a`, `a` must have at least one more element.**
