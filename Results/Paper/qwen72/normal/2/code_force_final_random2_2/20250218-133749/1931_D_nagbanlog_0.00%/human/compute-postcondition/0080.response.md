Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples, `case` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing one element which is 0, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is the array from `case['array']` and must contain at least three elements, `freq` is a dictionary where `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` is 0 unless `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, in which case `beautiful_count` is set to `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]`, `num` is the third element in `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `required_mod_y = mod_y` assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The specific values of `mod_y` and `required_mod_y` are the same, as `required_mod_y` is now equal to `mod_y`.
- The rest of the variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, `beautiful_count`, `num`, `mod_x`, `required_mod_x`) retain their initial values or relationships.
