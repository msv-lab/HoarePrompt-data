Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least three tuples, `case` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is 0, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is a non-empty list, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is now `freq[(x - (a[0] % x)) % x, a[0] % y]`, `num` is the first element of `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.** 

Explanation: The code increments `beautiful_count` by the value found in the dictionary `freq` at the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`. Since `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - (a[0] % x)) % x` and `required_mod_y` is `a[0] % y`, the new value of `beautiful_count` is `freq[(x - (a[0] % x)) % x, a[0] % y]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
