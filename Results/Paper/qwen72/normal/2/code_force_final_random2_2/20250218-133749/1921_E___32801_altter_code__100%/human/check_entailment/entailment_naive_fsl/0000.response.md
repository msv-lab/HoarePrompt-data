Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. One specific issue is in the handling of the game logic when the players are in positions that should result in a draw but incorrectly returns a win for Alice or Bob. 

For example, consider the following test case:
```
h = 4, w = 4, x_a = 1, y_a = 1, x_b = 4, y_b = 4
```
In this scenario, Alice starts at the top-left corner and Bob starts at the bottom-right corner. According to the rules, Alice can only move down, down-right, or down-left, and Bob can only move up, up-right, or up-left. Since Alice is at the top and Bob is at the bottom, neither can move into a position where they can capture the other. Therefore, the game should end in a draw. However, the program might incorrectly return "Alice" or "Bob" as the winner due to the complex logic and potential off-by-one errors in the calculations.

This indicates that the program does not correctly handle all edge cases and may produce incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
