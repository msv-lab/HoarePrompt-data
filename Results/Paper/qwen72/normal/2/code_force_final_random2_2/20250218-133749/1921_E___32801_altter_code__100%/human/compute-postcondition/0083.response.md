The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the context provided, it is implied that the function processes a series of test cases, each containing six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. These integers are constrained such that `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6`, `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9`, and either `x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b`. The function processes these test cases but does not return any value in any of the specified cases.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing six integers representing dimensions and coordinates, but does not return any value.**
