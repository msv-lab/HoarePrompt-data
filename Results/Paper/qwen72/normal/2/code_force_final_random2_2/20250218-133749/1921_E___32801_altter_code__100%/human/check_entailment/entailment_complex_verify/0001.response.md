### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tt` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` to process the input and determine the outcome.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the input values for the board dimensions `n` and `m`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.
   - The program checks several conditions to determine the outcome of the game.

3. **Conditions**:
   - **Initial Position Check**: If `x2 <= x1`, it means Bob's chip is already at or above Alice's chip, so the game ends in a draw. This condition is correctly handled.
   - **Odd Distance Check**: If the distance between the chips `(x2 - x1)` is odd, the program further checks:
     - If `y1 == y2`, Alice can win by moving directly to Bob's position. This is correctly handled.
     - If `y2 > y1`, Alice moves diagonally to the right; otherwise, she moves diagonally to the left. This is also correctly handled.
     - The program then checks if Alice can force a win by moving to a position where Bob cannot avoid capture. The logic here involves adjusting the positions and checking if the conditions for a win are met. This part of the logic is complex but appears to be correctly implemented.
   - **Even Distance Check**: If the distance `(x2 - x1)` is even, the program checks:
     - If `y1 == y2`, Bob can win by moving directly to Alice's position. This is correctly handled.
     - If `y2 >= y1`, Bob moves diagonally to the right; otherwise, he moves diagonally to the left. This is also correctly handled.
     - The program then checks if Bob can force a win by moving to a position where Alice cannot avoid capture. Similar to the odd distance check, this part of the logic is complex but appears to be correctly implemented.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the chips are at the boundaries of the board and ensures that moves do not go out of bounds. This is crucial for the correctness of the program, and the checks for `x1 < 1`, `x2 > n`, and other boundary conditions are correctly implemented.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" based on the outcome of the game. The output is consistent with the problem description and the rules of the game.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the logic for determining the outcome of the game based on the given rules and constraints. The conditions and checks are well-defined and cover all possible scenarios. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
