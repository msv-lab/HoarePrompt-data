Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b] where 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6, 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9, and either x_a != x_b or y_a != y_b. `n` is equal to `h`, `m` is equal to `w`, `x1` is equal to `x_a`, `y1` is equal to `y_a`, `x2` is equal to `x_b`, and `y2` is equal to `y_b`. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1`. The difference between `x2` and `x1` is even. `y1` is not equal to `y2`. The current value of `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`.**
