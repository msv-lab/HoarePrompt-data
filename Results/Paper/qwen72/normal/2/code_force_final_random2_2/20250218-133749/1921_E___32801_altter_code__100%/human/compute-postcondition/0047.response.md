Postcondition: ***`t` is equal to `abs(y_b - y_a + 1)` if `y1` >= `y2`, or `abs(y_b - y_a - 1)` if `y1` < `y2`; `r` is a list of six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`; `n` is equal to `h`; `m` is equal to `w`; `x1` is equal to `x_a + 1 + a`; `x2` is now equal to `x_b - a`; `x2` is greater than `x1`; the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number; `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`; `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. If `y2` <= `y1`, then `y2` is 1, `c` is `y1 - 1`, and `a` is adjusted based on the initial values of `y1` and `y2`. If `y2` > `y1`, then `y2` is `m`, `c` is `m - y1`, and `a` is adjusted based on the initial values of `y1` and `y2`. Additionally, either `b // 2 <= a`, or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`, or `y1 < 1`, or `y1 > m`, or `x1 < 1`, or `x1 > n`.***
