Output State: **`t` is equal to `abs(y_b - y_a + 1)` if `y1` >= `y2`, or `abs(y_b - y_a - 1)` if `y1` < `y2`; `r` is a list of six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`; `n` is equal to `h`; `m` is equal to `w`; `x1` is equal to `x_a + 1 + a`; `x2` is now equal to `x_b - a`; `x2` is greater than `x1`; the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number; `y1` is not equal to `y2`; if `y1` >= `y2`, then `y1` is equal to `y_a - 1 - (y_b - 1)`, `y2` is now 1, and `a` is equal to `y_b - 1`; if `y1` < `y2`, then `y1` is equal to `y_a + 1 - (w - y_b)`, `y2` is now 1, and `a` is equal to `w - y_b`; `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`; `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. Additionally, `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`; `c` is equal to `y1 - 1`.**
