Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 1, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` (where `func_2()` is less than `n`).**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: The value of `i` remains unchanged throughout the loop, so it is still 1.
- **`n`**: The condition that `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 1 remains unchanged because it is part of the initial state and not modified by the loop.
- **`k`**: The value of `k` must be a positive integer, which is also part of the initial state and not modified by the loop.
- **`cnt`**: The variable `cnt` starts as `k` and is decremented by 1 each time the loop runs. After all iterations, `cnt` will be 0 because the loop runs until `cnt` is no longer greater than 0.
- **`l`**: The variable `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1` each time the loop runs. The final value of `l` will be `func_2() + 1`, where `func_2()` must return a value less than `n` for the loop to continue running.
