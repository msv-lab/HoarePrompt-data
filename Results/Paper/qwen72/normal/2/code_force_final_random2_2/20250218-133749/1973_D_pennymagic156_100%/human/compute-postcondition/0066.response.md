The code `l = func_2() + 1` updates the value of `l` to be one more than the value returned by `func_2()`. Since `func_2()` must be less than `n`, the new value of `l` will be `func_2() + 1`, which is also less than `n + 1`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged:
- `i` is still 3.
- `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 3.
- `k` must be a positive integer.
- `cnt` is still `k`.
- `l` is now `func_2() + 1`.
- `l` is still not equal to `n + 1`.
- `func_2()` must be less than `n`.
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 3, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, `func_2()` must be less than `n`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**
