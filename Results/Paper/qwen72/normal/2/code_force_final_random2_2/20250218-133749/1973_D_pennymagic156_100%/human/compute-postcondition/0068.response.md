To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `cnt`**
   - The loop will execute if `cnt` is non-zero.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` is `k - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `cnt` must still be non-zero. Therefore, `cnt` should remain as `k - 1`.

2. **Condition 2: `l < n + 1`**
   - The loop will execute if `l` is less than `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `l` must still be less than `n + 1`.
   - Given that `func_2()` must be less than `n`, `l` (which is `func_2() + 1`) must be less than `n + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`cnt`**: Since `cnt` is `k - 1` and must be non-zero, no adjustment is needed for `cnt`.
- **`l`**: Since `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `func_2()` must be less than `n`, `l` must be less than `n + 1`. No adjustment is needed for `l`.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are needed for the variables `cnt` and `l` in the loop head for the loop to execute one more time. The current state already satisfies the conditions for the loop to proceed.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 3, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, `func_2()` must be less than `n`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**
