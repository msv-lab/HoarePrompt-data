Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 3.
- `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 3.
- `k` must be a positive integer and greater than 2.
- `cnt` is `k - 2`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
- `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.
- `func_2()` must be less than `n`.
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: 
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.

2. **Variable `n`**:
   - `n` must satisfy the condition `n // k >= 3`. This means `n` must be at least `3 * k`.

3. **Variable `k`**:
   - `k` is a positive integer greater than 2.

4. **Variable `cnt`**:
   - `cnt` is defined as `k - 2`. Since `k > 2`, `cnt` will always be a positive integer.

5. **Variable `l`**:
   - `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`.
   - `func_2()` must be less than `n`.
   - `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

6. **Variable `v`**:
   - The variable `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. We need to assume it is defined elsewhere in the code, but for the purpose of this task, we will treat it as an unknown value.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Explanation:
- The print statement will output a string formatted as `? {l} {i * v}`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`, where `func_2()` is some function that returns a value less than `n`.
- `i` is 3.
- `v` is an unknown value.

### Output:
- The exact value of `l` depends on the return value of `func_2()`, which is not specified.
- The exact value of `i * v` depends on the value of `v`, which is not specified.

Given the information, the output will be:
Output: **? [func_2() + 1] [3 * v] (where func_2() is a value less than n and v is an unknown value)**
