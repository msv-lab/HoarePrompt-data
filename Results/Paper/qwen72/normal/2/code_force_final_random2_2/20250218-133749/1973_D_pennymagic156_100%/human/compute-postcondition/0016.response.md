Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is set to `n - 2`.
- `v` is the return value of `func_2()`, but if `v` equals `n`, it is updated to `n - 1` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - According to the initial state, `i` is `n - 2`.
   - Therefore, `i = n - 2`.

2. **Calculate the expression `i * n`:**
   - Substitute `i` with `n - 2`:
     \[
     i * n = (n - 2) * n = n^2 - 2n
     \]

3. **Construct the string to be printed:**
   - The `print` statement uses an f-string to format the output.
   - The string will be `'? 1 {i * n}'`, where `{i * n}` is replaced by the calculated value `n^2 - 2n`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'? 1 {n^2 - 2n}'`, where `n^2 - 2n` is the result of the expression `(n - 2) * n`.

Output: **? 1 {n^2 - 2n} (where n^2 - 2n is the result of (n - 2) * n)**
