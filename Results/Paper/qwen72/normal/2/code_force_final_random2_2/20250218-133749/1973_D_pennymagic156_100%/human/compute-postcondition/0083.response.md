Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` remains unchanged (its value is not specified, but it is assumed to be a constant).
- `k` remains unchanged (its value is not specified, but it is assumed to be a constant).
- `cnt` is 0.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` (where `func_2()` is less than `n`).
- `v` is the last value of `i * v` printed before the loop exits.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('! -1', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.
- The string `'! -1'` is a literal string that will be printed directly.
- The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately written to the console without buffering, but it does not affect the content of the string being printed.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the string `'! -1'` followed by a newline character.

Output: **! -1**
