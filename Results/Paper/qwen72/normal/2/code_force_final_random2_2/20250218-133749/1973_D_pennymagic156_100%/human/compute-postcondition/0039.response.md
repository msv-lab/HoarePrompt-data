The function `func_2()` is called, but since no return value from `func_2()` is assigned to any variable, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The only impact is that `func_2()` is executed, which might have side effects depending on its implementation, but these are not specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 1, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `n + 1`.**
