The code snippet `l = func_2() + 1` updates the value of `l` by calling `func_2()` and adding 1 to its result. Given the initial conditions, let's analyze the impact:

- `i` remains 2.
- `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 2.
- `k` must be a positive integer greater than 2.
- `cnt` remains `k - 2`.
- `l` was initially `func_2() + 1`, and now it is updated to `func_2() + 1` again. However, since `func_2()` must be less than `n`, the new value of `l` is still `func_2() + 1`, which is less than `n + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 2, `k` must be a positive integer greater than 2, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is not equal to `n + 1` and `func_2()` must be less than `n`.**
