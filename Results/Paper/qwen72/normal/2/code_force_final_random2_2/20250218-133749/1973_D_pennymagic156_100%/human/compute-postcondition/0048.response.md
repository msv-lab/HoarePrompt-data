To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `cnt`**
   - The variable `cnt` must be non-zero for the loop to continue.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` is `k - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must still be non-zero. Therefore, `k` must be greater than 1 (since `cnt = k - 1`).

2. **Condition 2: `l < n + 1`**
   - The variable `l` must be less than `n + 1` for the loop to continue.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must still be less than `n + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`cnt`**: Since `cnt` is `k - 1`, and `k` must be greater than 1 for `cnt` to be non-zero, no adjustment is needed for `cnt` as long as `k` remains greater than 1.
- **`l`**: `l` must be less than `n + 1`. Given that `l` is `func_2() + 1`, we need to ensure that `func_2() + 1` is less than `n + 1`. This implies that `func_2()` must be less than `n`.

### Conclusion:
- `cnt` is already non-zero as long as `k` is greater than 1.
- `l` must be less than `n + 1`, which means `func_2()` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the end of the previous iteration, adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 2, `k` must be a positive integer greater than 1, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is not equal to `n + 1` and `func_2()` must be less than `n`**
