The function `func_5` does not explicitly accept any parameters based on the provided signature. However, according to the parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should operate under the conditions where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4. Despite these constraints, the function does not return any value in all cases described (Case_1, Case_2, Case_3, and Case_4).

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
