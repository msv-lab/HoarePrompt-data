Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 1, where `k` is a positive integer.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`, where `func_2()` is less than `n`.
- `cnt` is currently 0.
- `l` is currently equal to `n + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The value of `i` is explicitly given as 1.
2. **Variable `v`**: The variable `v` is not defined in the initial state. Since it is not defined, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, we cannot compute `i * v` precisely.

### Conclusion:
Since `v` is not defined in the initial state, the value of `i * v` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output of the print statement will include the expression `i * v` as it is.

Output: **! 1 * v**
