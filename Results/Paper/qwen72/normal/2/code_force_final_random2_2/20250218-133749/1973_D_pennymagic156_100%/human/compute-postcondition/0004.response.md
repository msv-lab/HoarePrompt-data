To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the code snippet on the variables given in the initial state. The code snippet assigns the result of the function `func_2()` to the variable `v`.

Since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine its exact return value. However, we can state that `v` will now hold whatever value `func_2()` returns.

The other variables (`n` and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `v` is the return value of `func_2()`, `i` is `n`.**
