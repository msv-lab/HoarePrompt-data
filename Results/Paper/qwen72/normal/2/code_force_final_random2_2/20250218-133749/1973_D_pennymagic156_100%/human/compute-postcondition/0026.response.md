To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
l = func_2() + 1
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 1
   - `k` must be a positive integer
   - `cnt` is `k`
   - `l` is 1

2. **Code Impact:**
   - The variable `l` is reassigned the value of `func_2() + 1`.
   - The function `func_2()` is called, and its return value is added to 1.
   - The new value of `l` is the result of this addition.

3. **Checking Affected Variables:**
   - `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1`.
   - Other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

4. **Calculating the Result:**
   - Since the specific implementation of `func_2()` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value it returns. However, we know that `l` will be the return value of `func_2()` plus 1.

### Output State:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 1
- `k` must be a positive integer
- `cnt` is `k`
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 1, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**
