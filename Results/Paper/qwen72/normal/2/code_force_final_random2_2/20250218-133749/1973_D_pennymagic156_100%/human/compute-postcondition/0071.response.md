Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 3, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, `func_2()` must be less than `n`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.** 

The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1, changing from `k - 1` to `k - 2`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
