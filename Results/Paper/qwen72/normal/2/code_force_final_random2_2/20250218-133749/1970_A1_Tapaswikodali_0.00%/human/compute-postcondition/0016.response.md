The value of `balance` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `balance` depends on the first two characters of `s`. If the first character is '(' and the second character is '(', `balance` starts at 2. If the first character is '(' and the second character is ')', `balance` starts at 0. If the first character is ')' and the second character is ')', `balance` starts at -2. After incrementing `balance` by 1, the new value of `balance` will be 3, 1, or -1, respectively.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character of `s`, `balance` is 3 if the first character of `s` is '(' and the second character is '(', otherwise `balance` is 1 if the first character of `s` is '(' and the second character is ')', or `balance` is -1 if the first character of `s` is ')' and the second character is ')', and `details` is a list containing the tuples (1 if the first character of `s` is '(', otherwise -1, 0, first character of `s`) and (balance, -1, second character of `s`).**
