Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` is overly simplified and does not consider the game's rules accurately. Here is a case where the program fails:

### Test Case:
```
Input:
1
3
UUD
```

### Expected Output:
```
NO
```

### Actual Output:
```
YES
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial State:** `UUD`
- **Alice's Turn:**
  - Alice can only choose the first 'U' (since it's the only facing-up coin).
  - After removing the first 'U', the state becomes `DD`.
- **Bob's Turn:**
  - Bob has no facing-up coins to choose from, so he loses.

However, the program incorrectly returns "YES" because it only checks if the number of 'U's is odd, which is not sufficient to determine the winner in all cases. The game's rules require a more detailed simulation to accurately determine the winner. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
