Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers. `aa` is a list of strings, each element being a string representation of the input values split by spaces. `bb` is a list of strings, each element being a string representation of the new input values split by spaces. `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`. `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of the elements in `bb`. `D` is the intersection (element-wise minimum) of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`. `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`. `E` is the Counter object resulting from subtracting `D` from `cnt_aa`. `C` is the Counter object resulting from subtracting `D` from `cnt_bb`. `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0. `_` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements, `in_aa` is the first element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element of `aa[:n - m]`, `C[in_aa]` and `D[in_aa]` are updated based on the conditions, `D[out_aa]` and `E[out_aa]` are updated based on the conditions, `pairs_in_D` is updated based on the conditions, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. All other initial conditions remain valid.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: If `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, `fnd` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. All other conditions and variables remain as they were in the initial state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
