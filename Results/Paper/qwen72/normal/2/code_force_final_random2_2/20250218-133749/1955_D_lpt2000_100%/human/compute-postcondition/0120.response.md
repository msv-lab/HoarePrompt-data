Output State: **`pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned integer values from user input, `aa` is a list of strings where each element is a string from user input split by spaces, `bb` is a new list of strings where each element is a string from user input split by spaces, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection (minimum counts) of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, and the count of `in_aa` in `D` is incremented by 1, `E` is a Counter object containing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, `m` must be less than `n`, and `n - m` must be greater than 0, the next `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, the next `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`.**
