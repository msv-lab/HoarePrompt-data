Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, representing the lengths of arrays a and b, and the required number of matching elements. Arrays a and b contain integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and b_1, b_2, ..., b_m respectively, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. `nabors` is an input integer.**
