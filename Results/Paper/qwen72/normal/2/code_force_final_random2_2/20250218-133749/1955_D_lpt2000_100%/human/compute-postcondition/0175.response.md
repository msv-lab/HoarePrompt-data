Output State: **`pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` (before decrement) was greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. The next pair `(in_aa, out_aa)` will be the next elements from the slices `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` respectively. The value of `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**
