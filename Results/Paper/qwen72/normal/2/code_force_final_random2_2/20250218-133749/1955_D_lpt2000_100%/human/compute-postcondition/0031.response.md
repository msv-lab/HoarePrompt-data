Postcondition: **`nabors` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `aa` is a list of strings derived from the input with at least `n` elements, `bb` is a list of strings derived from the new input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` with values being the minimum counts of common elements, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements of `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` with their respective frequencies, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements of `cnt_bb` that are not in `D` with their respective frequencies, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `in_aa` is the first element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element of `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` > 0, then `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 (but remains non-negative), `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1, and `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. If `C[in_aa]` > 0, then `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, and `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is 0, then `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.**
