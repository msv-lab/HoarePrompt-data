Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers. `aa` is a list of strings, each element being a string representation of the input values split by spaces. `bb` is a list of strings, each element being a string representation of the new input values split by spaces. `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`. `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of the elements in `bb`. `D` is the intersection (element-wise minimum) of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`. `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`. The values of `fnd`, `E`, `C`, and `_` remain unchanged.**
