Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers. The values of `fnd`, `D`, `E`, `C`, `pairs_in_D`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, and `_` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of the other variables (`fnd`, `D`, `E`, `C`, `pairs_in_D`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, and `_`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet.
