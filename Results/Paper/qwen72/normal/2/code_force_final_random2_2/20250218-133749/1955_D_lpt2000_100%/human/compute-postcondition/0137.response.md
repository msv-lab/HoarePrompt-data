Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers. `aa` is a list of strings, each element being a string representation of the input values split by spaces. `bb` is a list of strings, each element being a string representation of the new input values split by spaces. `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`. `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of the elements in `bb`. `D` is the intersection (element-wise minimum) of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`. `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`. `E` is the Counter object resulting from subtracting `D` from `cnt_aa`. `C` is the Counter object resulting from subtracting `D` from `cnt_bb`. `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0. `_` remains unchanged.**
