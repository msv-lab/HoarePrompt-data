You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the following changes occur: `fnd` will contain the total number of times `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution. The `D`, `E`, and `C` Counter objects will be updated to their final states, reflecting the last sliding window of `aa` and the entire `bb`. Specifically, `D` will contain the final intersection of the current sliding window with `bb`, `E` will contain the elements in the current sliding window that are not in `D`, and `C` will contain the elements in `bb` that are not in the current sliding window. The `pairs_in_D` will be the final sum of the values in `D`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will remain unchanged, as will the lists `aa` and `bb` and the Counter objects `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and arrays `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates the number of positions in array `a` (from index `m` to `n`) where the number of common elements between the current sliding window of `a` and the entire array `b` is at least `k`. The function prints the count of such positions for each test case. The original arrays `a` and `b`, and the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged after the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`nabors`).
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the arrays `aa` and `bb` from the input, converting them to strings (which is unnecessary but does not affect correctness).

2. **Initial Counters:**
   - It initializes `cnt_aa` with the first `m` elements of `aa`.
   - It initializes `cnt_bb` with all elements of `bb`.

3. **Intersection and Difference Counters:**
   - `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, representing the common elements.
   - `pairs_in_D` is the sum of values in `D`, which represents the number of matching elements.
   - `E` is the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, representing elements in `aa` that are not in `D`.
   - `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, representing elements in `bb` that are not in `D`.

4. **Initial Check:**
   - It checks if the initial `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`. If so, it increments `fnd` (the count of good subsegments).

5. **Sliding Window:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of length `m` in `aa`.
   - For each new element added to the window (`in_aa`), it updates the counters `D`, `E`, and `C` accordingly.
   - For each element removed from the window (`out_aa`), it also updates the counters.
   - It checks if the updated `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` and increments `fnd` if true.

6. **Output:**
   - After processing all subsegments, it prints the value of `fnd` for the current test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subsegments.
- The use of `Counter` and the sliding window approach ensures that the program efficiently handles the constraints and correctly updates the counts.
- The program handles edge cases and the constraints as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
