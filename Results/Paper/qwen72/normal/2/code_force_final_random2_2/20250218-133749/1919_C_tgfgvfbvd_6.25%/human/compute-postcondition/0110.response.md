Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (if such an element exists; otherwise, `b` remains 0), `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the element where the condition `l[y] > l[y - 1]` was met (or `n-1` if no such element exists), `x` is `y + 1`, and `y + 1` must be less than `n`. Additionally, either `l[x]` is not less than `a` or `l[x]` is not less than `b` (or both).**
