Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 2`, `n` must be greater than `y + 2`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is increased by 1, and either `a` or `b` is set to `l[y + 2]` based on the condition `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then either `a` or `b` is set to `l[y + 2]` based on the condition `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is set to `l[y + 2]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, otherwise, `b` is set to `l[y + 2]`.***
