Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is 0 or 1, `y` is the index of the element where the condition `l[y] > l[y - 1]` was met (or `n-1` if no such element exists), and `x` is `y + 2` with `y + 2` being less than `n`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `a` is the first element in the list `l`, and `b` is the value of `l[x]`. Otherwise, if `a >= l[x]`, then `a` is the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l`, and `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (if such an element exists; otherwise, `b` remains 0). If neither of these conditions is met, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, and `b` is the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l`.***
