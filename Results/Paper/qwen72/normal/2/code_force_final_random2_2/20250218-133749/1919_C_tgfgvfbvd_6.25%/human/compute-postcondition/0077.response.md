Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `b` is the last element in the list `l` that was either greater than the previous `b` or less than the previous `b` but closer to it than `a`, `c` is the count of elements in the list `l` from index `y + 1` to `n - 1` that were greater than both `a` and `b` and met the condition `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b` or `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`, `y` is the index of the element `b` in the list `l` or `n-1` if no such element exists.**
