Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the element where the condition `l[y] > l[y - 1]` was met (or `n-1` if no such element exists), `x` is `y + 1`, and `y + 1` must be less than `n`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then: if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `b` remains unchanged; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `a` remains unchanged. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then: if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, `a` is set to `l[x]` and `b` remains unchanged; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]` and `a` remains unchanged.***
