Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `b` is the second element in the list `l`, `c` is 0, `y` is 1, and the second element of `l` (i.e., `l[1]`) is greater than the first element of `l` (i.e., `l[0]`). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
