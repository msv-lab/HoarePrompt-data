Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 2`, `n` must be greater than `y + 2`. If `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, then `a` is set to `l[y + 2]`. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[y + 2]`.***
