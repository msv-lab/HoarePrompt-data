Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the first element in the list `l` that is greater than its preceding element, or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the element `b` in the list `l` or `n-1` if no such element exists.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `y` must be less than `n - 1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is set to 1, and either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`. In both cases, `l[x]` is greater than the new values of `a` and `b`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[x] > b - l[x]`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than `a` or `l[x]` is not less than `b`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `b` remains unchanged. If `l[x]` is not less than `a` or `l[x]` is not less than `b`, and `a` is less than `l[x]`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `a` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 2`, `n` must be greater than `y + 2`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is increased by 1, and either `a` or `b` is set to `l[y + 2]` based on the condition `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then either `a` or `b` is set to `l[y + 2]` based on the condition `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is set to `l[y + 2]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, otherwise, `b` is set to `l[y + 2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 3`, and `n` must be greater than `y + 3`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then: if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, `a` is the element at index `x` in the list `l`; otherwise, `b` is the element at index `x` in the list `l`, and `c` is increased by 1. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then: if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, `a` is the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`; otherwise, `b` is the value of `l[y + 3]`. If `l[x] >= a` or `l[x] >= b`, then: if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[y + 3]`, `a` is `l[y + 3]`; otherwise, `b` is `l[y + 3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
