To determine what will be printed by the `print(c)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `a` is the last element in the list `l` that was either greater than or equal to the previous `a` or less than the previous `a` but closer to it than `b`.
   - `b` is the last element in the list `l` that was either greater than the previous `b` or less than the previous `b` but closer to it than `a`.
   - `c` is the count of elements in the list `l` from index `y + 1` to `n - 1` that were greater than both `a` and `b` and met the condition `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b` or `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`.
   - `y` is the index of the element `b` in the list `l` or `n-1` if no such element exists.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` and `b` are determined based on the conditions provided. These are specific elements in the list `l` that meet certain criteria.
   - `y` is the index of the element `b` in the list `l`. If no such element exists, `y` is set to `n-1`.
   - `c` is the count of elements in the list `l` from index `y + 1` to `n - 1` that satisfy the given conditions.

3. **Determining the Value of `c`:**
   - To find `c`, we need to iterate through the list `l` starting from index `y + 1` to `n - 1`.
   - For each element `l[x]` in this range, check if it is greater than both `a` and `b`.
   - Additionally, check if the condition `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b` or `l[x] - a < l[x] - b` is satisfied.
   - Count the number of elements that meet these conditions.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(c)` statement will print the value of `c`, which is the count of elements in the list `l` from index `y + 1` to `n - 1` that are greater than both `a` and `b` and meet the specified condition.

Given the complexity and the specific conditions, the exact numerical value of `c` cannot be determined without the actual values of `l`, `a`, `b`, and `y`. However, based on the provided information, the output will be the count of such elements.

Output: **c (where c is the count of elements in the list l from index y + 1 to n - 1 that are greater than both a and b and meet the condition l[x] - a >= l[x] - b or l[x] - a < l[x] - b)**
