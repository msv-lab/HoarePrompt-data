To determine what will be printed by the `print(c)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `t`: A positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `_`: A constant integer with the value 2.
   - `n`: An input integer, which represents the length of the list `l`.
   - `l`: A list of integers provided by the user.
   - `a`: The last element in the list `l` that was processed by the loop.
   - `b`: The last element in the list `l` that was processed by the loop.
   - `c`: The number of times the condition `l[x] > a and l[x] > b` was true during the loop.
   - `y`: The index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or `n-1` if no such element exists).
   - `x`: The value of `n`.

2. **Understanding the Loop and Condition:**
   - The loop processes elements in the list `l`.
   - `a` and `b` are updated to the last two elements processed by the loop.
   - `c` counts the number of times the condition `l[x] > a and l[x] > b` is true, where `x` is the current index in the loop.
   - `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element. If no such element exists, `y` is set to `n-1`.

3. **Final Value of `c`:**
   - The value of `c` is determined by how many times the condition `l[x] > a and l[x] > b` was true during the loop.
   - Since the exact list `l` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `c`. However, based on the structure of the problem, `c` will be the count of such occurrences.

Given this understanding, the `print(c)` statement will output the value of `c`, which is the number of times the condition `l[x] > a and l[x] > b` was true during the loop.

Output: **c (where c is the number of times the condition `l[x] > a and l[x] > b` was true during the loop)**
