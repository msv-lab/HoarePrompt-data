Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the element where the condition `l[y] > l[y - 1]` was met (or `n-1` if no such element exists), and `x` is `n` (indicating the loop has completed its iterations).**
