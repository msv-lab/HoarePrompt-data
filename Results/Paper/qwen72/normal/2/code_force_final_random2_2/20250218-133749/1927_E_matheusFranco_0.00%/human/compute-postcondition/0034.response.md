Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `k` remain integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i]` is set to `i // k + 1` for every multiple of `k` (i.e., `i % k == 0`), and remains 0 otherwise, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n // k + 1 + (len(permutation) - 1) // k`, `i` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + ((len(permutation) - 1) // k) * k`, and `permutation` has been updated such that for each index `j` starting from 1 and increasing by `k`, `permutation[j]` is set to `n // k + 1 + j // k`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to update the `permutation` list by setting `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` to the current value of `curr_v` and then incrementing `curr_v` and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`.
- The loop stops when `multiples_of_k_plus_i` reaches or exceeds the length of the `permutation` list.
- After the loop completes, `curr_v` will be `n // k + 1 + (len(permutation) - 1) // k`, which accounts for the number of times the loop has executed.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `1 + ((len(permutation) - 1) // k) * k`, which is the final value of the index that was checked.
- The `permutation` list will have been updated such that for each index `j` starting from 1 and increasing by `k`, `permutation[j]` is set to `n // k + 1 + j // k`.
