To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
```

The loop will execute if `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the `permutation` list.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is the variable being compared.
   - `len(permutation)` is the length of the `permutation` list.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(k\) is even.
   - `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
   - `idx` is 0.
   - `idx_v` is 1.
   - `curr_v` is `n // k + 1`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than `len(permutation)`.
   - Given the initial state, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1.
   - `len(permutation)` is `n`.

4. **Check Initial Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute, `1 < n` must be true.
   - Since `n` is an integer and \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `n` is always greater than 1.

### Conclusion:
Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2, the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i]` is set to `i // k + 1` for every multiple of `k` (i.e., `i % k == 0`), and remains 0 otherwise, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n // k + 1`, `i` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1**
