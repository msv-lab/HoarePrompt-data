Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros except `permutation[0]` which is 1 and `permutation[k]` which is 2, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is 3, `i` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 * k`.**

Explanation: The variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` was initially set to `k`. After executing the line `multiples_of_k_plus_i += k`, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes `2 * k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
