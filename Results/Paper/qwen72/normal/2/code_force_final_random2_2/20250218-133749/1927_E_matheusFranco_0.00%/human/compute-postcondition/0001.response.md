The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer value between 1 and 10^4, which ensures that `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed.

State: **No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads an integer `t` from standard input, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `t` is now an integer value between 1 and 10^4.**
