To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `len(permutation)`.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2.
   - `len(permutation)` is `n` (since `permutation` is a list of length `n`).

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.
   - Substituting the initial values, the condition becomes `2 < n`.

4. **Check the Initial State:**
   - From the given state, `n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.
   - Since `n` is at least 2, the condition `2 < n` will always be true for any valid `n`.

### Conclusion:
Since `n` is at least 2, the condition `2 < n` will always be true, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` remain integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i]` is set to `i // k + 1` for every multiple of `k` (i.e., `i % k == 0`), and remains 0 otherwise, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n // k + 1 + (len(permutation) - 1) // k`, `i` is 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2, and `permutation` has been updated such that for each index `j` starting from 1 and increasing by `k`, `permutation[j]` is set to `n // k + 1 + j // k`**.
