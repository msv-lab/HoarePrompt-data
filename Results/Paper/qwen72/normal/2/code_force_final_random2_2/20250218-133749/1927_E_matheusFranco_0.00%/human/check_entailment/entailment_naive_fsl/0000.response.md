Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program follows the problem description accurately and handles all potential cases correctly. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case using a loop. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Permutation Construction**: The function `func_1` constructs a permutation of length `n` such that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. It does this by distributing the values in a way that ensures the sums of these segments are balanced.

3. **Balanced Distribution**: The program uses a nested loop to place values in the permutation array. It starts with the first index and places values at positions that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i`. This ensures that the values are distributed evenly across the permutation, maintaining the required property of the sums of segments of length `k`.

4. **Output**: The constructed permutation is printed for each test case.

The program correctly handles the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description. It ensures that the permutation is valid and that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
