The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. It generates a permutation of the numbers from 1 to `n` such that each element at an index that is a multiple of `k` is set to a specific value based on the sequence, and the remaining elements are filled with the next available values in the sequence. The function then prints this permutation as a space-separated string. After the function completes, `n` and `k` retain their original values, and the permutation list is fully populated and printed.
