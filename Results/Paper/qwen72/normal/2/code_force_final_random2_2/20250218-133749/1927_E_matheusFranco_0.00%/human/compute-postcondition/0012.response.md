Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from standard input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, representing the number of test cases. It then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function completes, `t` is 0, and `func_1` has been called `t` times, where `t` was initially an integer value between 1 and 10^4. The function does not return any value. **
