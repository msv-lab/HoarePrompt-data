Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `k` remain integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i]` is set to `i // k + 1` for every index `i` that is a multiple of `k` (i.e., `i % k == 0`), and for every index `i` that is not a multiple of `k`, `permutation[i]` is set to the next available value of `curr_v` in the sequence. The variable `curr_v` will be equal to `n + 1` after the loop completes, and the loop variable `i` will be equal to `k`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `k` times, and in each iteration, it updates the `permutation` list for indices that are multiples of `k` plus the current iteration index `i`.
- For each iteration `i`, the loop sets `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` to the current value of `curr_v` and then increments `curr_v`.
- After the loop completes, `permutation` will contain values from `1` to `n` in a specific pattern based on the multiples of `k`.
- The variable `curr_v` will be incremented `n` times, so it will be `n + 1` at the end.
- The loop variable `i` will be equal to `k` after the loop completes, as it iterates from `0` to `k-1`.
