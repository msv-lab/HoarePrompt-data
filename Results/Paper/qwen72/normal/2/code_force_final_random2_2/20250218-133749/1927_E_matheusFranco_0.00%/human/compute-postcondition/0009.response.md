The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` was initially an integer value between 1 and 10^4 - 2, after decrementing by 1, `t` will now be an integer value between 0 and 10^4 - 3. The fact that `func_1()` has been called three times remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value between 0 and 10^4 - 3, `func_1()` has been called three times.**
