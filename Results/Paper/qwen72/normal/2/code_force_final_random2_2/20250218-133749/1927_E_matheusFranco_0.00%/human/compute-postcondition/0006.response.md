The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` was initially an integer value between 1 and 10^4 - 1, after decrementing, `t` will be an integer value between 0 and 10^4 - 2. The fact that `func_1()` has been called twice remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `func_1()` has been called twice.**
