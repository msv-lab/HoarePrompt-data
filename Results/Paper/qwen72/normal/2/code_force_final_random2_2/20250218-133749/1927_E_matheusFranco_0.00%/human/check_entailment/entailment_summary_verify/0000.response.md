Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1` exactly `t` times. This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Permutation Construction**: The function `func_1` constructs the permutation by placing values in a way that ensures the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. Let's break down the logic:
   - The permutation array `permutation` is initialized with zeros.
   - The variable `curr_v` is used to keep track of the current value to be placed in the permutation.
   - The outer loop iterates over the range `k`, and for each `i` in this range, the inner loop places the current value `curr_v` at positions that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i`.
   - This ensures that the values are distributed in a balanced manner across the permutation.

3. **Balanced Distribution**: The key to ensuring that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1 lies in the way the values are placed. By placing values at positions that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i`, the program ensures that the values are spread out evenly. This distribution method helps in balancing the sums of the segments.

4. **Output**: The constructed permutation is printed for each test case, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case and prints it. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
