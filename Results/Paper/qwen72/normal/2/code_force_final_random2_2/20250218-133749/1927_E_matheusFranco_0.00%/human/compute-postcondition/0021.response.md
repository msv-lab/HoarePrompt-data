Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i]` is set to `i // k + 1` for every multiple of `k` (i.e., `i % k == 0`), and remains 0 otherwise, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n // k + 1`, `i` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `multiples_of_k_plus_i = i` updates the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` to the current value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
