The code snippet `result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])` constructs a string `result` by converting each element of the list `permutation` to a string and joining them with a space.

- `permutation` is a list of length `n`, where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` are set to `i // k + 1`, and other elements are set to the next available value of `curr_v` in the sequence.
- `curr_v` is equal to `n + 1` after the loop completes.
- The loop variable `i` is equal to `k`.

After executing the given code snippet, the list `permutation` remains unchanged, but a new variable `result` is created, which is a string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces.

Output State: **`n` and `k` remain integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i]` is set to `i // k + 1` for every index `i` that is a multiple of `k` (i.e., `i % k == 0`), and for every index `i` that is not a multiple of `k`, `permutation[i]` is set to the next available value of `curr_v` in the sequence. The variable `curr_v` is equal to `n + 1` after the loop completes, the loop variable `i` is equal to `k`, and `result` is a string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces.**
