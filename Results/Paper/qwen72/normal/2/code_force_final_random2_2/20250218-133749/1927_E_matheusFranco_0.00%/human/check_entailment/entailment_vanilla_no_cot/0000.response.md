Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses a nested loop to fill the permutation list such that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - The outer loop iterates over the range `k`, and for each `i`, it fills the positions in the permutation list that are multiples of `k` plus `i` with consecutive integers starting from 1.
   - Finally, it prints the constructed permutation.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case, decrementing `t` after each call.

The logic in `func_1` ensures that the permutation is constructed in such a way that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` meet the required condition. The approach of filling the permutation in a specific pattern guarantees that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of these segments is at most 1, thus making the permutation k-level.
