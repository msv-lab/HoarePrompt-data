The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts no direct parameters but expects input in a structured format where:

- `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`.
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. However, the specific output or results for each test case are not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified in the given information.**
