Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit string converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `op` is 1, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the increment, `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]` after the increment, `b[ma]` is now `b[ma] + 1`.**
