To determine what will be printed by the `print(op)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
   - `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, where each element is a digit string converted to an integer.
   - The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
   - `num` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `num2` is an input integer.
   - `case` is the new input string.
   - `op` is the number of times the loop executed.
   - `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`.
   - `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2)`.
   - `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the loop started.
   - `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]` after the loop has completed.
   - `b[ma]` is now `b[ma] + op`.

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop modifies the value at index `ma` in the list `b` by adding `op` to it.
   - The value of `op` is the number of times the loop executed.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(op)` statement will print the value of `op`, which is the number of times the loop executed.

Given the initial state and the operations, the value of `op` is the number of iterations of the loop. Since the exact number of iterations is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe it in general terms.

Output: **op (where op is the number of times the loop executed)**
