The code snippet `b[ma] += 1` increments the value at the index `ma` in the list `b` by 1. Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` remains a list of integers extracted from the string `case`.
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- `num` remains greater than 0.
- `i` remains 0.
- `num2` remains an input integer and is less than or equal to 10000.
- `case` remains an input string.
- `op` remains 1.
- `b` remains a sorted version of the list `a`.
- `ma` remains set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd.
- `median` remains the element at index `ma` in the list `b` before the increment.
- `new_median` was the element at index `ma` in the list `b` before the increment, but now it is the element at index `ma` in the list `b` after the increment, which is `median + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer and is less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 1, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b` before the increment, `new_median` is `median + 1`.**
