Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit string converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]`, `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]`.
Code of the loop:
while new_median <= median:
    b[ma] += 1
    op += 1
    b = sorted(b)
    new_median = b[ma]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit string converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `op` is 1, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the increment, `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]` after the increment, `b[ma]` is now `b[ma] + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit string converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `op` is 2, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the increment, `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]` after the increment, `b[ma]` is now `b[ma] + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit string converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `op` is 3, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the increment, `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]` after the increment, `b[ma]` is now `b[ma] + 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
