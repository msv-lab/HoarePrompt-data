The code snippet `a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]` processes the string `case` to extract and convert all digit strings into integers, storing them in the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5
- `num` is greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is the new input string
- `op` is 0

After executing the code:
- `a` is now a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit string converted to an integer.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, `op`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit string converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `op` is 0.**
