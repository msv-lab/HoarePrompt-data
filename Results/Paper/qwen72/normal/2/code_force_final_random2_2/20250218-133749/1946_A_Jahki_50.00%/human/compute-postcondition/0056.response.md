The code snippet `new_median = b[ma]` assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. Since `b[ma]` was previously set to `median + 1`, `new_median` will now be equal to `median + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `op` is 1, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]`, `new_median` is `median + 1`, `b[ma]` is now `median + 1`.**
