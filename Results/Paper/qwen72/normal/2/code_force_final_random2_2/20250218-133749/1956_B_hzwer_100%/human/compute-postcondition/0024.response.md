Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with all elements set to 0, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes `cnt` as a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0.
- The initial state of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `ans` remains unchanged.
- The new state of `cnt` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`.
