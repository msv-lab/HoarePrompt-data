Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: The list of integers read from the input. It remains unchanged as the loop only reads from `a` but does not modify it.
- **`cnt`**: After the loop completes, `cnt[i]` will contain the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. This is because the loop increments `cnt[x]` for each `x` in `a`.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` is calculated as the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`. This means that for each index `i` in `cnt`, if `cnt[i]` is greater than 1, it contributes `cnt[i] - 1` to the sum. If `cnt[i]` is 0 or 1, it contributes 0 to the sum.
