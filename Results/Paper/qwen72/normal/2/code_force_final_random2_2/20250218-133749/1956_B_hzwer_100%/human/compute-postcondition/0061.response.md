Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`.
- `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `cnt`**:
   - `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - Each element at index `i` in `cnt` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.

2. **Calculating `ans`**:
   - For each element `x` in `cnt`, we compute `max(0, x - 1)`.
   - This means if `x` is greater than 1, we subtract 1 from it; otherwise, we take 0.
   - We then sum these values to get `ans`.

3. **What `ans` Represents**:
   - `ans` is the sum of the counts of elements in `a` that appear more than once, minus one for each such element.
   - In other words, it counts how many elements in `a` have duplicates, but only counts each duplicate once.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of max(0, x - 1) for all elements x in cnt, and cnt is a list of length n + 1 where each element at index i is the count of occurrences of i in a)**
