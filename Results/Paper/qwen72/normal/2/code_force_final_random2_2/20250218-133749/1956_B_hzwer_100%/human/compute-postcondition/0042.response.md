Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that has been fully iterated, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`, and the loop has not yet completed the number of iterations specified by the input.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to the new input integer.
- The initial state specifies that `n` was already an input integer greater than 0, but this line of code reassigns `n` to a new input integer.
- All other variables (`t`, `a`, `cnt`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The loop status (not yet completed) remains the same.
