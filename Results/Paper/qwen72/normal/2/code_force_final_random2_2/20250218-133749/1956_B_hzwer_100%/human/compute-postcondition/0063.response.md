The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but is expected to process input data that includes the number of test cases `t`, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, the number of cards `n` each player receives, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. Additionally, for each test case, there is a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the numbers on the cards in your hand, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the sequence. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function processes this input and returns a result for each test case. However, the specific output for each test case is not explicitly defined in the given information.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of cards with specific numbers, and returns a result for each test case.**
