The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `cnt`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `cnt`. If there are elements left in `cnt`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` was the last element processed from `cnt`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `cnt` needs to be considered as the new value of `x`.

Since `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1`, if the loop has not finished, there must be at least one more element in `cnt` to process. Therefore, the next value of `x` will be the next element in `cnt`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `ans` is `ans + max(0, x - 1)`, `x` is the next element in `cnt`**
