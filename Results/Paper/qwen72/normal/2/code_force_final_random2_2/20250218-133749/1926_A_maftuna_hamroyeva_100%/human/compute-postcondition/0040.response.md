The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Depending on the value of `j`, `l` was initially either 0 or 2. If `j` is 'A', `l` was 2 and is now 3. If `j` is not 'A', `l` was 0 and is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, `i` is 1, `a` is a string with at least 3 characters, `j` is the third character of `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 3 and `h` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 1 and `h` is 2.**
