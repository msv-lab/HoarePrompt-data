Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. It then counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string and prints the letter that appears most frequently. The logic and flow of the program are correct and match the requirements of the problem statement.
