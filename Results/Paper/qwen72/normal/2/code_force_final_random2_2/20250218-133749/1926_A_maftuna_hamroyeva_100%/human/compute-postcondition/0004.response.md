Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string, `l` is 0, `h` is 0.** 

The variable `h` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the new variable `h` which is set to 0.
