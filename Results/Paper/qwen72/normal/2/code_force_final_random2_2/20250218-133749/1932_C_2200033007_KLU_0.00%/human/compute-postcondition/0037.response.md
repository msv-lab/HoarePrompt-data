Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. `n` and `m` are positive integers with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4. `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The function returns a list `ans` containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in their original order.**
