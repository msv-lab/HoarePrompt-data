Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is an empty list, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if s[i] == 'L':
        b.append(a[l])
        l += 1
    else:
        b.append(a[r])
        r -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If the first character of the string `s` is 'L', the element at index `l + 1` from list `a` has been appended to list `b`. Otherwise, the character at index 0 of `s` is not 'L', and `b` now contains the element at index `r` of `a`, with `r` being decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `s[i] == 'L'`, `b` now includes the element `a[l-1]` as its last element, and `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b` has one additional element which is `a[r+1]`, and `r` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `s[i] == 'L'`, `b` now includes the element `a[l-1]` as its last element, and `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b` has one additional element which is `a[r+1]`, and `r` is decremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
