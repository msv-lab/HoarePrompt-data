The code snippet `b.append(a[l])` appends the element at index `l` from list `a` to list `b`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `a`, `b`, or `l`. Therefore, we can only describe the changes in terms of these variables.

- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `i` remains 1.
- The list `b` now contains one additional element, which is the element at index `l` from list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` now includes the element `a[l]` as its last element.**
