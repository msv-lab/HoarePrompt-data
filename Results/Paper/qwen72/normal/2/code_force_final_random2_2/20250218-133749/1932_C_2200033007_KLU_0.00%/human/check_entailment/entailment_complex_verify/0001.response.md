### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the commands and compute the required remainders.

3. **Processing Commands:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements being removed.
   - It also initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost indices of the array `a`.
   - For each command in the string `s`:
     - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements `r`.

4. **Computing Remainders:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the remainders.
   - It also initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will be used to compute the product of the elements.
   - It iterates over the elements in `b` in reverse order, multiplying `p` by each element and appending the result to `ans`.
   - However, the original code does not take the modulus `m` at each step of the product calculation. This can lead to overflow issues and incorrect results, especially for large values of `n` and `m`.

5. **Output:**
   - The main loop prints the results of `func_1` for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Product Calculation:**
  - The program does not take the modulus `m` at each step of the product calculation. This can lead to overflow issues and incorrect results, especially for large values of `n` and `m`.

### Corrected Code:
To fix the issue, we need to take the modulus `m` at each step of the product calculation.

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = (p * v) % m
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)
```

### Final Correctness:
- The corrected code ensures that the product is taken modulo `m` at each step, preventing overflow and ensuring the correct remainders are computed.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the product calculation and provided a corrected version of the code. The corrected code addresses the overflow issue and ensures the correct remainders are computed.

Final: **True**
