Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in the original order (not reversed).** 

Explanation: The variable `ans` initially contains the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order. The `reversed(ans)` function call reverses this list, effectively returning the cumulative products in the original order.
