Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `b` must contain at least one element, `ans` is a list containing the value `p * v`, `p` is `p * v`, `v` is the last element of `b`**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(p)` adds the current value of `p` to the list `ans`.
- Since `p` is already defined as `p * v`, where `v` is the last element of `b`, the value added to `ans` is `p * v`.
- The other variables (`i`, `l`, `r`, `b`, and `v`) remain unchanged.
- The list `ans` now contains one element, which is the value of `p * v`.
