Reasoning:  

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Specifically, the issue lies in how the program processes the commands and calculates the product modulo `m`.

1. **Product Calculation**: The program should calculate the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` before each command is executed and then take the remainder when divided by `m`. However, the program incorrectly appends the elements from `a` to `b` without calculating the product modulo `m` at each step.

2. **Order of Operations**: The program should output the product modulo `m` before removing an element from the array. Instead, it appends the elements to `b` and then calculates the cumulative product in reverse order, which is not what the problem requires.

3. **Final Output**: The program returns the cumulative products in reverse order, which is incorrect. The output should be the product modulo `m` at the start of each command, not the cumulative product.

To fix this, the program should:

- Calculate the product modulo `m` before each command.
- Remove the appropriate element from the array based on the command.
- Append the result of the product modulo `m` to the output list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the product modulo m before removing an element
        product = (product * a[l]) % m if s[i] == 'L' else (product * a[r]) % m
        b.append(product)
        # Remove the appropriate element
        if s[i] == 'L':
            l += 1
        else:
            r -= 1
    return b
```

Given the issues with the original program, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
