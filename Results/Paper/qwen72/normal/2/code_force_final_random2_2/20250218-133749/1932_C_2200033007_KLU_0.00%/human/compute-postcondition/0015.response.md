The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `b` remain unchanged. Since `b` has one additional element which is `a[r]`, and `r` is now reduced by 1, the new value of `r` is `r - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` has one additional element which is `a[r+1]`, `r` is `r - 1`.**
