Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If the first character of the string `s` is 'L', the element at index `l + 1` from list `a` has been appended to list `b`. Otherwise, the character at index 0 of `s` is not 'L', and `b` now contains the element at index `r` of `a`, with `r` being decremented by 1.***
