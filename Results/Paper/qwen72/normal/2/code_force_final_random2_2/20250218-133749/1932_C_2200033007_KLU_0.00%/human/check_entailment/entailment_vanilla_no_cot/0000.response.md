Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the remainder of the product of the remaining elements of the array `a` at each step, but the implementation only appends the elements being removed to the list `b` and then calculates the cumulative product of these elements in reverse order. This does not match the required behavior.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the product of the remaining elements
        for j in range(l, r + 1):
            product = (product * a[j]) % m
        b.append(product)
        
        # Remove the element based on the command
        if s[i] == 'L':
            l += 1
        else:
            r -= 1
        
        # Reset product for the next iteration
        product = 1
    
    return b
```

This corrected version ensures that the product of the remaining elements is calculated and the remainder is taken at each step before removing the specified element. The product is reset for each command to ensure the correct calculation for the next step.
