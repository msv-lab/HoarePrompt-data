Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n - 1`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, and `b` contains all elements from `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s`. If `s[i] == 'L'`, the element at index `l - 1` from `a` is appended to `b` and `l` is incremented by 1. If `s[i] == 'R'`, the element at index `r` from `a` is appended to `b` and `r` is decremented by 1. The final state of `b` will be a permutation of the elements in `a` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`.**
