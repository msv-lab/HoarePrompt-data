The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `password`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the remaining characters in `password`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` was the current character being processed, and `password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more character left in `password` to process. The next character in `password` will become the new value of `char`.

State: **`password` is a string of length n-1 (1 ≤ n-1 ≤ 19) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the next character in `password`**
