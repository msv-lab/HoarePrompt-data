Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Separation of Digits and Letters**: The function correctly separates the digits and letters from the password into two lists, `digits` and `letters`.
   - **Sorting**: The digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - **Validation of Sorted Digits**:
     - The function checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order. This is done by iterating through the `digits` list and ensuring that each digit is not greater than the next one.
   - **Validation of Digits After Letters**:
     - The function checks if any digit appears after a letter. This is done by comparing the last digit in the `digits` list with each letter in the `letters` list. If any digit is greater than any letter, the function returns `False`.
   - **Reconstruction and Comparison**:
     - The function reconstructs the password by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists and compares it with the original password. If they match, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the password consists of only digits or only letters correctly.
   - The function also handles the case where the password is empty (though the problem guarantees that the length is between 1 and 20).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" if the password is strong and "NO" otherwise, which aligns with the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to validate the strength of the passwords according to the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
