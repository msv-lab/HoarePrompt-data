Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The `digits` list contains all the digits from the `password` sorted in ascending order. The `letters` list contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(digits)):
    if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
        return False
    if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
        return False


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` sorted in ascending order and must have at least 1 digit, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` sorted in ascending order, `i` is 0, and either `i` is equal to or greater than `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is less than or equal to `digits[i + 1]`. Additionally, either `i` is greater than or equal to `len(letters)` or `digits[-1]` is less than or equal to `letters[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` sorted in ascending order and must have at least 1 digit. `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` sorted in ascending order. `i` is 1, and either `i` is equal to or greater than `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is less than or equal to `digits[i + 1]`. Additionally, either `i` is greater than or equal to `len(letters)` or `digits[-1]` is less than or equal to `letters[i]`. If `i` is less than `len(letters)` and `digits[-1]` is greater than `letters[i]`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` sorted in ascending order and must have at least 1 digit. `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` sorted in ascending order. `i` is 2, and either `i` is equal to or greater than `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is less than or equal to `digits[i + 1]`. Additionally, either `i` is greater than or equal to `len(letters)` or `digits[-1]` is less than or equal to `letters[i]`. If `i` is less than `len(letters)` and `digits[-1]` is greater than `letters[i]`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
