The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the length of the `digits` list (`len(digits)`). For the loop to execute, `len(digits)` must be greater than 0. This means that the `digits` list must contain at least one element. The variable `i` should start at 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `digits` is not empty and `i` starts at 0.

State: **`password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` sorted in ascending order and must have at least 1 digit, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` sorted in ascending order, `i` is 0**
