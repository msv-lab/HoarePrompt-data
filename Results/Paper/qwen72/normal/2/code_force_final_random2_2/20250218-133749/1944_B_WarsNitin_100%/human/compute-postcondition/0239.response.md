Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `ans1` now contains the elements at index 2 and index 2 of list `b`, `k` is `k - 2`.** 

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 2, so the new value of `k` is `k - 2`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `ans1`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
