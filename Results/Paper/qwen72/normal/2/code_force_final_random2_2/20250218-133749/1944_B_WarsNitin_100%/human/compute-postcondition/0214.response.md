Postcondition: ***`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `l` is either `[b[0]]` if `b[0] != b[1]` or remains an empty list otherwise, `ans1` and `ans2` are empty lists, `k` is `2 * (req - 2 * m - len(l))`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `req` is `2 * (req - 2 * m - len(l))`, `q` is `t`, `t` must be greater than `t - 1`, and `n` and `k` are input integers.***
