Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `b[1]` is equal to `b[0]`, `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` and `b[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Since `i` is 1, the value `b[1]` is appended to `ans1`. Initially, `ans1` contained the value of `b[1]`, so now `ans1` contains two instances of `b[1]`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
