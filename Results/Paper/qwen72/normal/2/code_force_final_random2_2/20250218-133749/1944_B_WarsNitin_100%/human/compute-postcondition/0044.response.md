Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `b[2]` equals `b[1]`, `ans1` now includes the elements `b[2]` and `b[2]`, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `k` was 0 before, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[2]` does not equal `b[1]`, `l` contains `b[2]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
