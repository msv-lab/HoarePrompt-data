Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `l` contains all its original elements, `ans1` contains all elements from `l` appended once, `k` is now equal to `req - 2 * m - len(l)`, `ans2` contains all elements from `l` appended once, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `req` is unchanged, `q` is `t`, `t` must be greater than `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are input integers.**
