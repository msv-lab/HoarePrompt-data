The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters. These parameters include:

- `t`: A positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50000).
  - `k`: An integer (1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋).
  - `a`: A list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.

Given these parameters, the function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input values. However, the specific output for each test case is not clearly defined in the provided information. Assuming the function is designed to solve a problem related to the given parameters, the output could be a list of results, one for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three parameters: an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input values.**
