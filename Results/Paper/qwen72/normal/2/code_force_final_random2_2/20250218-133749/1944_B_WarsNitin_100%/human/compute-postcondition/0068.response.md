Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `k` is 0, and `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is set to -2, and `ans2` contains the values of `c[0]`, `c[1]`, and `c[2]`. If `k` is 0, and `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` contains the values of `c[0]`, `c[1]`, and `c[2]`. In either case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is not 0, the values of `k` and `ans2` remain unchanged.**
