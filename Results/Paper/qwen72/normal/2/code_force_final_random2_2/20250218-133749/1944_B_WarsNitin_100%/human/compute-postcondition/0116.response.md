The code `l.append(b[n - 1])` appends the element at index `n - 1` of the list `b` to the list `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `len(l) - 1`
- `ans1` is an empty list
- `ans2` is an empty list
- `k` is `2 * max(0, k - len(l))`
- `q` is `t`
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers from the input
- `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order
- `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order
- `req` is `k`
- If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`. Otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.

After executing the code:
- The list `l` now contains the element at index `n - 1` of the list `b`.
- The length of `l` is increased by 1.
- The value of `i` is updated to `len(l) - 1`, which is now `len(l) - 1` (since `l` has one more element).

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is `2 * max(0, k - len(l))`, `q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `req` is `k`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` and the element at index `n - 1` of `b`.**
