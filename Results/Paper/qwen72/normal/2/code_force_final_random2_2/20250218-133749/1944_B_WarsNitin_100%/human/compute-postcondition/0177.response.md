Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `ans1` contains elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, each appended twice, `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, up to the last iteration, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged. If `c[3] == c[2]`, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[3]` in addition to any previous values, and `k` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
