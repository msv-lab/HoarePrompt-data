Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end.** 

Explanation: The code `b.sort()` sorts the list `b` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `c` remain unchanged. The only change is that `b` is now a sorted version of its original content.
