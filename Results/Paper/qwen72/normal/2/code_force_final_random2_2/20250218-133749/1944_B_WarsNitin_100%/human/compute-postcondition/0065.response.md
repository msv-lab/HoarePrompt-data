The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is -2, and `ans2` contains the value of `c[0]` and `c[1]`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, the values of `k` and `ans2` remain unchanged.**
