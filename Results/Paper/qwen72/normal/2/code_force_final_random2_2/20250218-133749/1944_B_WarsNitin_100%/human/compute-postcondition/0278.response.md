To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects in the loop head: `i` and `l`.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is the same as the initial `n`
- `k` is `req - 2 * num_pairs`
- `ans2` contains each element from `c` that was found to be equal to its preceding element, appended twice.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(len(l)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `len(l)` is greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, regardless of its value before the loop.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, `l` must have at least one element.
- The value of `i` before the loop starts does not affect the loop's execution because it is reset to 0 at the start of the loop.

### Final State:
- `i` is 0 (reset by the loop)
- `l` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `l` must have at least one element**
