Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[2]` equals `b[1]`, `ans1` now includes the elements `b[2]` and `b[2]`, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `b[2]` does not equal `b[1]` and `b[2]` is not equal to `b[3]`, `l` now includes the element `b[2]`.***
