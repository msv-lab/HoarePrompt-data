Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as the initial `n`. If `k` is 0, the loop has broken early. Otherwise, `k` has been decremented by 2 for each pair of consecutive equal elements found in `b` between indices 1 and `n-2`. `ans1` contains the elements from `b` that were found to be equal to their preceding element, each appended twice. `l` contains the elements from `b` that are not equal to their preceding or following element, excluding the first and last elements of `b`. `k` is now equal to `req`.**
