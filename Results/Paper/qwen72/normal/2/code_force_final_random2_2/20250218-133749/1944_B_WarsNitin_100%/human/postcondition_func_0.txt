The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function splits the list `a` into two halves, sorts them, and then selects elements based on specific conditions to form two lists `ans1` and `ans2`. These lists are printed as the output for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed, and the results have been printed.
