Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[3]` is equal to `b[2]`, `ans1` now includes the element at index 3 of `b`, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `b[3]` is not equal to `b[2]`, `l` now contains the element `b[3]`. If `b[3]` is equal to `b[4]`, `l` remains unchanged.***
