Postcondition: ***`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `ans1` is a list that may contain the `n-1`th element of `b` appended once or twice depending on the condition, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is `2 * max(0, k - len(l))` (decreased by 2 if the else part is executed), `q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `req` is `k`. If `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` followed by `b[n - 1]`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, or remains an empty list.***
