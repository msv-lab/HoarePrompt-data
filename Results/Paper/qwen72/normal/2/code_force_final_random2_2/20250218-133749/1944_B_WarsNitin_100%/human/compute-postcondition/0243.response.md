The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 3), and `n` must still be greater than 3 to ensure that `i < n - 1`.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
