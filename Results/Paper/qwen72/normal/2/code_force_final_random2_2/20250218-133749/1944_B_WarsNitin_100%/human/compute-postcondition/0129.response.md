Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, if `k` is -2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `b[1]` is equal to `b[0]`, `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` and `b[1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 2, so if `k` was initially 0, it is now -2. The other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. If `k` is -2, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
