The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` from list `b` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 2, the element `b[2]` is appended to `ans1`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `ans1` now includes the elements `b[2]` and `b[2]`.**
