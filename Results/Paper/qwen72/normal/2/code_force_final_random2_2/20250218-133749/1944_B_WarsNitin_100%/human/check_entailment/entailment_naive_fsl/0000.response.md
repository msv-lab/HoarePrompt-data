Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has issues with how it handles the selection of elements for the arrays `l` and `r`. Specifically, the logic for selecting elements from the sorted halves of the array `b` and `c` does not guarantee that the resulting arrays `ans1` and `ans2` will have the same length or that their bitwise XOR will be equal.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2
1 2
```

**Actual Output:**
The program might produce:
```
1 2
1 3
```
or another incorrect combination where the lengths of `ans1` and `ans2` are not equal or their bitwise XOR values do not match.

The issue arises because the program does not correctly handle the selection of elements to ensure that the resulting arrays meet the required conditions. Specifically, the logic for appending elements to `ans1` and `ans2` is flawed, leading to potential mismatches in the lengths and XOR values of the arrays.
