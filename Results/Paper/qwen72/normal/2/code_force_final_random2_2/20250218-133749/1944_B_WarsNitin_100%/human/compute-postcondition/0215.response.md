Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `l` is either `[b[0], b[n-1]]` if `b[0] != b[1]` or `[b[n-1]]` if `b[0] == b[1]`, `ans1` and `ans2` are empty lists, `k` is `2 * (req - 2 * m - len(l))`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `req` is `2 * (req - 2 * m - len(l))`, `q` is `t`, `t` must be greater than `t - 1`, and `n` and `k` are input integers.**

Explanation:
- The code `l.append(b[n - 1])` appends the element `b[n - 1]` to the list `l`.
- If `b[0] != b[1]`, `l` was initially `[b[0]]`, so after appending `b[n - 1]`, `l` becomes `[b[0], b[n-1]]`.
- If `b[0] == b[1]`, `l` was initially an empty list, so after appending `b[n - 1]`, `l` becomes `[b[n-1]]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
