Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `b[2]` equals `b[1]`, `ans1` now contains the elements at index 2 and index 2 of list `b`, and `k` is `k - 2`. If `b[2]` does not equal `b[1]`, `l` now contains the element `b[2]` appended to its previous contents. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
