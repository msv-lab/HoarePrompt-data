The only variable in the loop head is `kp`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `kp` relative to the user input converted to an integer. At the end of the last iteration, `kp` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `kp` must be incremented by 1, and the user input (converted to an integer) must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final user input. If `r` is '>', `prev` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `prev` is the last index `i` where `r` was '>', or 0 if no `r` was ever '>' during the loop. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called, which ensures that any buffered output is written to the terminal or file immediately.**
