Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^3.
- `kp` is 0.
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `v2` is 2.
- `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, the variables retain their initial values.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Let's break down the values of the variables used in the `print` statement:
- `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is 2.

Therefore, the `print` statement will substitute these values into the formatted string.

Output: **? 0 0 2 2**
