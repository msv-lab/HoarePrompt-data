The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all output is written immediately. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input. If `r` is '>', `prev` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop.**
