Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is the new user input, `prev` is the last index `i` where `r` was '>', or 0 if no `r` was ever '>' during the loop. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` remains '<'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `v2 = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `v2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
