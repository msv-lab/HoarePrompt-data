To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the variables that appear in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `kp` is 2
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is `n-1`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `v2` is `n-1`
- `r` is the final user input, `prev` is 0
- The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called
- If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` remains '<'

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 (since `range(1, n)` will generate a sequence from 1 to `n-1`).
- The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 until it reaches `n-1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
- The initial value of `i` is set by the loop, so we don't need to adjust it manually.

### Final State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `kp` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is `n-1`
- `i` is 1 (set by the loop)
- `v2` is `n-1`
- `r` is the final user input, `prev` is 0
- The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called
- If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` remains '<'

### State:
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final user input, `prev` is 0, the `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called, if `r` is '<', the current value of `r` remains '<'**
