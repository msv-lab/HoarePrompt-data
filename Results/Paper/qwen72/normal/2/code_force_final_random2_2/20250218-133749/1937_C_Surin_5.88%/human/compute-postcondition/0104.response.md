Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final user input. If `r` is '>', `prev` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `prev` is the last index `i` where `r` was '>', or 0 if no `r` was ever '>' during the loop. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called, which ensures that any buffered output is written to the terminal or file immediately.**

Explanation: The code snippet `g = 0` sets the variable `g` to 0. Since `g` was already initialized to 0 in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
