Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final user input. If `r` is '>', `prev` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `prev` is the last index `i` where `r` was '>', or 0 if no `r` was ever '>' during the loop.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer between 1 and 10^3.
- **`kp`**: Remains 1.
- **`n`**: Must be greater than 1, as the loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`.
- **`g`**: Remains 0.
- **`v1`**: Remains `n-1`.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`.
- **`v2`**: Remains `n-1`.
- **`r`**: This is the final user input received during the last iteration of the loop.
- **`prev`**: 
  - If `r` is '>' in the last iteration, `prev` will be `n-1`.
  - If `r` is not '>' in the last iteration, `prev` will be the last index `i` where `r` was '>', or 0 if no `r` was ever '>' during the loop.
