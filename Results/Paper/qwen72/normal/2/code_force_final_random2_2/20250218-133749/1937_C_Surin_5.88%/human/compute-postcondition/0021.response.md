The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 3, `v2` is 2, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, all variables retain their initial values.**
