Based on the initial state provided:

- `v1` is explicitly set to 2.
- `v2` is explicitly set to 3.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

This statement will print a formatted string where the placeholders `{v1}` and `{v2}` are replaced with their respective values.

Given the values:
- `v1` = 2
- `v2` = 3

The output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
