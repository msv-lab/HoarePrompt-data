To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because `range(1, n)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `kp` is 0
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is `n-1`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `v2` is `n-1`
- `r` is the user input
- `prev` is 0

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, and `i` should be set to 1 for the first iteration.

Since `n` is already given as a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. However, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1 for the loop to start correctly.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input, `prev` is 0**
