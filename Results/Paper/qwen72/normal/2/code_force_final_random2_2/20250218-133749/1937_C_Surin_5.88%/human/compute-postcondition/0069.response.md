Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` is the user input integer and must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, `r` is the user input, `prev` is `n-1` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` is '<'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is 2) to `v1`. Therefore, `v1` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
