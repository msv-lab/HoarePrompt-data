Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new user input, `prev` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `prev = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this update to `prev` while keeping all other initial conditions intact.
