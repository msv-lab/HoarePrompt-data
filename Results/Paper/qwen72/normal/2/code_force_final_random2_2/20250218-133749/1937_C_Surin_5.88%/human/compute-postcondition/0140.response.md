The code snippet `r = input()` assigns the user input to the variable `r`. This changes the value of `r` from its initial state (which was the user input) to the new user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new user input, `prev` is 0, and the `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called.**
