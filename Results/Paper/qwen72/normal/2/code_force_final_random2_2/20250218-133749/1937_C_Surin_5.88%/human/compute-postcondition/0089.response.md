The provided code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the standard output buffer, which ensures that all output is written immediately. This operation does not change the values of any variables in the program.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input, and `prev` is 1 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0.**
