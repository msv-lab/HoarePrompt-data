The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` updates the value of `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to it. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `sumo` was initially 0.
- `i` is `bets - 1`.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the user's input.
- `a[i]` refers to the last element in the slice of `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]`.

The value of `sumo` is updated to be the sum of its previous value (which was 0) and the integer value of `a[i]`. Therefore, `sumo` is now equal to `int(a[i])`.

The rest of the variables (`t`, `n`, `k_1` to `k_n`, `T`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` remain integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is `T + 1`, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is now a list of integers read from the user's input, `prod` is the product of the elements `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is `int(a[i])`, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated string representations of the elements `a[bets-1]` down to `a[0]` if `sumo` is less than `prod`, and `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`.**
