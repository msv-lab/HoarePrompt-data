The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` updates the value of `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to it. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50
- `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20
- `T` is 0
- `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `a` is a list of integers read from the user's input
- `prod` is now equal to the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`
- `i` is `bets - 1`
- `sumo` is 0
- `a[i]` is now equal to `prod // a[i]`

The value of `a[i]` is already updated to `prod // a[i]`. The code snippet adds this value to `sumo`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the user's input, `prod` is now equal to the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is now equal to `prod // a[i]`, `a[i]` is now equal to `prod // a[i]`.**
