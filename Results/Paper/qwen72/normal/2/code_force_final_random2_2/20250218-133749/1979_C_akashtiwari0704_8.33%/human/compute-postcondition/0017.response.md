Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the user's input, `prod` is now equal to the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `i` is `bets`, `sumo` is now equal to `prod // a[bets - 1]`, `a[bets - 1]` is now equal to `prod // a[bets - 1]`, `a[i]` is now equal to `prod // a[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
