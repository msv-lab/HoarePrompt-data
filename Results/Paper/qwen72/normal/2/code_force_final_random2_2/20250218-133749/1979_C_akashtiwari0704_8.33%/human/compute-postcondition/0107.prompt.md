Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = 1
    for i in range(bets):
        prod *= a[i]
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` remain integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` remains 0, `bets` remains an integer input by the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the user's input but now each element `a[i]` for 0 ≤ i < bets is equal to `prod // a[i]` (where `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of the original `a`), `prod` remains the product of the first `bets` elements of the original `a`, `i` is `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is the sum of the new values of `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no further action is taken. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated string representations of the elements `a[bets-1]` down to `a[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` remain integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is `T + 1`, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is now a list of integers read from the user's input, `prod` is the product of the elements `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]`, `i` is `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of the elements `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]` after they have been updated to `prod // a[i]`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, `ans` remains a string containing the space-separated string representations of the elements `a[bets-1]` down to `a[0]` if `sumo` is less than `prod`. Otherwise, if `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is now a string containing all elements of `a` from the first to the `bets`-th element, each followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` remain integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is `T + 1` (or `T + 2` relative to the initial state before the last iteration), `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is now a list of integers where each element `a[i]` has been updated to `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `prod` is the product of all elements in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of the updated elements in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` from the first to the `bets`-th element, each followed by a space. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing all elements of the updated `a` list separated by spaces.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
