The code snippet multiplies the current value of `prod` by the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given that `i` is 1, `prod` will be updated to `a[0] * a[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the user's input, `prod` is now equal to `a[0] * a[1]`, `i` is 1, `bets` must be greater than 1.**
