The code `elements = line.split()` splits the string `line` into a list of substrings based on whitespace and assigns this list to the variable `elements`. Since the initial state specifies that `elements` is already a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` using whitespace, the code does not change the value of `elements`. However, it reaffirms that `elements` is a list of strings derived from `line`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, the input file has at least five lines, `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the next line (`line`) using whitespace as the delimiter.**
