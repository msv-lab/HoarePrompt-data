The value of `tot` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, but the condition about breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still valid.

Output State: **`num` remains a non-empty string, `tot` is now 3, `i` is now `len(num) - 3`. If `num[i]` is not '0', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
