You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, nums):

    tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'

#Function 2:
def zerocnts(num):
    num = str(num)
    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        tot += 1
    return tot



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, nums))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of integers in the list, m is a non-negative integer representing the parameter determining when Sasha wins, and nums is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, m, nums):
    tot = sum(len(val) for val in map(str, nums))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `tot` is the sum of the lengths of the string representations of the numbers in `nums` minus the sum of every second element starting from the first element of `cntvals`, `cntvals` is a list of the counts of zeros in each number in `nums`, sorted in descending order, and `i` is the last index processed by the loop, which is the largest even index less than or equal to the length of `cntvals` - 1.
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'
    #The program returns 'Sasha' if the sum of the lengths of the string representations of the numbers in `nums` minus the sum of every second element starting from the first element of `cntvals` (sorted in descending order) is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. Otherwise, it returns 'Anna'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer.
def zerocnts(num):
    num = str(num)
    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        
        tot += 1
        
    #State: `num` is a non-empty string, `tot` is the count of trailing zeros in `num`, `i` is the index of the first non-zero digit from the end of `num` or -1 if all digits are zero.
    return tot
    #The program returns the count of trailing zeros in the string `num`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it calculates the total number of digits (`tot`) and how it handles the zero counts (`cntvals`). Specifically, the function `func_1` incorrectly subtracts the zero counts from the total digit count, which does not accurately reflect the game's rules.

### Issue 1: Incorrect Handling of Zero Counts
The function `zerocnts` correctly counts the trailing zeros in a number, but the way these counts are used in `func_1` is incorrect. The function subtracts the largest zero counts from the total digit count, which does not simulate the actual game mechanics. In the game, Anna reverses the digits of a number, and Sasha concatenates two numbers. The zero counts do not directly affect the total number of digits in the final concatenated number.

### Issue 2: Incorrect Total Digit Calculation
The total digit count (`tot`) is calculated using the length of the string representation of each number. However, this does not account for the fact that reversing a number can change its length (e.g., reversing 100 results in 1, reducing the digit count).

### Example Case Where the Program Fails
Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
2 2
10 10
```
Expected Output:
```
Anna
```
Actual Output:
```
Sasha
```
Explanation:
- Anna can reverse either 10, resulting in 1.
- Sasha can concatenate 1 and 10, resulting in 110, which is less than \(10^2 = 100\).
- Therefore, Anna wins, but the program incorrectly outputs "Sasha".

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the game mechanics, leading to incorrect results in certain cases. Hence, the program is incorrect.
