The value of `tot` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the condition about breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is not affected by this code snippet, it remains valid.

Output State: **`num` is a non-empty string, `tot` is 2, `i` is `len(num) - 2`. If `num[i]` is not '0', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
