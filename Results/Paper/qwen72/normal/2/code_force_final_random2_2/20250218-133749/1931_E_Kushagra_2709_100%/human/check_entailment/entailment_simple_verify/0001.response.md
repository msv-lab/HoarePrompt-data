### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Anna and Sasha, who take turns manipulating a list of integers.
   - Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number.
   - Sasha concatenates two numbers and inserts the result back into the list.
   - The game ends when Sasha can no longer make a move, and the winner is determined by whether the final number is at least \(10^m\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The total number of digits in the list is crucial because each move affects the total digit count.
   - Anna's move does not change the total number of digits, but Sasha's move reduces the total number of digits by one.
   - The game ends when there is only one number left, and the winner is determined by the length of this final number.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(n, m, nums)`**:
     - It calculates the total number of digits in the list (`tot`).
     - It uses `zerocnts` to count trailing zeros in each number and sorts these counts in descending order.
     - It iterates over the sorted counts, subtracting the largest counts from `tot` in pairs.
     - Finally, it checks if the remaining total number of digits is at least \(m + 1\) to determine the winner.

   - **`zerocnts(num)`**:
     - Converts the number to a string and counts the trailing zeros.
     - Returns the count of trailing zeros.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic of counting trailing zeros and subtracting them in pairs is correct because Sasha's move effectively removes one digit from the total count.
   - The final check `return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'` is correct because it determines if the final number has at least \(m + 1\) digits.

5. **Annotated Code Validation:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the state variables are correctly managed and updated.
   - The loop that subtracts the trailing zeros in pairs ensures that the total digit count is reduced appropriately.
   - The final comparison `tot >= m + 1` correctly determines the winner based on the remaining digit count.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
