To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `num` is a non-empty string.
   - `tot` is 2.
   - `i` is `len(num) - 2`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `len(num) - 1` down to `0` (inclusive).
   - The loop condition is that `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(num) - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` should be `len(num) - 3`.

5. **Final State:**
   - `num` remains a non-empty string.
   - `tot` remains 2.
   - `i` is now `len(num) - 3`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`num` is a non-empty string, `tot` is 2, `i` is `len(num) - 3`**.
