Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it calculates the total number of digits (`tot`) and how it handles the zero counts (`cntvals`). Specifically, the function `func_1` incorrectly subtracts the zero counts from the total digit count, which does not accurately reflect the game's rules.

### Issue 1: Incorrect Handling of Zero Counts
The function `zerocnts` correctly counts the trailing zeros in a number, but the way these counts are used in `func_1` is incorrect. The function subtracts the largest zero counts from the total digit count, which does not simulate the actual game mechanics. In the game, Anna reverses the digits of a number, and Sasha concatenates two numbers. The zero counts do not directly affect the total number of digits in the final concatenated number.

### Issue 2: Incorrect Total Digit Calculation
The total digit count (`tot`) is calculated using the length of the string representation of each number. However, this does not account for the fact that reversing a number can change its length (e.g., reversing 100 results in 1, reducing the digit count).

### Example Case Where the Program Fails
Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
2 2
10 10
```
Expected Output:
```
Anna
```
Actual Output:
```
Sasha
```
Explanation:
- Anna can reverse either 10, resulting in 1.
- Sasha can concatenate 1 and 10, resulting in 110, which is less than \(10^2 = 100\).
- Therefore, Anna wins, but the program incorrectly outputs "Sasha".

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the game mechanics, leading to incorrect results in certain cases. Hence, the program is incorrect.
