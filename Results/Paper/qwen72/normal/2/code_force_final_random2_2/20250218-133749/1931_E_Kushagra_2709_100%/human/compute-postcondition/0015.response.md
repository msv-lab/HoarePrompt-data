Output State: **`num` is a non-empty string, `tot` is the count of trailing zeros in `num`, `i` is the index of the first non-zero digit from the end of `num` or -1 if all digits are zero.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from the last character of the string `num` to the first character (from right to left).
- For each iteration, if the current character is '0', `tot` is incremented, and the loop continues.
- If a non-zero character is encountered, the loop breaks.
- After all iterations, `tot` will hold the count of trailing zeros in `num`.
- The variable `i` will be the index of the first non-zero digit from the end of `num`, or -1 if all characters in `num` are '0'.
