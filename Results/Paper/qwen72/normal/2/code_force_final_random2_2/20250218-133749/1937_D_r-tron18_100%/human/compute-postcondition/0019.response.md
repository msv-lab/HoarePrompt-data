Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. If `ol` (which is `totalOne`) is less than or equal to `zr` (which is 0), then `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`, and all other variables remain unchanged. If `ol` is greater than `zr`, then `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, where `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0)`, and `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`. The variables `i`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr` retain their initial values.***
