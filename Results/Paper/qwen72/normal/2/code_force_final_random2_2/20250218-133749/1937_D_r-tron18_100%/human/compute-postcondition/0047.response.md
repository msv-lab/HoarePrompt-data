The code snippet `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the list `preOne`.

Let's analyze the impact:

- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0.
- The last element of `preOne` is removed, which means the list `preOne` now has one fewer element.

The other variables (`el`, `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `i`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `ans[i]`) are not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0 (with the last element removed), `i` is `n - 2`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`. Otherwise, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.**
