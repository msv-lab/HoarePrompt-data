To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the parameter `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the range `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` is non-empty. This means that `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to `-1`, which simplifies to `n` being greater than 0.
3. **Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to `n - 1`.

### Adjusting the States:

- **`n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
- **`i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to `n - 1`.

### Final State:

Given the initial state:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5.
- `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute:

State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
