#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing positions, and times is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= times <= len(arr).
def func_1(arr, times):
    n = len(arr)
    return arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)]
    #The program returns the difference between the last element in `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)` from the end of `arr`. Here, `arr` is a list of integers representing positions, and `times` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `times` <= len(`arr`). The value of `n` is the number of elements in `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `times` (where `0 <= times <= len(arr)`). It returns the difference between the last element in `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)` from the end of `arr`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. In other words, it calculates the difference between the last element and an element that is `times` positions before the last element, ensuring that the index does not go out of bounds.
