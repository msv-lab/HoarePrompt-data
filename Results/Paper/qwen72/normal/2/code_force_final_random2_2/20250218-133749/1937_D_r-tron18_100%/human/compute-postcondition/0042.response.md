To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables and Their Initial Values:**
   - `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`.
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `ol` is `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.
   - `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`.

2. **Evaluate the Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet calculates `oneInd` using the function `func_1` applied to `preOne` and `zr`, and `preOne` and `zr + 1`.
   - `oneInd` is the sum of these two function calls.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - The only variable that changes is `oneInd`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

4. **Calculate the Result:**
   - `oneInd` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`**.
