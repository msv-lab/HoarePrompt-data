To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`.
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `ol` is `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.
   - `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code snippet calculates the value of `oneInd` using the formula:
     ```python
     oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
     ```
   - `preOne[-1]` is the last element of the list `preOne`. Since `preOne` is a cumulative sum list starting from 0, `preOne[-1]` is the sum of all elements in `pre`.
   - `func_1(preOne, 1)` is a function call that we assume returns a value based on the input parameters. Without the definition of `func_1`, we cannot compute its exact value, but we can represent it symbolically.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - The only variable that changes is `oneInd`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State Calculation:

- `oneInd` is calculated as:
  ```python
  oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
  ```

### Final Output State:

Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`**.
