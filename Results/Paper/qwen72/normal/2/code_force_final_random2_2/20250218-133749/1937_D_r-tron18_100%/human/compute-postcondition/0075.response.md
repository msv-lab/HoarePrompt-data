Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `suffZero` is updated to include a new element which is the last element of `suffZero` plus `i + 1`.**

Explanation:
- `ol` is assigned the value of `totalOne`, which is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
- `zr` is assigned the value of `len(suffZero) - 1`, which is the length of the `suffZero` list minus 1.
- All other variables (`el`, `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `i`, and `suffZero`) remain unchanged, except that `suffZero` is updated to include a new element which is the last element of `suffZero` plus `i + 1`.
