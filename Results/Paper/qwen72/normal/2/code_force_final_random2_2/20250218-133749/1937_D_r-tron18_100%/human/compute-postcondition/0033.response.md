Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list [0, n], `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. If `zr` (which is `len(suffZero) - 1`) is less than or equal to `ol` (which is `totalOne`), then `ans[i]` is set to `2 * n - 1 - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1`, and `zeroInd` is `2 * n - 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. If `zr` is greater than `ol`, then `ans[n-1]` is set to `n - 2 * preOne[-1]`, and `zeroInd` is `n`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`. In both cases, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the character at index `n - 1` in `s1` and is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, and `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.***
