The code snippet assigns the value of `zeroInd - oneInd` to `ans[i]`. Let's break down the impact:

- `ans[i]` is updated with the value of `zeroInd - oneInd`.
- The value of `i` is `n - 3`.
- `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1_result`.

Since `i` is `n - 3`, the specific index in `ans` being updated is `n - 3`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1_result`, `ans[n - 3]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1_result)`**.
