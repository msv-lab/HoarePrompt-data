To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0.
   - `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `el` is the character at index `n - 1` in `s1` and `el` is '>'.
   - `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1` which is 0.
   - `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
   - `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The line `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd` updates the value of `ans[i]` to `zeroInd - oneInd`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

4. **Calculating `zeroInd` and `oneInd`:**
   - `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
   - `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

5. **Final Output State:**
   - `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`.
   - All other variables remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `ans[n-1]` which is `zeroInd - oneInd`, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.**
