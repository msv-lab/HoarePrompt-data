The code snippet updates the value of `x` based on the given formula: `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)
- `T` is greater than 1
- `t` is 2
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 2
- `i` is 2
- `suma` is 0
- `x` is `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1`. If \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\), then `suma` is `a`, `x` is `a`, and the current value of \(a - i * (i - 1)\) is greater than 0. Otherwise, `suma` remains 0 and `x` remains `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1`.

Let's calculate the new value of `x` using the given formula:

1. Calculate \(a - i * (i - 1)\):
   - Since `i` is 2, \(i * (i - 1) = 2 * 1 = 2\).
   - Therefore, \(a - i * (i - 1) = a - 2\).

2. Calculate \((a - 2) // i ** 2\):
   - Since `i` is 2, \(i ** 2 = 4\).
   - Therefore, \((a - 2) // 4\) is the integer division of \(a - 2\) by 4.

3. Add 1 to the result:
   - The new value of `x` is \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\).

Thus, the new value of `x` is \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\).

The output state is:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)
- `T` is greater than 1
- `t` is 2
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 2
- `i` is 2
- `suma` is 0
- `x` is \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\)

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `suma` is 0, `x` is \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\)**.
