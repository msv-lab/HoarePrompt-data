You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)

    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is `T-1`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for \(i\) from 1 to `b` if \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\), otherwise `x` is 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range for `j`**: The inner loop for `j` starts from 1, but the commented-out code suggests it should start from 4. This discrepancy indicates a potential misunderstanding of the problem constraints.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`**: The formula used to calculate `x` is:
   ```python
   x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
   ```
   This formula does not correctly account for the condition that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The formula seems to be derived incorrectly.

3. **Incorrect Summation**: The summation logic:
   ```python
   suma += x
   ```
   is not correctly handling the cases where the condition is met. The subtraction of 1 at the end:
   ```python
   print(suma - 1)
   ```
   is also arbitrary and not justified by the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), the program should output 1, but the current logic does not guarantee this.

To illustrate, let's consider the test case \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\):
- The correct output should be 1 because the pair (1, 1) satisfies the condition.
- However, the program's logic will not correctly compute this.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
