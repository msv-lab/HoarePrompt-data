You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import  math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.

                        print(i,j)"""
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        
        print(suma - 1)
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is `T-1`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for \(i\) from 1 to `b` if \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\), otherwise `x` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases, each containing two positive integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates a value based on a specific formula involving `a` and `b`, and prints the result. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the state of the program includes the number of test cases `T`, the current test case index `t`, the input values `a` and `b`, and the calculated sum `suma`. The function effectively processes each test case independently and outputs the result for each.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided code reads the number of test cases \(T\) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It initializes a variable `suma` to 0, which will store the count of valid pairs.
   - It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
   - If \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

3. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is used to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(i\).
   - This formula is derived from the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the derivation and correctness of this formula need to be verified.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is not immediately clear and seems to be an optimization or simplification of the original problem.
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) implies that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - Simplifying this, we get \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), which can be rewritten as \(a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b\).
   - This suggests that \(a\) must be of the form \(a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)\), where \(k\) is an integer.
   - The provided formula does not directly match this form, and the logic behind it is not clearly explained.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles multiple test cases correctly.
   - The input and output formats are followed as specified in the problem statement.
   - However, the core logic for counting valid pairs might be incorrect due to the unexplained formula.

### Conclusion:
Given the unclear and potentially incorrect formula used in the code, the program is likely incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
