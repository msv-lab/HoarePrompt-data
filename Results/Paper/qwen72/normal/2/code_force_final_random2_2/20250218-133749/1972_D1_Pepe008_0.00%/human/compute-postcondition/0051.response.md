The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `b`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `b` must remain at least 2 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `suma` is 0, `x` is `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1`. If \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\), then `suma` is `a`, `x` is `a`, and the current value of \(a - i * (i - 1)\) is greater than 0. Otherwise, `suma` remains 0 and `x` remains `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1`.**
