Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is \((a - 2 \times (2 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1\).**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `x` was \((a - 1 \times (1 - 1)) // 1\), which simplifies to \(a\).
- The new value of `x` is calculated as \((a - 2 \times (2 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1\), which simplifies to \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\).
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `suma`, `i`) remain unchanged.
