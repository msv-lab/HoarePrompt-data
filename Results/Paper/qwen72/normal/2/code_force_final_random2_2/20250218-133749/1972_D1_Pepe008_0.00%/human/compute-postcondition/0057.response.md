The code snippet `suma += x` updates the value of `suma` by adding the value of `x` to it. Let's break down the impact:

- `suma` was initially 0.
- `x` is calculated as \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
- Given `i` is 3, the expression for `x` becomes \((a - 3 \times 2) // 3^2 + 1\), which simplifies to \((a - 6) // 9 + 1\).

So, the new value of `suma` is `0 + ((a - 6) // 9 + 1)`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `suma` is \((a - 6) // 9 + 1\), `x` is \((a - 6) // 9 + 1\).**
