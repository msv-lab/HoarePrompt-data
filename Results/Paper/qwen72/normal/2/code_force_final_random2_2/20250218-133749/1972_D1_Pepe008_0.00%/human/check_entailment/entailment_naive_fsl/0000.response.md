Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range for `j`**: The inner loop for `j` starts from 1, but the commented-out code suggests it should start from 4. This discrepancy indicates a potential misunderstanding of the problem constraints.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`**: The formula used to calculate `x` is:
   ```python
   x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
   ```
   This formula does not correctly account for the condition that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The formula seems to be derived incorrectly.

3. **Incorrect Summation**: The summation logic:
   ```python
   suma += x
   ```
   is not correctly handling the cases where the condition is met. The subtraction of 1 at the end:
   ```python
   print(suma - 1)
   ```
   is also arbitrary and not justified by the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), the program should output 1, but the current logic does not guarantee this.

To illustrate, let's consider the test case \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\):
- The correct output should be 1 because the pair (1, 1) satisfies the condition.
- However, the program's logic will not correctly compute this.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
