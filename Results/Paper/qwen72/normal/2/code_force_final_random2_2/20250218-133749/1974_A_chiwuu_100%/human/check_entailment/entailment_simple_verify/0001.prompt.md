You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input (converted to integers), `t` is the final value computed based on the conditions inside the loop, and `t1` is the last computed value of `t * 15 - b * 4`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a` and `b`.

2. **Initial Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the initial number of screens required to fit all 2x2 icons. Since each screen can hold up to 3 (15 / 5) 2x2 icons, the calculation `t = b // 2 + (b % 2 != 0)` ensures that we account for any remaining icons that don't fit into a full screen.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the program calculates the remaining space on these screens for 1x1 icons. The formula `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` computes the total number of 1x1 cells available after placing the 2x2 icons.

4. **Fitting 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining space `t1` is sufficient to fit all 1x1 icons (`a`), the program does not need to add more screens.
   - If the remaining space is insufficient, the program calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. The formula `t2 = a - t1` computes the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed, and `t = t + t2 // 15 + (t2 % 15 != 0)` ensures that we account for any remaining icons that don't fit into a full screen.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis of Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where `a` or `b` are zero correctly.
- **Screen Calculation**: The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons is correct.
- **Additional Screens**: The logic for adding additional screens for remaining 1x1 icons is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all the necessary calculations and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
