Output State: **`a` is an integer (converted from its original string value), `b` is an integer (converted from its original string value), `t` is initially equal to `b // 2` if `b` is even, otherwise `t` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`.** 

Explanation: The code `b = int(b)` converts the string value of `b` to an integer. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
