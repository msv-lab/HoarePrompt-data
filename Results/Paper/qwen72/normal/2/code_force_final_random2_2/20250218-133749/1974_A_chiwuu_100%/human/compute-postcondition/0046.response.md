Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer (converted from its original string value), `b` is an integer (converted from its original string value), `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `t1` is equal to `b * 15 - b * 4`. If `t` (which is initially equal to `b`) is even, `t` is updated to `b // 2`. If `t` is odd, `t` is updated to `b // 2 + 1`.***
