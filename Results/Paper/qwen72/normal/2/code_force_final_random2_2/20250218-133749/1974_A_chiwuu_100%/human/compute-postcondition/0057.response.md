The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the description, it is implied that the function should accept parameters related to the number of test cases and the counts of different application icons. However, since the function signature does not include these parameters, we need to infer the intended functionality from the context.

Given the context:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, representing the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon, respectively.

The function likely processes these inputs and returns some result based on the counts of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `x` and `y`, where `x` represents the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `y` represents the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. The function returns a result for each test case based on these inputs.**
