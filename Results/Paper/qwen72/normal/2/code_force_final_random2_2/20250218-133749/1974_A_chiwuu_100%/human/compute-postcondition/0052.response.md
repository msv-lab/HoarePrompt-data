The code snippet `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1` modifies the value of `t`. To determine the new value of `t`, we need to consider the current value of `t` (which is not specified in the initial state) and the value of `t2`.

From the initial state:
- `t1` is `(7b / 2)` if `b` is even, or `(7b / 2 + 15)` if `b` is odd.
- `t2` is `a - t1`.

Let's break down the calculation:

1. **Calculate `t1`:**
   - If `b` is even, `t1 = 7b / 2`.
   - If `b` is odd, `t1 = 7b / 2 + 15`.

2. **Calculate `t2`:**
   - `t2 = a - t1`.

3. **Update `t`:**
   - `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1`.

Since `t` is not specified in the initial state, we will denote its initial value as `t_initial`.

### Calculation:
- If `b` is even:
  - `t1 = 7b / 2`
  - `t2 = a - (7b / 2)`
  - `t = t_initial + (a - (7b / 2)) // 15 + 1`

- If `b` is odd:
  - `t1 = 7b / 2 + 15`
  - `t2 = a - (7b / 2 + 15)`
  - `t = t_initial + (a - (7b / 2 + 15)) // 15 + 1`

### Output State:
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is an integer.
- `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `t1` is `(7b / 2)` if `b` is even, or `(7b / 2 + 15)` if `b` is odd.
- `t2` is `a - t1`.
- `t` is updated to `t_initial + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t1` is `(7b / 2)` if `b` is even, or `(7b / 2 + 15)` if `b` is odd, `t2` is `a - t1`, `t` is `t_initial + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.**
