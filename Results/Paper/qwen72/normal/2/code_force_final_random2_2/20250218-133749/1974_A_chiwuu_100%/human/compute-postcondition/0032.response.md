The line `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. All other variables remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `t` is equal to `b // 2` if `b` is even, otherwise `t` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is the second integer read from the input (now converted to an integer), and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`.**
