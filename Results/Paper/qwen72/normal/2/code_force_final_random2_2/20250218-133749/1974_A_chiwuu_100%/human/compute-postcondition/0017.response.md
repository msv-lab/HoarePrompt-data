Output State: **`t` is now `t + t2 // 15`, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`, and `t1` is less than `a`. If `t` was even, `t` is now equal to `b // 2`. If `t` was odd, `t` is now even and equal to `(t // 2) + 1`. Additionally, `t2` is divisible by 15.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged from the initial state.
