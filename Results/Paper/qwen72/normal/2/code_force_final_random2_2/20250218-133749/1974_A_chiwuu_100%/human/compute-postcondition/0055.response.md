Let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step to determine the value of `t` that will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` are integers where \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `t1` is calculated as follows:
  - If `b` is even, `t1 = (7b / 2)`.
  - If `b` is odd, `t1 = (7b / 2 + 15)`.
- If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, `t2` is set to `a - t1`.
- If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15)`.
- Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t_initial + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate `t1`:**
   - If `b` is even, `t1 = (7b / 2)`.
   - If `b` is odd, `t1 = (7b / 2 + 15)`.

2. **Check if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`:**
   - If `t1 >= a`, `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1 < a`, proceed to the next steps.

3. **Calculate `t2`:**
   - `t2 = a - t1`.

4. **Update `t` based on `t2`:**
   - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15)`.
   - Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t_initial + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.

### Final Output:
To determine the exact value of `t` that will be printed, we need to consider the initial value of `t` and the conditions described. Since the initial value of `t` is not explicitly given, we will assume it is `t_initial`.

Given the conditions:
- If `t1 >= a`, `t` remains `t_initial`.
- If `t1 < a`, `t` is updated based on the value of `t2`.

Let's summarize the possible outcomes:

1. **If `t1 >= a`:**
   - `t` remains `t_initial`.

2. **If `t1 < a`:**
   - `t2 = a - t1`.
   - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t_initial + (t2 // 15)`.
   - Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t_initial + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The value of `t` that will be printed depends on the values of `a`, `b`, and `t_initial`. Without specific values for these variables, we can only describe the logic that determines `t`.

Output: **t (where t is determined by the conditions described: if t1 >= a, t remains t_initial; otherwise, t is updated based on the value of t2 as described)**.
