Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t1` is `(7b / 2)` if `b` is even, or `(7b / 2 + 15)` if `b` is odd, `t` is unchanged.**

The code `t = t` does not change the value of `t`, so all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
