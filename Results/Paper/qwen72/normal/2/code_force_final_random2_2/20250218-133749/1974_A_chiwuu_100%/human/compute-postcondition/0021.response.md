Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t` was even, `t` is now equal to `b // 2`. If `t` was odd, `t` is now even and equal to `(t // 2) + 1`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, no further changes are made. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is set to `a - t1`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.***
