Output State: **`t` is now equal to `b` // 2, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is now an integer, and `t` is even.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to `t // 2`, which means `t` is now half of its previous value (integer division). Since `t` was initially even and equal to `b`, after the division, `t` remains an integer. All other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged. The condition that `t` is even is still valid after the division because dividing an even number by 2 results in another even number.
