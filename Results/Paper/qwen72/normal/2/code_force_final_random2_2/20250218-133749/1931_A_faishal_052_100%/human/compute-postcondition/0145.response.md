The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the constant `range` (which is set to 3), so we can only adjust `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being less than `range`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `range` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list that will eventually contain `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions as described, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[1][0] + 96`, `j` is 1, `range` is 3**
