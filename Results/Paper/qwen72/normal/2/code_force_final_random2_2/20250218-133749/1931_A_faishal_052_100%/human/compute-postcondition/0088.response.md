The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `cases` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `cases` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements both of which are the array `arr`, `j` is 2, and `arr` is sorted as follows: if `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex - 2]`; if `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`; if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`; if `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`**
