You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word. The function should output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded for each test case, each on a new line.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop have completed, `cases` will be an integer between 1 and 100, `i` will be equal to `cases - 1`, `info` will be a list containing `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr`. Each `arr` will contain three elements, where the first two elements are either 1 or 26 (depending on the value of `lex` during the iteration), and the third element is the remaining value of `lex` after the operations inside the loop. The exact values of the elements in each `arr` depend on the input values of `lex` provided during each iteration.
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have completed, `cases` remains an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is equal to `cases - 1`, `info` is a list containing `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions as described, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[cases-1][0] + 96`, `info[cases-1][1] + 96`, and `info[cases-1][2] + 96`, `j` is 2, and `range` is 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads from standard input a series of test cases. The first line of input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) is provided, representing an encoded value. The function processes each `n` to determine and print the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded, with each word printed on a new line. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the final state includes the variable `cases` holding the number of test cases, `info` containing a list of sorted arrays, each with three elements derived from the input, and `i` and `j` holding the last indices used in the loops.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic used to decode the encoded value into the lexicographically smallest word is flawed. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

- **Input:** `n = 55`
- **Expected Output:** `czz`
- **Actual Output:** `azz`

The program incorrectly assigns the first two characters as 'a' and 'z', which results in the word "azz" instead of the correct "czz".

To further illustrate, let's break down the logic:
1. The program checks if `lex` is less than 28, and if so, it appends 1 to the array and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
2. It then checks if `lex` is less than 52, and if so, it appends 26 to the array and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
3. Finally, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to the array and sorts it.

For `n = 55`:
- The first loop iteration will append 1 and subtract 1, making `lex = 54`.
- The second loop iteration will append 26 and subtract 26, making `lex = 28`.
- The third value will be 28, and the array will be `[1, 26, 28]`.
- After sorting, the array becomes `[1, 26, 28]`, which translates to "azz".

However, the correct output should be "czz", which can be achieved by assigning the values 3, 26, and 26 to the array, resulting in "czz".

Thus, the program does not handle this case correctly, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
