The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `cases`. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `cases` is an integer greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `cases` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list that will eventually contain `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions as described, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[0][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[0][2] + 96)`, `j` is 2**
