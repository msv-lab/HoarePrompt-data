Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer, and `arr` now contains the element 26 appended to its previous contents.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr.append(26)` appends the value 26 to the list `arr`.
- The initial state specifies that `arr` contains different elements based on the value of `lex`. However, regardless of the initial content of `arr`, the code appends 26 to it.
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `j`, and `lex`) remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the final state includes all the initial conditions plus the updated `arr` with the new element 26 appended.
