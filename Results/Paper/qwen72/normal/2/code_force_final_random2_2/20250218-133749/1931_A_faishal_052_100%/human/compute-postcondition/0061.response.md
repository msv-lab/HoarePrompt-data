Postcondition: ***`cases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 0, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` is between 2 (inclusive) and 26 (exclusive), `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` is greater than 52, `arr` is either an empty list if `lex` > 78 or contains the element 26 if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive).***
