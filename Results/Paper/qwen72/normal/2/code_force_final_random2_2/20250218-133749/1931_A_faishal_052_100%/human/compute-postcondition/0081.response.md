Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 2. If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, `arr` is `[26, 1, 26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[1]` and `lex` remains unchanged.***
