The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range value `3`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` being less than `3`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and it must still be less than 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is a list that will eventually contain `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions as described, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)` and `chr(info[0][1] + 96)`, `j` is 2**
