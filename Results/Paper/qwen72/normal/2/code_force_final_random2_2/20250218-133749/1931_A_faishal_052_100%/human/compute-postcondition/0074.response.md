The code snippet `arr.append(1)` appends the value `1` to the list `arr`. Based on the initial state, the value of `arr` before the operation could be `[26, 1]` or `[26, 26]` depending on the value of `lex`. After appending `1` to `arr`, the new value of `arr` will be `[26, 1, 1]` if `lex` was less than 28, between 28 and 52 (inclusive), or between 2 and 26 (exclusive), or `[26, 26, 1]` if `lex` was between 52 and 78 (inclusive).

The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `j`, and `lex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 2, `arr` is `[26, 1, 1]` if `lex` was less than 28, between 28 and 52 (inclusive), or between 2 and 26 (exclusive), or `[26, 26, 1]` if `lex` was between 52 and 78 (inclusive), and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1` if `lex` was less than 28, between 28 and 52 (inclusive), or between 2 and 26 (exclusive), or `lex` is updated to `lex - 26` if `lex` was between 52 and 78 (inclusive). If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[26, 1]` and `lex` remains unchanged.**
