You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word. The function should output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded for each test case, each on a new line.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())
        
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        
        arr.append(lex)
        
        arr.sort()
        
        info.append(arr)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have completed, `cases` will be an integer between 1 and 100, `i` will be equal to `cases - 1`, `info` will be a list containing `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr`. Each `arr` will contain three elements, where the first two elements are either 1 or 26 (depending on the value of `lex` during the iteration), and the third element is the remaining value of `lex` after the operations inside the loop. The exact values of the elements in each `arr` depend on the input values of `lex` provided during each iteration.
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have completed, `cases` remains an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is equal to `cases - 1`, `info` is a list containing `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions as described, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[cases-1][0] + 96`, `info[cases-1][1] + 96`, and `info[cases-1][2] + 96`, `j` is 2, and `range` is 3.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads from stdin a series of test cases. The first line contains an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains an integer `n`. For each `n`, the function outputs the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded, each on a new line.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
