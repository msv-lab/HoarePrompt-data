Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 1, `lex` is `lex - 26`, and `arr` is `[1, 26]` if the original `lex` was less than 28, `[26, 26]` if the original `lex` was between 28 and 51 (inclusive), or `[26]` if the original `lex` was 52 or greater.**

Explanation:
- The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`.
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `j`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for `arr` is based on the original value of `lex` before the subtraction.
