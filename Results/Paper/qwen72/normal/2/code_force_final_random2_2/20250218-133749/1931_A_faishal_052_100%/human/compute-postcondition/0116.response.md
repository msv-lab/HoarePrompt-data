The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the constant `2`, so we can only adjust `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `2`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. However, since the loop condition checks if `j` is less than `2`, the loop will not execute again once `j` is 2.

State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements, `j` is 2**
