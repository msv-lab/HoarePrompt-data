Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 1, and `lex` is updated as follows: If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, `lex` is reduced by 26. The array `arr` is updated as follows: If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is `[1, 26]`; if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26]`; if `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` is `[26, 26]` if `lex` is between 26 and 52 (inclusive) or `[26]` if `lex` is greater than 52. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` remains unchanged and `lex` is not modified.***
