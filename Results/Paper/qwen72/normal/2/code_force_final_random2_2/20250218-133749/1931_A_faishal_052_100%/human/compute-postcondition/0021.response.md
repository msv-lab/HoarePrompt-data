Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is [1, 1] and `lex` is reduced by 1, making `lex` less than 27. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is [26, 1] and `lex` is reduced by 26, making `lex` greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` is [26, 1] if `lex` is between 26 and 52 (inclusive) or [1] if `lex` is greater than 52.**
