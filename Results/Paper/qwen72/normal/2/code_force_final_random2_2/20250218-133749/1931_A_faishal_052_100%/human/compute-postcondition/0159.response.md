Output State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list that will eventually contain `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions as described, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[2][0] + 96`, `info[2][1] + 96`, and `info[2][2] + 96`, `j` is 3, `range` is 3.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `cases` remains an integer greater than 2.
- The variable `i` remains 2.
- The variable `info` is still a list that will eventually contain `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions.
- The variable `temp` now contains a string with three characters, where each character corresponds to the ASCII value of the respective element in `info[2]` plus 96.
- The variable `j` is now 3, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `range` remains 3.
