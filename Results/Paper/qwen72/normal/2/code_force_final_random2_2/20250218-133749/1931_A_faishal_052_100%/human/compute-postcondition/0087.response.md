The code appends the array `arr` to the list `info`. The initial state specifies that `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`. After appending `arr` again, `info` will contain two elements, both being the array `arr`.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing two elements both of which are the array `arr`, `j` is 2, and `arr` is sorted as follows: if `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex - 2]`; if `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`; if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`; if `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`.**
