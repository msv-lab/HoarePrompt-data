The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `cases` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `cases` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 1, `arr` is sorted as `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, 26, lex]`, `[26, 1, lex]`, `[26, 26, lex]` (or any permutation of the last two elements).**
