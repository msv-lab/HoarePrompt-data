Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements, `j` is 2, `arr` is updated based on the value of `lex` after the loop completes, and `lex` is appended to `arr`. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]` and `lex` is reduced by 2. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex]` and `lex` is reduced by 52. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 inclusive, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex]` and `lex` is reduced by 52. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[lex]` and `lex` remains unchanged.**
