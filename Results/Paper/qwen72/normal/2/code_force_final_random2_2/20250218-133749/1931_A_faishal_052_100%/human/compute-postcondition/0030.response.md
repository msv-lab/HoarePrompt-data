Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, and `j` is 1. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is [1], and `lex` is reduced by 1, making `lex` less than 27. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is [26], and `lex` is reduced by 26, making `lex` greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26. If `lex` is 52, `arr` is [26], and `lex` is reduced by 26, making `lex` 26. If `lex` is greater than 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is [26], and `lex` is reduced by 26, making `lex` greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` remains an empty list, and `lex` is not modified.***
