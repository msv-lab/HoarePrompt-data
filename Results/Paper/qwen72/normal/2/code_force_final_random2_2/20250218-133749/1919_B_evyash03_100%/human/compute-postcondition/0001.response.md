The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the object `expression`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression`. If the `expression` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute. The state of `count` being 0 does not affect the loop's ability to execute, so it does not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `expression` must be a string with at least one character (since its length is a positive integer and equals the length of `expression`). Therefore, `char` should be the first character of `expression`.

State: **`expression` is a string consisting only of '+' and '-' characters with a length of at least 1, `char` is the first character of `expression`, `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000, and `length` equals the length of `expression`, `count` is 0**
