### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem as specified. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The goal is to split the array `a` into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The optimal solution involves finding the best way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `expression`.
   - It then returns the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.
   - This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

3. **Examples from the Original Assessment**:
   - For the test case `6\n+-+-+-`, the optimal split is `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`, resulting in a total penalty of 0. The provided program returns 0, which is coincidentally correct but not due to the correct logic.
   - For the test case `10\n--+++++++`, the optimal split is `([-1,-1],[1,1,1,1,1,-1])`, resulting in a total penalty of 8. The provided program returns 6, which is incorrect.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, the program should dynamically determine the best way to split the array to minimize the penalty. This typically involves a dynamic programming approach or a greedy strategy to ensure that the sum of penalties is minimized.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
