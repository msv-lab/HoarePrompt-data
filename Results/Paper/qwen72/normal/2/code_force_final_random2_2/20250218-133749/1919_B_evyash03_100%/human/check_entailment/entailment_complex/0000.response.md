Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into non-empty subarrays and computing the penalty as described. However, the provided solution simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and returns the absolute difference between these counts. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty, which involves more complex logic than just counting characters.

The correct approach should involve finding a way to split the array such that the sum of penalties of the subarrays is minimized. For example, in the case of a string like `"+-+-+"`, the optimal split would be `([1,-1],[1,-1],[1])` or similar, which results in a penalty of 0 because each subarray's sum is 0 or close to 0, minimizing the overall penalty.

The provided function `func_1` does not implement this logic and instead returns a simple difference, which is not the correct way to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
