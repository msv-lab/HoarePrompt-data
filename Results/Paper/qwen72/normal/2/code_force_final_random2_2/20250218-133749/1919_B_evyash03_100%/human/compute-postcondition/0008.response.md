The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `expression`. The loop iterates over each character in the `expression` string. At the end of the last iteration, `char` was the second character of `expression`, and `length` equals the length of `expression`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `expression` (the third character) needs to be considered as the new value of `char`. Since `expression` is a string of at least length 2, and the loop has already processed the first two characters, the string must have at least 3 characters for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`expression` is a string consisting only of '+' and '-' characters with a length of at least 3, `char` is the third character of `expression`, `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000, and `length` equals the length of `expression`. If `char` is '+', `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` remains 1.**
