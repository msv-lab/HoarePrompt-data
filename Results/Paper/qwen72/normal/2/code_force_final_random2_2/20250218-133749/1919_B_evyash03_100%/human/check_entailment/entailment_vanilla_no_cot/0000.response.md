Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, but it does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty as required by the problem statement. The penalty calculation should take into account the sum of the elements in each subarray and the length of each subarray, which this function does not do. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.
