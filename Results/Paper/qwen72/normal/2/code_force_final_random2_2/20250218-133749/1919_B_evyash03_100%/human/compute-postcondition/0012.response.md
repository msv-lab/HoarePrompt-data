The code snippet `sub = length - count` calculates the difference between the length of the `expression` string and the number of '+' characters in it. Since `count` is the number of '+' characters, `sub` will be the number of '-' characters in the `expression`.

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting only of '+' and '-' characters with a length of `length`, `count` is the number of '+' characters in `expression`, `sub` is the number of '-' characters in `expression`.**
