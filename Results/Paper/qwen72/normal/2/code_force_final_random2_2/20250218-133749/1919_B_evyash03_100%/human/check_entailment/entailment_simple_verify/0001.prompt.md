You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    print(func_1(expression, length))

def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            count += 1
    sub = length - count
    return abs(sub - count)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    print(func_1(expression, length))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string consisting only of '+' and '-' characters, and length is a positive integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000, and length equals the length of expression.
def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            count += 1
        
    #State: `expression` is a string consisting only of '+' and '-' characters with a length of `length`, `count` is the number of '+' characters in `expression`.
    sub = length - count
    return abs(sub - count)
    #The program returns the absolute difference between the number of '-' characters (`sub`) and the number of '+' characters (`count`) in the string `expression`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The problem requires us to minimize the penalty by splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` into subarrays. The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. To achieve the minimum possible penalty, we need to consider how the splits affect the sum of each subarray.

### Analysis of the Given Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the string `expression` and its length `length` as input.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `expression`:
     - If the character is '+', it increments the `count`.
   - It calculates the number of '-' characters as `sub = length - count`.
   - Finally, it returns the absolute difference between `sub` and `count`.

### Correctness Check:
- **Understanding the Penalty Calculation:**
  - The penalty of a subarray is \( | \text{sum of elements} | \times \text{length of subarray} \).
  - To minimize the penalty, we should aim to create subarrays with sums close to zero, as this will minimize the absolute value of the sum.

- **Optimal Splitting Strategy:**
  - The optimal strategy is to split the array such that each subarray has a sum of zero or as close to zero as possible.
  - This can be achieved by pairing '+' and '-' characters whenever possible.

- **Given Program's Logic:**
  - The program calculates the number of '+' and '-' characters.
  - It returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters.
  - This approach works because if the number of '+' and '-' characters is equal, the sum of the entire array is zero, and the penalty is zero.
  - If the number of '+' and '-' characters is not equal, the penalty is minimized by the difference in their counts.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters and returning their absolute difference. This approach aligns with the optimal strategy for minimizing the penalty.
