Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed does not implement the required algorithm to solve the problem as specified. The function `func_1` simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. This approach is fundamentally different from the problem's requirement, which involves splitting the array into subarrays and calculating the penalty based on the sum of these subarrays.

For instance, in the test case:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
The optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is `([-1,-1],[1,1,1,1,1,-1])`, resulting in a total penalty of `2 * 2 + 2 * 2 = 8`. However, the provided program returns `abs(2 - 8) = 6`, which is incorrect.

Similarly, in the test case:
```
6
+-+-+-
```
The optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`, resulting in a total penalty of `0`. The provided program coincidentally returns `0` for this specific case, but it does not follow the correct logic for splitting the array.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem's requirement to split the array optimally to minimize the penalty.

Final: **False**
