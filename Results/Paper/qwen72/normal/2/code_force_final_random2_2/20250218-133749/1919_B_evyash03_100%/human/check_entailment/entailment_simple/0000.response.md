Reasoning:  

The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The goal is to minimize the penalty, which is defined as the sum of the penalties of the subarrays obtained by splitting the original array. The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

However, the function `func_1` simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the entire string, which does not account for the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.

To correctly solve this problem, one should consider how to split the array into subarrays such that the penalty is minimized. A key insight is that the optimal way to split the array is to group consecutive '+' and '-' characters together, as this minimizes the penalty for each subarray. For example, in the case of the string `"+-+-+"`, the optimal split would be `(["+", "-"], ["+", "-"], ["+"])`, resulting in a total penalty of 0.

The current implementation does not take this into account and instead returns a value that does not represent the minimum possible penalty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
