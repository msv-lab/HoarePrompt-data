Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and now sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `ans` is a list containing the final values of `sums` after each iteration of the loop, and `t` iterations remain.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The number of test cases remains unchanged.
- **`n`**: The length of the list `a` remains unchanged.
- **`k`**: The value of `k` remains unchanged.
- **`x`**: The value of `x` remains unchanged.
- **`a`**: The list `a` remains sorted in descending order.
- **`sum1`**: The sum of the elements in the list `a` remains unchanged.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `k + 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `k`.
- **`ans`**: The list `ans` will contain the final values of `sums` after each iteration of the loop. Each value in `ans` represents the updated sum based on the conditions specified in the loop.
- **`t` iterations remain**: The number of remaining test cases remains unchanged.
