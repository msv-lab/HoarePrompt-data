To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input.
   - `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0.
   - `x` is the third integer read from the input.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the input and now sorted in descending order.
   - `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`.
   - `i` is equal to `k + 1`.
   - `ans` is a list containing the final values of `sums` after each iteration of the loop.
   - `t` iterations remain.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t` represents the number of test cases.
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `k` is an integer that influences the index `i`.
   - `x` is another integer input.
   - `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
   - `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
   - `i` is set to `k + 1`.
   - `ans` is a list that collects the results of some operations performed in a loop.

3. **Context of the Loop:**
   - The loop likely iterates over the test cases (`t` times).
   - In each iteration, some operations are performed, and the result is appended to the list `ans`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value from the list `ans`.

Given the initial state and the context, the `ans` list contains the results of the operations performed in the loop for each test case. The `max(ans)` function will find the maximum value among these results.

Therefore, the output will be the maximum value from the list `ans`.

Output: **max(ans) (where ans is a list containing the final values of sums after each iteration of the loop)**
