Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` is already given as `i + 1`, which means it has already been incremented before this code snippet is executed.
