Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and now sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `ans` is a list containing the final values of `sums` after each iteration of the loop, and `t` iterations have been completed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variables `n`, `k`, and `x` retain their values as read from the input.
- The list `a` is still sorted in descending order.
- The variable `sum1` holds the sum of the elements in the list `a`.
- The variable `i` is equal to `k + 1`.
- The list `ans` contains the final values of `sums` computed during each iteration of the inner loop.
- All `t` test cases have been processed, and no further iterations remain.
