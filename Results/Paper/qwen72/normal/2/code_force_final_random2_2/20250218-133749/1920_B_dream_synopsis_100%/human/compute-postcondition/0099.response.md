The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sums + a[i - 1]` before this operation, but since the exact value of `sums` and `a[i - 1]` are not specified, we can only say that `sums` has been updated to include the value of `a[i - 1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and now sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `i` is not 0, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sums`, `t` iterations remain, `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.
