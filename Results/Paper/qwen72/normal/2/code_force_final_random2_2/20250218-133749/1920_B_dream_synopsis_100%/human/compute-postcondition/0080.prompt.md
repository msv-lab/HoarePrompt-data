Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the reversed `a`, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `ans` is an empty list, and `t - 1` iterations remain.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the reversed `a`, `i` is 0 or not 0, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sums`, and `t - 1` iterations remain. If `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i` is not 0 and `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the reversed `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing two elements, `t - 1` iterations remain. If `i` is 0, `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and both elements in `ans` are `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, and the second element in `ans` is the updated value of `sums`. If `i` is not 0 and `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`, and the second element in `ans` is the updated value of `sums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is incremented by 1, `k + 1` remains unchanged. If `i == 0`, `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `ans` now includes the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` at its end. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, and `ans` is updated to include the new value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`, and `ans` is updated to include the new value of `sums`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
