To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `k` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `a` is a reversed list of integers.
   - `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
   - `i` is equal to `k + 1`.
   - `ans` is a list containing the values of `sums` after each iteration of the loop. The length of `ans` is `k + 1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` is a reversed list of integers, meaning if the original list was `[1, 2, 3]`, then `a` would be `[3, 2, 1]`.
   - `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
   - `i` is set to `k + 1`, indicating the number of iterations plus one.
   - `ans` is a list that stores the values of `sums` after each iteration of the loop. The length of `ans` is `k + 1`, meaning it contains `k + 1` elements.

3. **Loop and `ans` List:**
   - The loop iterates `k + 1` times, and during each iteration, a value is appended to the list `ans`.
   - The exact nature of the values in `ans` is not specified, but it is clear that `ans` contains `k + 1` elements, each representing a value of `sums` after each iteration.

4. **`max(ans)` Calculation:**
   - The `max(ans)` function will return the maximum value from the list `ans`.
   - Since `ans` contains `k + 1` elements, the `max(ans)` will find the largest value among these elements.

Given this information, the `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value from the list `ans`.

Output: **max(ans) (where ans is a list of k + 1 elements, each representing a value of sums after each iteration of the loop)**
