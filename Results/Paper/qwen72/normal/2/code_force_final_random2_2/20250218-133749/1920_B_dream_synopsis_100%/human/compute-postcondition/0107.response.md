Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and now sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `t` iterations remain, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `sums` is updated by adding the element at index `i - 1` of the list `a` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged.
