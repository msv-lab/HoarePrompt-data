To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is just a placeholder used to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user, representing the number of test cases.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The placeholder `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is not a state that affects the loop's execution.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
