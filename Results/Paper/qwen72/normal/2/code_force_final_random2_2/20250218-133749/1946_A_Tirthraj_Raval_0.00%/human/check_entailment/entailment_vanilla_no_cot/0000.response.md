Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in how the solution calculates the result (`res`). The current implementation counts the occurrences of the current median value in the array, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
1. Identify the current median of the array.
2. Determine the smallest number greater than the current median.
3. Calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the current median equal to this next higher number.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        current_median = a[p]
        next_higher = float('inf')
        
        # Find the smallest number greater than the current median
        for num in a:
            if num > current_median:
                next_higher = min(next_higher, num)
        
        if next_higher == float('inf'):
            # If there is no number greater than the current median, no operations are needed
            print(0)
        else:
            # Calculate the number of operations needed to increase the median
            operations = 0
            for i in range(p, n):
                if a[i] < next_higher:
                    operations += next_higher - a[i]
            print(operations)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly identifies the next higher number and calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median to this next higher number.
