The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts the following parameters:

- An integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of the array `a`.
- An array `a` consisting of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Given these parameters, the function processes each test case and returns some result based on the array `a` for each test case. However, the specific output or return value is not clearly defined in the provided information. 

To provide a more accurate description, let's assume the function returns a list of results, one for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
