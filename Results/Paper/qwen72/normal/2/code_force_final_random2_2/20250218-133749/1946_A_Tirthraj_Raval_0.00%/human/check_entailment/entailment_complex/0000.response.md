Reasoning:

The program's goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. However, the current implementation of the program does not achieve this goal. Instead, it calculates the count of the median element in the sorted array and prints this count. This is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the array to find the current median.
2. Identify the smallest number greater than the current median that can be reached by incrementing elements.
3. Calculate the minimum number of operations needed to make the median equal to this next higher number.

The current program does not perform these steps. It simply counts the occurrences of the current median, which is irrelevant to the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
