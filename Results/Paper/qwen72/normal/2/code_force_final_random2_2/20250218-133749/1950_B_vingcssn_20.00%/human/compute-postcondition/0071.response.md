The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string `'##..##'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state (`c`, `casos`, `n`). Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will always be the same, regardless of the values of these variables.

Output: **##..##**
