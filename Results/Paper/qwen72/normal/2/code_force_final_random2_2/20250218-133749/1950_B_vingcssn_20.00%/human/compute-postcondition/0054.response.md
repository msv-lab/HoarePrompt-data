The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string `'##..##..'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `c`, `casos`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Output: **##..##..**
