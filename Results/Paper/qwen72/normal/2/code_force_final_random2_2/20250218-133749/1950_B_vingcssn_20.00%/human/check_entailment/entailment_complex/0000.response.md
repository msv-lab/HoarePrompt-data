Reasoning:

The provided function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints a checkerboard pattern based on the value of `n`. The function handles four specific cases for `n` (1, 2, 3, and 4) and prints the corresponding checkerboard patterns. However, the function fails to handle cases where `n` is greater than 4, which is within the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) as specified in the problem description. Instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern for these cases, it prints "No esta en el rango".

This behavior is incorrect because the function should generate a checkerboard pattern for any valid `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). The function's logic is incomplete and does not cover the full range of possible inputs.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
