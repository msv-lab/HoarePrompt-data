Precondition: **The function does not take any parameters but expects input from stdin where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) indicating the size of the checkerboard to be generated.**
