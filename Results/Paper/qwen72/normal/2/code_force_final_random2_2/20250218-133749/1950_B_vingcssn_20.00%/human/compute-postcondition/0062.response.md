Postcondition: ***`c` is 1, `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1. If `n` is 2, the value of `n` remains 2. If `n` is 3, the value of `n` remains 3. If `n` is 4, the value of `n` remains 4. For all other values of `n` (including any value not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4), the value of `n` remains unchanged.***
