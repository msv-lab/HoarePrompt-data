The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string:

```python
print('..##..')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state (`c`, `casos`, `n`). The `print` statement simply prints the literal string `'..##..'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **..##..**
