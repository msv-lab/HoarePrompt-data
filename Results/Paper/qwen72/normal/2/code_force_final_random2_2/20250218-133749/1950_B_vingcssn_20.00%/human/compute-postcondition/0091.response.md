The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it expects input from standard input (stdin). The first line of input should contain an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 20), which represents the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines should contain a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), indicating the size of the checkerboard to be generated.

The function processes this input and generates the specified checkerboards. However, the exact nature of the output (e.g., how the checkerboards are represented or displayed) is not specified in the given information.

Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) indicating the size of a checkerboard to be generated. The function processes this input to generate the specified checkerboards.**
