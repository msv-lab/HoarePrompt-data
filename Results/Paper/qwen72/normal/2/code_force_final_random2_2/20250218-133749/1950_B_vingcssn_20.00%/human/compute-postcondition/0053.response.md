Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is 1.
- `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
- `n` is an input integer with specific conditions:
  - If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1.
  - If `n` is 2, the value of `n` remains 2.
  - If `n` is 3, the value of `n` remains 3.
  - If `n` is 4, the value of `n` remains 4.
  - Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4.

The print statement is:
```python
print('..##..##')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints a fixed string.

Output: **..##..##**
