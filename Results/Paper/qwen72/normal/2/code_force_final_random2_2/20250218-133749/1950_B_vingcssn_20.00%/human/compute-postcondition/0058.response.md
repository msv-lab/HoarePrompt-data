Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `c` is 1.
- `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
- `n` is an input integer with specific conditions:
  - If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1.
  - If `n` is 2, the value of `n` remains 2.
  - If `n` is 3, the value of `n` remains 3.
  - If `n` is 4, the value of `n` remains 4.
  - Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No esta en el rango')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'No esta en el rango'`.
- The initial state provides conditions for the value of `n`. If `n` is not 1, 2, 3, or 4, then the `print` statement will execute.
- Since the `print` statement is unconditional and does not depend on any other variables or conditions, it will always print the same string regardless of the value of `n`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'No esta en el rango'`.

Output: **No esta en el rango**
