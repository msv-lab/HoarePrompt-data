Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program is limited to handling only the cases where `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. For any other valid value of `n` within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), the program prints "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. This behavior is indeed incorrect according to the problem description, which requires the program to handle any value of `n` within the specified range and produce the appropriate checkerboard pattern.

The annotations confirm that the program's logic is based on explicit conditions for `n` being 1, 2, 3, or 4, and it fails to generate the correct output for any other valid input. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
