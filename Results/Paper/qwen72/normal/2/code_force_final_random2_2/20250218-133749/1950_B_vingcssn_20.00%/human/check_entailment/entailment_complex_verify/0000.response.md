Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a significant flaw in the program. The program is designed to handle only specific cases (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) and fails to generate the correct checkerboard pattern for other valid values of `n` within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). Specifically, for any `n` outside the hardcoded cases, the program outputs "No esta en el rango" instead of the required checkerboard pattern. This behavior directly contradicts the problem description, which mandates that the program should correctly generate the checkerboard for any valid `n`. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
