The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `m`. The value of `m` is between 1 and 5, so `ans` is now equal to `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user, 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer provided by the user, 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is the second integer provided by the user, 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `ans` is equal to `m`, `i` is 'A' (the first character in `p`). The character 'A' is not present in the string `s`.**
