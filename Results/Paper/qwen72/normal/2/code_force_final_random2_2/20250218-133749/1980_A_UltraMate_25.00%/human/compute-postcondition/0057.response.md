Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer provided by the user, 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer provided by the user, 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is the second integer provided by the user, 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s` and must have at least two keys, `i` is the next key in the iteration order of `hmp` after the current `i`. If the frequency of this new key in `hmp` is less than `m`, then `ans` is incremented by `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
