Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= n <= 50), `m` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a new non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `i` is 'F'. `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in the string `s`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be the last character in the string `p`, which is 'F'. The variable `ans` will be the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in the string `s`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `p`, and `hmp`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
