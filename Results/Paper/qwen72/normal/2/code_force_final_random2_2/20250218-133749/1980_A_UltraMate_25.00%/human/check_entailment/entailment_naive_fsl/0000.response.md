Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the difficulty level 'G' is required. The string `p` used in the program only includes 'ABCDEF', which means the program will not check for the presence or count of 'G' problems. This leads to incorrect results when 'G' problems are needed to complete the rounds.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
10 1
BGECDCBDED
```
The correct output should be 2 (one 'A' and one 'G'), but the program will output 1 because it does not account for 'G'.
