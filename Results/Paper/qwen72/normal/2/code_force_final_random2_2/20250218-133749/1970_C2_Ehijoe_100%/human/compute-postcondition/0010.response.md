The code `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the integer `v` to the list stored at the key `u` in the `nodes` dictionary. Given that `nodes[u]` already contains the list `[v]`, appending `v` again results in `nodes[u]` containing the list `[v, v]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an input integer, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` contains the list [v, v], `nodes[v]` contains the list [u]**.
