Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an input integer, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list and must have at least one key-value pair, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `nodes[u]` contains a list of all connected nodes for each `u`, `nodes[v]` contains a list of all connected nodes for each `v`, `leaves` is a deque containing all keys from `nodes` where the list of connected nodes for each key has exactly one element, `start` is an input integer, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the result of the function `func_1(nodes, start)` to the variable `moves`. The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `nodes` and `start`. The exact value of `moves` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, but it is now stored in the variable `moves`. All other variables remain unchanged.
