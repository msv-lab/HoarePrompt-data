Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an input integer, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` contains the list [v, v, v], `nodes[v]` contains the list [u, u, u], `n` must be greater than 3, `u` and `v` are updated to new input integers.**

Explanation:
- The code `nodes[v].append(u)` appends the integer `u` to the list stored in `nodes[v]`.
- Before the code execution, `nodes[v]` contained the list `[u, u]`.
- After the code execution, `nodes[v]` now contains the list `[u, u, u]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
