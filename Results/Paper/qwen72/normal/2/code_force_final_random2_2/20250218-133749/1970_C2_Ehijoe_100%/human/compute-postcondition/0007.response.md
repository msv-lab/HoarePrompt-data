The code snippet `nodes[v].append(u)` adds the element `u` to the list stored at the key `v` in the `nodes` dictionary. Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory set to list.
- `nodes[u]` already contains the list `[v]`.
- After executing `nodes[v].append(u)`, the list at `nodes[v]` will contain `u`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an input integer, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 0, `nodes[u]` contains the list [v], `nodes[v]` contains the list [u].**
