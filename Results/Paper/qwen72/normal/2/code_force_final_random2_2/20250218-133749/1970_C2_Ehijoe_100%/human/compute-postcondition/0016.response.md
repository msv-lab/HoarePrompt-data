Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an input integer, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `nodes[u]` contains a list of all connected nodes for each `u`, `nodes[v]` contains a list of all connected nodes for each `v`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `n-1` times, so after all iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-2`.
- For each iteration, the loop reads two integers `u` and `v` from the input and appends `v` to the list of `nodes[u]` and `u` to the list of `nodes[v]`.
- After all iterations, `nodes` will contain a list of all connected nodes for each key (node) in the graph.
- The variables `n`, `t`, `start`, `edges`, and `empty` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
