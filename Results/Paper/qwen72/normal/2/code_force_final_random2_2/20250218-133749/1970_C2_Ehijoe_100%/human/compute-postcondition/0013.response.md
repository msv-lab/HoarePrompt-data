Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an input integer, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` contains the list [v, v], `nodes[v]` contains the list [u, u], `n` must be greater than 3, `u` and `v` are updated to new input integers.**

Explanation:
- The line `u, v = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `u` and `v`.
- All other variables (`n`, `t`, `nodes`, `start`, `edges`, `empty`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The new values of `u` and `v` are the integers read from the input, replacing their previous values.
- The conditions and constraints on the variables (`n` within the specified range, `start` within the specified range, `n` must be greater than 3) remain valid.
