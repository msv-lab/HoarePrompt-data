Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. If `s` consists of the same character repeated more than once, then `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s2` is a shuffled version of `s`. If `s` equals `s2`, then `s2` is the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end of the string. Otherwise, `s2` remains a shuffled version of `s`.***
