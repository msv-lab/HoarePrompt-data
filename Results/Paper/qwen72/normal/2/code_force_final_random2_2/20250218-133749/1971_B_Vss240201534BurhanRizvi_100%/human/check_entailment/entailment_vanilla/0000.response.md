### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Single Character String**: If the length of the string `s` is 1, the program prints 'No' because it is impossible to rearrange a single character string to form a different string. This is correct.

3. **All Characters Are the Same**: If the string `s` consists of the same character repeated (i.e., `len(set(s)) == 1`), the program prints 'No' because it is impossible to rearrange such a string to form a different string. This is also correct.

4. **Random Rearrangement**: For other cases, the program attempts to rearrange the string using `random.sample(s, len(s))`. This is a valid approach to generate a random permutation of the string.

5. **Check for Equality**: After generating a random permutation `s2`, the program checks if `s2` is equal to the original string `s`. If they are equal, it modifies `s2` by moving the first character to the end (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`). This ensures that `s2` is different from `s`.

6. **Output**: The program prints 'Yes' followed by the rearranged string `s2`.

### Analysis:
- The logic for handling single-character strings and strings with all characters the same is correct.
- The use of `random.sample` to generate a random permutation is a valid approach.
- The check to ensure `s2` is different from `s` is necessary and correctly implemented.

However, there is a minor issue with the case sensitivity of the output. The problem statement specifies that "YES" and "NO" can be in any case, but the program consistently outputs 'No' and 'Yes'. This is not a correctness issue but a minor formatting issue.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
