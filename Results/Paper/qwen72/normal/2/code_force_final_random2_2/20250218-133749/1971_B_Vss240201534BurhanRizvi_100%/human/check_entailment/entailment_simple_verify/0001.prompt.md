You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. For each iteration, if the length of `s` is 1 or if all characters in `s` are the same, the program outputs 'No'. Otherwise, it outputs 'Yes' followed by a shuffled version of `s` (or a shifted version if the shuffled version matches the original `s`). The loop runs `t` times, and for each input string `s`, the conditions and outputs described above are applied.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Single Character String**: If the length of the string `s` is 1, the program prints 'No' because it is impossible to rearrange a single character string to form a different string. This is correct.

3. **All Characters Are the Same**: If the string `s` consists of the same character repeated (i.e., `len(set(s)) == 1`), the program prints 'No' because it is impossible to rearrange such a string to form a different string. This is also correct.

4. **Random Rearrangement**: For other cases, the program attempts to rearrange the string using `random.sample(s, len(s))`. This is a valid approach to generate a random permutation of the string.

5. **Check for Equality**: After generating a random permutation `s2`, the program checks if `s2` is equal to the original string `s`. If they are equal, it modifies `s2` by moving the first character to the end (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`). This ensures that `s2` is different from `s`.

6. **Output**: The program prints 'Yes' followed by the rearranged string `s2`.

### Analysis:
- The logic for handling single-character strings and strings with all characters the same is correct.
- The use of `random.sample` to generate a random permutation is a valid approach.
- The check to ensure `s2` is different from `s` is necessary and correctly implemented.

However, there is a minor issue with the case sensitivity of the output. The problem statement specifies that "YES" and "NO" can be in any case, but the program consistently outputs 'No' and 'Yes'. This is not a correctness issue but a minor formatting issue.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
