Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `s` is an input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
- The length of `s` is greater than 1.
- The set of characters in `s` is not all the same, or the length of `s` is 1.
- `s2` is a shuffled version of `s`.
  - If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is now the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end of the string.
  - Otherwise, `s2` remains a shuffled version of `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Validation**:
   - `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `s` is a string with specific constraints: it must be at least 2 characters long, and if it is longer than 1 character, it must contain at least two different characters.

2. **Shuffling and Condition**:
   - `s2` is initially a shuffled version of `s`.
   - If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is modified by moving the first character of `s` to the end of the string.
   - This ensures that `s2` is always different from `s` if `s` is longer than 1 character and contains at least two different characters.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The code snippet simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions and the code snippet, the print statement will always execute and print `'Yes'` regardless of the specific values of `t` and `s` as long as they meet the initial state constraints.

Output: **Yes**
