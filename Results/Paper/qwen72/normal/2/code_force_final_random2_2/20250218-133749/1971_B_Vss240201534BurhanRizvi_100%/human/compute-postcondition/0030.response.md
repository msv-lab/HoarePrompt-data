The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state describes two variables, `t` and `s`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the values of `t` and `s` do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **No**
