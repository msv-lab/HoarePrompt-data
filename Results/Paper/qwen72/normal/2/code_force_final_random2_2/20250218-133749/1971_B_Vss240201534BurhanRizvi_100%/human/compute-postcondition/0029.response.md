The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t` and `s`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.

However, the `print` statement does not reference either `t` or `s`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
