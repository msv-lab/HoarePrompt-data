You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of up to 10 lowercase English letters. If the string `s` has a length of 1 or all characters in `s` are the same, the function prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by a shuffled version of `s`. If the shuffled version matches the original string, it prints a shifted version of `s` (the last character moved to the front). The function processes `t` test cases and prints the results for each.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical issue in how it handles the output for certain cases. Specifically, the program uses `print('No')` instead of `print('NO')` when the string cannot be rearranged. According to the problem description, the output should be "NO" (in uppercase), but the program outputs "No" (with a lowercase 'n'). This discrepancy means the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Additionally, the program uses `random.sample` to shuffle the string, which might not always produce a different string from the original, especially for strings with many repeated characters. The fallback mechanism `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` ensures that the string is different, but this is not a robust solution and may not always produce a valid result, especially for strings with specific patterns.

To fix these issues, the program should ensure that the output is always "NO" in uppercase and should have a more reliable method to generate a different string.
