The value of `bc` is incremented by 1. Initially, if `i` is 'A', then `bc` was 0, and now it becomes 1. If `i` is not 'A', then `bc` was 1, and now it becomes 2. The values of `t`, `q`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `ac` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, `q` is 0, `s` is a string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `s`. If `i` is 'A', then `ac` is 2 and `bc` is 1. Otherwise, `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 2.**
