The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 32). For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length 5 containing only 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in `s`. If the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.
