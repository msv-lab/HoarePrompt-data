Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of the string `a`), `m` (an integer representing the minimum number of times each character should appear in `a`), and `a` (a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'). It calculates and returns the number of additional problems needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string `a`. If a character appears fewer than `m` times, the function increments the count of additional problems by the difference between `m` and the number of occurrences of that character. **
