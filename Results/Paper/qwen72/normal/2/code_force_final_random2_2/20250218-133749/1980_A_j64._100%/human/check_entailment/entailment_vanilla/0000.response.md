Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by the string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Problems**: The function `func_1` initializes a list `count` of size 7 (to represent the counts of problems with difficulties 'A' to 'G'). It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `count` based on the character's position in the alphabet.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems**: The program then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level. If the count of a particular difficulty level is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when there are no problems of a certain difficulty level or when the number of problems is exactly enough for the required rounds.

6. **Correctness Check**: The logic implemented in the program matches the problem description and the example provided. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed to hold `m` rounds.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
