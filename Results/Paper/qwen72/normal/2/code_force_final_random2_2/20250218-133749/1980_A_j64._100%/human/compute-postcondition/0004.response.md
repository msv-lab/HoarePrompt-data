The value at the index `ord(char) - ord('A')` in the list `count` is incremented by 1. The initial value at this index was 1, so it becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list where the element at index `ord(char) - ord('A')` is 2 and all other elements are 0, `char` is the second character in the string `a`.**
