Output State: **After all iterations, `t` is the same as the initial value, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is the last input integer, `s` is the last input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the last `s`, and `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the last `s`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The total number of test cases `t` remains unchanged from the initial state.
- The loop index `i` will be one less than the total number of test cases (`t - 1`), indicating that the loop has run through all test cases.
- The variable `n` will hold the value of the last input integer, which represents the length of the last string `s`.
- The variable `s` will be the last input string with all occurrences of the substring 'map' removed.
- The variable `m` will hold the count of how many times the substring 'map' appeared in the last input string `s` before it was removed.
- The variable `p` will hold the count of how many times the substring 'pie' appears in the last modified string `s`.
