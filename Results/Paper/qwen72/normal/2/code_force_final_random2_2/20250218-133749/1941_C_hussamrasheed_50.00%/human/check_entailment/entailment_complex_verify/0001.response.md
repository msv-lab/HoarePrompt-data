### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of deletions required to make a string "beautiful".
   - A string is "ugly" if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - We need to remove the minimum number of characters to ensure the string does not contain these substrings.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the occurrences of the substring "map" in the string `s` and stores it in `m`.
   - It replaces all occurrences of "map" with an empty string.
   - It counts the occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` and stores it in `p`.
   - It prints the sum of `m` and `p`.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The solution only counts and removes occurrences of "map" and "pie" independently.
   - This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the overlap between "map" and "pie". For example, in the string "mapie", removing "map" would leave "ie", which still contains "pie".
   - Additionally, the solution does not handle cases where "pie" and "map" overlap in more complex ways, such as "mapie" or "pmap".

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a more sophisticated method to identify and remove overlapping occurrences of "pie" and "map".
   - One possible approach is to use a sliding window or a state machine to track the presence of "pie" and "map" and count the minimum deletions required to remove them.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution is incorrect because it does not handle overlapping substrings and may not always produce the minimum number of deletions required.
