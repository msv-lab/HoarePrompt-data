The code snippet `p = s.count('pie')` updates the value of `p` to the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is 0, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the updated `s`.**
