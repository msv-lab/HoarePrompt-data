You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        m = s.count('map')
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        p = s.count('pie')
        print(m + p)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. The function counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' in `s`, removes all occurrences of 'map' from `s`, and then counts the occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the modified string. It prints the sum of these two counts for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the state of the program includes the original number of test cases `t`, the last processed integer `n`, the last processed string `s` with all 'map' substrings removed, the count of 'map' in the last `s`, and the count of 'pie' in the last modified `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only counts and removes occurrences of the exact substrings "map" and "pie" but does not account for overlapping occurrences or partial matches that could still form "map" or "pie" after some characters are removed.

For example, consider the string "mappie":
- The program will count one occurrence of "map" and one occurrence of "pie".
- It will then replace "map" with an empty string, resulting in "pie".
- Finally, it will count and remove "pie".

However, the correct approach should recognize that "mappie" contains overlapping substrings "map" and "pie" and should remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate both. In this case, removing the 'a' and 'p' would make the string "mpie", which is still ugly. The correct solution would be to remove the 'm' and 'p' to get "apie", which is also ugly. The optimal solution is to remove the 'm' and 'p' to get "appie", which is beautiful.

Thus, the program fails to correctly handle overlapping substrings and does not always produce the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
