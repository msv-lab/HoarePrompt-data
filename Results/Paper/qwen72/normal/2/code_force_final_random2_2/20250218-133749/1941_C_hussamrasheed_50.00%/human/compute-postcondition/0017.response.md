Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to the new input string provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The new value of `s` does not affect the values of `m` or `p` since they are based on the original `s` before the update.
