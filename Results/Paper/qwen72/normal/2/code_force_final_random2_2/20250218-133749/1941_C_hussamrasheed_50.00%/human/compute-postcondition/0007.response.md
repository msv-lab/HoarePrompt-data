Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be at least 1 (this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
   - `i` is 0 (this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
   - `n` is an input integer (this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
   - `s` is the input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed.
   - `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`.
   - `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(m + p)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `m` is the count of how many times the substring 'map' appeared in the original string `s`.
   - `p` is the count of how many times the substring 'pie' appears in the modified string `s` (after removing all occurrences of 'map').

4. **What is Printed:**
   - The print statement will output the sum of `m` and `p`.

Since the exact values of `m` and `p` depend on the input string `s`, we cannot determine their exact numerical values without knowing the specific input. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **m + p (where m is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original string s, and p is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string s after removing all occurrences of 'map')**
