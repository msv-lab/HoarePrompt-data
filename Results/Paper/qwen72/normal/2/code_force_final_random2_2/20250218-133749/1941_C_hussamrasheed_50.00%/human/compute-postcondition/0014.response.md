To determine what will be printed by the `print(m + p)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be at least 2 (this value is not directly relevant to the print statement).
   - `i` is 1 (this value is not directly relevant to the print statement).
   - `n` is an input integer (this value is not directly relevant to the print statement).
   - `s` is the new input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed.
   - `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`.
   - `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `s` is derived from an original string where all occurrences of 'map' have been removed.
   - `m` counts how many times 'map' was present in the original string.
   - `p` counts how many times 'pie' appears in the modified string `s` after removing 'map'.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(m + p)` will print the sum of `m` and `p`.

4. **Explanation:**
   - `m` is the count of 'map' in the original string.
   - `p` is the count of 'pie' in the modified string after removing all 'map' occurrences.
   - The sum `m + p` represents the total count of 'map' in the original string plus the count of 'pie' in the modified string.

Given this understanding, the output of the print statement will be the sum of these two counts.

Output: **m + p (where m is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original string and p is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new string after removing all occurrences of 'map')**
