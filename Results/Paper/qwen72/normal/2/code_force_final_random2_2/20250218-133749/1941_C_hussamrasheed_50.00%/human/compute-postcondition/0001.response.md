The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. Since `t` represents the number of test cases and it is given that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, as it is the starting point of the range.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1 and `i` is 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
