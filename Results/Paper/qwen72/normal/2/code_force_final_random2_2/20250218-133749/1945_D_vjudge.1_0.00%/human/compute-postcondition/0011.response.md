Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 0, `soma_b` is 0, `pref` is the first element of `lista_A`, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers read from the input, and the first element of `lista_A` is less than the first element of `lista_B`.**

The code snippet `soma_b = 0` sets the variable `soma_b` to 0, which was already its initial value. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged. All other variables and conditions remain the same as they were in the initial state.
