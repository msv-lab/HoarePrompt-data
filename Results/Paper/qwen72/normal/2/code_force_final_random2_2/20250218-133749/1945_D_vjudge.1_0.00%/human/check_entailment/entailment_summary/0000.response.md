### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Kirill wants to move forward in a queue to be within the first `m` positions.
   - He can bribe people to move forward, paying different costs depending on the positions he moves through.
   - The goal is to find the minimum cost for Kirill to achieve his desired position.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - Reads `n` and `k` (where `k` is the same as `m` in the problem statement).
     - Reads two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` of length `n`.
     - Reverses both lists.
     - Computes the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions.
     - The logic involves iterating through the reversed lists and calculating the minimum cost using a prefix sum approach.
     - The final result is printed.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - Reads the number of test cases `numero_testes`.
     - Calls `func_1` for each test case.
     - Ensures that the function `func_1` is called the correct number of times.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Input Handling**: Both functions handle input correctly, reading the necessary values and lists.
   - **Reversal of Lists**: Reversing the lists is a key part of the algorithm, as it allows the function to process the queue from the back to the front, which is necessary for the prefix sum calculation.
   - **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation in `func_1` is designed to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions. The logic involves comparing the costs of moving to different positions and updating the minimum cost accordingly.
   - **Output**: The final result is printed correctly for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
