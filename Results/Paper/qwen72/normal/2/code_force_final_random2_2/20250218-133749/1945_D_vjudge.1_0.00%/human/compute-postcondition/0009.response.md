Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer `numero_testes` from user input, ensuring it is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. It then calls the function `func_1` exactly `numero_testes` times. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, `numero_testes` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `func_1` has been executed `numero_testes` times. **
