Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 0, `soma_b` is 0, `pref` is the first element of `lista_A`, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers read from the input, and the first element of `lista_A` is less than the first element of `lista_B`.** 

Explanation: The code `pref += lista_A[i]` updates the value of `pref` by adding the first element of `lista_A` to it. Since `i` is 0, `lista_A[i]` refers to the first element of `lista_A`. All other variables remain unchanged.
