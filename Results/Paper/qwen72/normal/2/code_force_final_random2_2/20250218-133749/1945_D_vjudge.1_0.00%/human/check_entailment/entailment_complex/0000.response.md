Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function reads `n` and `k` from the input, followed by two lists of integers `lista_A` and `lista_B` of length `n`.
   - It reverses both lists to facilitate the processing from the end of the queue to the front.
   - The function then iterates through the first `n - k` elements of the reversed lists to calculate the initial cost (`soma_b`) and the prefix sum (`pref`).
   - After the initial loop, it calculates the minimum cost (`resultado`) by considering the remaining elements from `n - k` to `n - 1`.
   - The final result is printed, which is the minimum cost required for Kirill to move to one of the first `k` positions.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases (`numero_testes`) from the input.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case, ensuring that the function processes each test case independently.

### Analysis:
- **Input Handling**: Both functions correctly handle the input as specified in the problem statement.
- **Logic**:
  - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `k` positions by considering the costs associated with moving past other people in the queue.
  - The use of `soma_b` and `pref` ensures that the cumulative costs are calculated efficiently.
  - The final loop in `func_1` correctly finds the minimum cost by considering all possible positions from `n - k` to `n - 1`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles edge cases such as when `n` is equal to `k` (i.e., Kirill is already in one of the first `k` positions) and when `n` is much larger than `k`.

- **Output**:
  - The output is correctly formatted and matches the expected output for the given examples.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
