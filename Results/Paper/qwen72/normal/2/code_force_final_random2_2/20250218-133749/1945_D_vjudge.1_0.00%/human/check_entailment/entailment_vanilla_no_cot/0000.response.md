Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. **Reversing Lists**: By reversing the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`, the program simplifies the logic for calculating the minimum cost. This is because it allows the program to start from the end of the queue (where Kirill initially stands) and move towards the front.
3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through the first `n - k` elements to calculate the initial cost (`pref`) and the cumulative cost of bribing (`soma_b`).
   - For each position from `n - k` to `n`, it calculates the minimum cost required to reach a position within the first `k` positions.
4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

The logic and implementation seem to align with the problem requirements, and the program handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
