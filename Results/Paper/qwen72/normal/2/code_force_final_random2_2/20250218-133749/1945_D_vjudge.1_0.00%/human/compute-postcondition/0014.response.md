Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 0, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, and `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers read from the input. If the first element of `lista_A` is less than the first element of `lista_B`, then `pref` is set to the first element of `lista_A` and `soma_b` remains 0. Otherwise, `soma_b` is set to the first element of `lista_B` and `pref` remains 0.***
