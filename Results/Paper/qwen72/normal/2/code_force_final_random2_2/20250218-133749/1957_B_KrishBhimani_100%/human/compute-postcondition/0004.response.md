Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- The current value of `n` is 1.

Given this information, the `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the second element of the list `l1`.

Since the value of `k` is directly derived from the second element of `l1`, and no further operations or transformations are applied to it, the output will be the integer value of the second element of `l1`.

Output: **k (where k is the integer value of the second element of l1)**
