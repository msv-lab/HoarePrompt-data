Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is a list containing the value `(1 << i) - 1`, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i\).**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value `(1 << i) - 1` to the list `ans`.
- The value `(1 << i)` is equivalent to \(2^i\), so `(1 << i) - 1` is \(2^i - 1\).
- The value of `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i\).
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
