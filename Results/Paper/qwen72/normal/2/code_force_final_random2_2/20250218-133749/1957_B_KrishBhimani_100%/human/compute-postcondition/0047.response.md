Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, if `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `k0` is now equal to `k`, `temp` is 2, and the current value of `temp * 2` is 4, which is still less than `k`.** 

The variable `i` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
