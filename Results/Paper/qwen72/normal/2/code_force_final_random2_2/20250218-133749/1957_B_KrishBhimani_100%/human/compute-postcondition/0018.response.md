Since the loop condition is `while True:`, this means the loop will always execute unless there is a break statement inside the loop body. Given that the loop condition does not depend on any specific variable state, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is an empty list. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 0, `temp` is 1, and `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
