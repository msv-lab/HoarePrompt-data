Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is an empty list. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is 4. Otherwise, `i` is 0, `temp` is 2, and `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `temp` was initially 2 and `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is 2 and `temp` is 8. If `temp` was initially 1 and `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is 4. If `temp` was initially 1 and `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `i` is 0 and `temp` is 2.**
