Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the number of non-negative integers to be printed and their sum, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
