The code snippet `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends zeros to the list `ans` until its length equals `n`. Here's the detailed impact:

- `ans` originally contains the values \(2^i - 1\) and \(k - 2^i + 1\).
- The length of `ans` is initially 2.
- The number of zeros appended to `ans` is calculated as `n - len(ans)`, which is `n - 2`.
- After appending, the length of `ans` will be `n`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` and is now equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values \(2^i - 1\), \(k - 2^i + 1\), and `n - 2` zeros, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `arr` is an empty list, `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, and `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before it became greater than or equal to `k`.**
