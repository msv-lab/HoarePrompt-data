Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, if `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is an empty list, `k0` is now equal to `k`. After the loop, `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, and `i` is the number of times the loop executed, which is the exponent of 2 in `temp`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to double `temp` and increment `i` until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`.
- When the loop exits, `temp` will be the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.
- The variable `i` will be the number of times the loop executed, which corresponds to the exponent of 2 in `temp`.

For example, if `k` is 17, the loop will execute 4 times:
- First iteration: `temp` becomes 2, `i` becomes 1.
- Second iteration: `temp` becomes 4, `i` becomes 2.
- Third iteration: `temp` becomes 8, `i` becomes 3.
- Fourth iteration: `temp` becomes 16, `i` becomes 4.
- The loop exits because `temp * 2` (which is 32) is not less than `k` (which is 17).

So, the final state will be:
- `temp` = 16 (the largest power of 2 less than 17)
- `i` = 4 (the number of iterations)

All other variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
