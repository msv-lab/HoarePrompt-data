Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list.** 

The code initializes a new empty list called `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
