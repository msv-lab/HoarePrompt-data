Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 1 or 2 or 3 depending on the initial conditions, `temp` is 4 or 8 or 2 depending on the initial conditions.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
- If `temp` was initially 2 and `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` was initially 2, so now `i` is 3 and `temp` is 8.
- If `temp` was initially 1 and `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` was initially 1, so now `i` is 2 and `temp` is 4.
- If `temp` was initially 1 and `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `i` was initially 0, so now `i` is 1 and `temp` is 2.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
