Postcondition: ***`num` is `min(less) - max(big)` if `i` is within the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)`, inclusive. Otherwise, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. `iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last integers provided by user input, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` is a list containing at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `no`, and `innerLoop` is the input integer.***
