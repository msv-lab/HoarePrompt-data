You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, ensuring a finite solution. No two constraints are the same within a test case.
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        
        big = []
        
        no = []
        
        num = 0
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        
        num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
        
        if num < 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        for i in no:
            if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
                num -= 1
        
        print(num)
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `iterable` will be equal to `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last integers provided by user input, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2, `no` contains all values of `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, and `num` is the final calculated value based on the conditions described in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a number of constraints. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of constraints, and a list of constraints `(a, x)` where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer. The function returns a solution for each test case that satisfies the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
