The code snippet `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Based on the initial state, the value of `x` determines the initial content of `big`, `less`, and `no`. Since the code only modifies `big`, the other variables remain unchanged.

- If `x` is 1, `big` initially contains `[a]`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. After executing the code, `big` will contain `[a, a]`.
- If `x` is 2, `less` initially contains `[a]`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. After executing the code, `big` will contain `[a]`.
- If `x` is anything other than 1 or 2, `less` and `big` are initially empty lists, and `no` contains `[a]`. After executing the code, `big` will contain `[a]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `big` is a list containing the value of `a` (if `x` is 2 or not 1) or `[a, a]` (if `x` is 1), `less` is a list containing the value of `a` (if `x` is 2) or is an empty list (otherwise), and `no` is a list containing the value of `a` (if `x` is not 1 or 2) or is an empty list (if `x` is 1 or 2).**
