The code snippet `big.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `big`. Based on the initial state, we know that `big` could be a list containing `[a]` if `x` was 1, or it could be an empty list otherwise. Regardless of its initial state, after executing the code, `big` will contain `a` as one of its elements.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is 1, `x` and `a` are updated to the new integers provided by user input, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 1, `big` is a list containing `[a]`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list.**
