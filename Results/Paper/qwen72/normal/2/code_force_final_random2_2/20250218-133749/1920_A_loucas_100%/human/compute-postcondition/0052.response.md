To determine what will be printed when the `print(num)` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the logic described:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `no` is a non-empty list.
   - `i` will be the last element of the list `no` after the loop has executed all iterations.
   - `less` and `big` are lists whose minimum and maximum values are used in the condition.
   - `num` is a variable that starts with an initial value and is decremented based on a specific condition.

2. **Condition**:
   - For each element `i` in `no`, if `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1.
   - Otherwise, `num` remains unchanged for those elements.

3. **Final Value of `num`**:
   - The final value of `num` will be the initial value of `num` minus the number of elements in `no` that satisfy the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`.

Given this information, the `print(num)` statement will output the final value of `num` after the loop has processed all elements in `no`.

### Explanation:
- **Initial Value of `num`**: Let's denote the initial value of `num` as `num_initial`.
- **Number of Elements Satisfying the Condition**: Let's denote the number of elements in `no` that satisfy the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)` as `count_satisfying`.

The final value of `num` will be:
\[ \text{num} = \text{num_initial} - \text{count_satisfying} \]

### Output:
Output: **num (where num is the initial value of num minus the number of elements in no that satisfy the condition i <= min(less) and i >= max(big))**
