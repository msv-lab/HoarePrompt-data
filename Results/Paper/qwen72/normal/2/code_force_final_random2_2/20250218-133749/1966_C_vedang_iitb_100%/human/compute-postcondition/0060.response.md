Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input that must have at least three elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `sz` is the third element of `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 3. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 2 if `sz` is not 1, and 1 if `sz` is 1.***
