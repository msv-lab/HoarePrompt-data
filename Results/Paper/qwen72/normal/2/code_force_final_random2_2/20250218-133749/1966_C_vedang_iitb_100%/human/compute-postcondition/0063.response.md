Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 2.
   - `tc` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input.
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - We need to determine whether `mexsize % 2 == 0` (i.e., whether `mexsize` is even).
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - Since `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, it means `mexsize` is the next integer after the largest number in the list `a`.
   - If the list `a` contains all integers from 1 up to `maxsize`, then `mexsize` would be `maxsize + 1`.

4. **Determine the Parity of `mexsize`:**
   - If `maxsize` is even, then `mexsize = maxsize + 1` is odd.
   - If `maxsize` is odd, then `mexsize = maxsize + 1` is even.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `mexsize` is the next integer after `maxsize`, and `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, `mexsize` will be even if `maxsize` is odd, and odd if `maxsize` is even.
   - Therefore, `mexsize % 2 == 0` will be true if `maxsize` is odd, and false if `maxsize` is even.

6. **Final Output:**
   - If `mexsize` is even, the print statement will output 'Alice'.
   - If `mexsize` is odd, the print statement will output 'Bob'.

Given that `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list and is greater than `maxsize`, the parity of `mexsize` depends on the parity of `maxsize`.

Output: **'Alice' if `maxsize` is odd, otherwise 'Bob'**.
