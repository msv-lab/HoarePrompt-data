Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, and `mexsize` is 1.** 

The code sets `mexsize` to 1, overriding its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize` or less than or equal to `maxsize` no longer applies since `mexsize` is now explicitly set to 1.
