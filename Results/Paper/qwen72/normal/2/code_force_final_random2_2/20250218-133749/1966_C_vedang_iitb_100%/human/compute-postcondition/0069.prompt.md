You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of piles, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represents the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        maxsize = max(a)
        
        a.sort()
        
        mexsize = 1
        
        for sz in a:
            if sz == mexsize:
                mexsize = mexsize + 1
        
        if mexsize > maxsize:
            print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `tc` is equal to the initial value of `t` minus 1, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last sorted list of integers provided by the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the last list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the last list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, the program follows the logic for the if part. If `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`, the program follows the logic for the else part.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. It returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
