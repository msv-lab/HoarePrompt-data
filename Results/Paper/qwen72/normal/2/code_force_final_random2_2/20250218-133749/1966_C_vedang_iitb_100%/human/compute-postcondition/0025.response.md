The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 1
- `tc` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`
- `mexsize` is the smallest integer greater than 0 that is not present in the list `a`
- If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, then `mexsize` is greater than the maximum value in the list `a`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

After executing the code snippet, the list `a` is updated to the new list of integers provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the new list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest integer greater than 0 that is not present in the new list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, then `mexsize` is greater than the maximum value in the new list `a`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.**
