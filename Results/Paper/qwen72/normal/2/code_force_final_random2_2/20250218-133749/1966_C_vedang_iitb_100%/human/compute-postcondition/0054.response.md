Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is 1, `sz` is the first element of `a`. If `sz` (the first element of `a`) is equal to 1, then `mexsize` is updated to 2.***
