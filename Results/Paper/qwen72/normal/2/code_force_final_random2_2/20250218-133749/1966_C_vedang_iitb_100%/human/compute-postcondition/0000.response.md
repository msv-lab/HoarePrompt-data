Output State: **t is an integer input by the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of piles, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represents the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
