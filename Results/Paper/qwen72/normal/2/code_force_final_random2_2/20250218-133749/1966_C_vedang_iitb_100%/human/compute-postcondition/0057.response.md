Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input that must have at least two elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `sz` is the second element of `a`. If `sz` (the second element of `a`) is equal to 1, then `mexsize` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.***
