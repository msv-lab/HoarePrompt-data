Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the sorted list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, then `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.**
