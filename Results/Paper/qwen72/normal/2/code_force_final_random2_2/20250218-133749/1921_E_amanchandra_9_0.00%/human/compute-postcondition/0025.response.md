To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions in the `print` statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers from the input.
- `i` is 1.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `x` is equal to the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2.
- `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`.
- `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `x`:**
   - `x = abs(xa - xb) / 2`

2. **Calculate `l`:**
   - `l = max(1, ya - x)`

3. **Calculate `r`:**
   - `r = min(w, yb + x)`

4. **Evaluate the Condition:**
   - The condition in the `print` statement is `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x`.
   - This condition checks if both `l` and `r` are within `x` distance from `yb`.

5. **Determine the Output:**
   - If the condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` is true, the `print` statement will print `['Bob']`.
   - If the condition is false, the `print` statement will print `['Draw']`.

### Final Output:
- The `print` statement will print either `Draw` or `Bob` based on the evaluation of the condition.

Output: **Draw or Bob (depending on whether the condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` is true or false)**

This means the output will be either `Draw` or `Bob` depending on the specific values of `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `w`, and `h` provided in the input.
