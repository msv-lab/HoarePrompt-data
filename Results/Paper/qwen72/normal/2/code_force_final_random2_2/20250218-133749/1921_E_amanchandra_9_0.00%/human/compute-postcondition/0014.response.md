Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers from the input, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is equal to `(xb - xa) // 2`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is equal to `max(1, yb - x)` and `r` is equal to `min(w, yb + x)`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.***
