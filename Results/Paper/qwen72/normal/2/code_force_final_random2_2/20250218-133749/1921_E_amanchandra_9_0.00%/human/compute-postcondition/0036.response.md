Output State: **`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`, `l` is `max(1, ya - (abs(xa - xb) // 2))`, `r` is `min(w, yb + (abs(xa - xb) // 2))`**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is calculated as `min(w, yb + x)`.
- Since `x` is defined as `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`, the expression for `r` becomes `min(w, yb + (abs(xa - xb) // 2))`.
- All other variables (`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `i`, `t`, `x`, `l`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
