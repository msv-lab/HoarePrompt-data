Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers from the input.
- `i` is 1.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `x` is equal to the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2.
- `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`.
- `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `x`:**
   - `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`
   - This gives the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2.

2. **Calculate `l`:**
   - `l = max(1, yb - x)`
   - This ensures `l` is at least 1 and at most `yb - x`.

3. **Calculate `r`:**
   - `r = min(w, yb + x)`
   - This ensures `r` is at most `w` and at least `yb + x`.

4. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` needs to be evaluated.
   - If this condition is true, the second list `['Alice']` is selected.
   - If this condition is false, the first list `['Draw']` is selected.

5. **Print Statement:**
   - The `*` operator unpacks the selected list.
   - If the condition is true, it prints `'Alice'`.
   - If the condition is false, it prints `'Draw'`.

### Final Output:
Based on the given initial state and the condition, the output will be either `'Draw'` or `'Alice'` depending on the values of `l`, `r`, `ya`, and `x`.

Output: **'Draw' or 'Alice' (depending on the condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`)**

To provide a more precise answer, we need the specific values of `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `h`, and `w`. However, without these values, the output is determined by the condition described.
