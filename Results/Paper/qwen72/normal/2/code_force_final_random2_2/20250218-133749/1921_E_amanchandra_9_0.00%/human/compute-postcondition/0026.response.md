Postcondition: ***`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers from the input, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `x` is equal to the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2. If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is true (i.e., the difference is odd), `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. Otherwise, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.***
