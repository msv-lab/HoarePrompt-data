Output State: **`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers from the input, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0. No changes are made to `i` or `t`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())` reads six integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. The initial values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged. Since the conditions for setting `x`, `l`, and `r` are not evaluated in this snippet, these variables are not mentioned in the output state.
