The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, the integers `h` and `w` represent the dimensions of a grid, with `1 ≤ h ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9`. The coordinates `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` represent two distinct points on the grid, where `1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h` and `1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w`, and `(x_a, y_a) ≠ (x_b, y_b)`.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. However, the specific output for each test case is not explicitly described in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case includes six integers representing the dimensions of a grid and two distinct points on the grid. It returns a result for each test case, though the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
