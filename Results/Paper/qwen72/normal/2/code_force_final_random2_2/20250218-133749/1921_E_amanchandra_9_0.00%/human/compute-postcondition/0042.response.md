Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by six integers: `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. These integers represent the dimensions of a grid (`h` by `w`) and two distinct points on the grid (`(xa, ya)` and `(xb, yb)`). For each test case, the function determines and prints a result based on the relative positions of these points. If `xa` is greater than `xb`, the function prints "Draw". Otherwise, it calculates a value `x` and uses it to determine a range `[l, r]` on the grid. Depending on the parity of the distance between `xa` and `xb`, and the positions of `ya` and `yb` within the calculated range, the function prints either "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw". After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
