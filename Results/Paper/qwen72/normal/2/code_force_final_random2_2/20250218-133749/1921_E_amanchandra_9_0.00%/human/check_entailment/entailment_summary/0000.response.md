### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Immediate Draw:**
   - The function starts by checking if `xa` (Alice's row position) is greater than `xb` (Bob's row position). If this condition is true, it means Alice is already below Bob, and since Alice can only move down and Bob can only move up, they cannot meet. Thus, the function correctly prints "Draw".

2. **Calculating the Distance and Range:**
   - If `xa` is not greater than `xb`, the function calculates the distance `x` between Alice's and Bob's positions using `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`.
   - The function then checks the parity of the distance `abs(xa - xb)`. This is crucial because the parity determines whether Alice or Bob has the advantage in the game.

3. **Odd Distance Case:**
   - If the distance `abs(xa - xb)` is odd, the function calculates the range `[l, r]` where `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`. This range represents the possible columns where Alice can potentially win.
   - The function then checks if Alice's column `ya` is within the range `[l, r]` and if the distance from `ya` to the boundaries of the range is less than or equal to `x + 1`. If this condition is met, Alice can win, and the function prints "Alice". Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

4. **Even Distance Case:**
   - If the distance `abs(xa - xb)` is even, the function again calculates the range `[l, r]` but this time using `l = max(1, ya - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`.
   - The function then checks if Bob's column `yb` is within the range `[l, r]` and if the distance from `yb` to the boundaries of the range is less than or equal to `x`. If this condition is met, Bob can win, and the function prints "Bob". Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases where the board dimensions or initial positions might cause the range calculations to go out of bounds by using `max(1, ...)` and `min(w, ...)`.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where Alice or Bob cannot make a move due to being at the boundary of the board, which is implicitly handled by the range checks.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic to determine the outcome of the game based on the given rules and constraints. The reasoning and the implementation align with the problem description and the expected outcomes.
