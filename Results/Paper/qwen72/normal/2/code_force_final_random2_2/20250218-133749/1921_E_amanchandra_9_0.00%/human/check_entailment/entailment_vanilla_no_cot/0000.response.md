Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Logic for Determining the Outcome**: The logic used to determine the outcome of the game is flawed. Specifically, the way it calculates the `l` and `r` values and checks the conditions for a win or draw is not entirely correct. The conditions for determining whether Alice or Bob can force a win are not accurately represented.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when Alice or Bob is already in a position where they cannot make a move (e.g., Alice in the last row or Bob in the first row).

3. **Simplification of Conditions**: The conditions for checking if Alice or Bob can win should be simplified and more clearly defined. The current implementation is overly complex and may lead to incorrect results.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())
        
        # If Alice is below Bob, the game is a draw because Bob cannot reach Alice.
        if xa > xb:
            print("Draw")
            continue
        
        # Calculate the vertical distance between Alice and Bob.
        vertical_distance = xb - xa
        
        # Check if Alice can win by moving diagonally to Bob's position.
        if (ya - yb) % 2 == vertical_distance % 2 and abs(ya - yb) <= vertical_distance:
            print("Alice")
        else:
            print("Draw")

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Vertical Distance Calculation**: The vertical distance between Alice and Bob is calculated as `xb - xa`. This is the number of moves Bob needs to reach Alice's row.

2. **Winning Condition for Alice**: Alice can win if the difference in their y-coordinates (`ya - yb`) is even and within the vertical distance. This ensures that Alice can move diagonally to Bob's position.

3. **Draw Condition**: If the above condition is not met, the game is a draw.

This corrected solution should accurately determine the outcome of the game based on the given rules.
