The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state describes several variables (`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `i`, and `t`) but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the content of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Output: **Draw**
