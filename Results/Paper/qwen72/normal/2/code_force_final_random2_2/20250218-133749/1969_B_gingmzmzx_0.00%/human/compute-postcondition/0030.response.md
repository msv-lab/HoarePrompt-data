To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for c in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop head involves the variable `c` and the list `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be non-empty. The other variables (`t`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `n`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1
- `n` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous state)
- `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`
- `cnt` is [0, 0]
- `ans` is 0

For the loop to execute, `s` must have at least one element. The variable `c` will take the value of the first element in `s` during the first iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `s` is non-empty and `c` is the first element of `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 1 element, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is 0, `c` is the first element of `s`**
