Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, the sum of the lengths of lists over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is 0.** 

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.
