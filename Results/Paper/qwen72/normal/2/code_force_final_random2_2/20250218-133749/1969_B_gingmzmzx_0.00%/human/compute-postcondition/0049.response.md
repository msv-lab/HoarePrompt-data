The only object in the loop head is the variable `n`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the original `s`, `cnt` is [number of 0s in `s`, number of 1s in `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of 0s in `s` multiplied by the number of 1s in `s`**
