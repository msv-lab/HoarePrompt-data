The code snippet resets the `cnt` list to `[0, 0]`. This means that the count of 0s and 1s in the list `s` is reset to zero. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 (updated from input), `n` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous state), `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s in the original `s` multiplied by the number of 0s in the original `s`.**
