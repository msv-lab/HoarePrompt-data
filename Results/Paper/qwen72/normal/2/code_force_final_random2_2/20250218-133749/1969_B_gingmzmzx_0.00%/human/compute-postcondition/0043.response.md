The value of `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. Since `c` is the third element of `s`, which can be either 0 or 1, the specific value of `cnt[c]` will depend on the value of `c`.

- If `c` is 0, `cnt` was initially `[2, 0]`, so `cnt[0]` becomes 3, and `cnt` is now `[3, 0]`.
- If `c` is 1, `cnt` was initially `[0, 2]`, so `cnt[1]` becomes 3, and `cnt` is now `[0, 3]`.

The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 3 elements, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`, `c` is the third element of `s`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [3, 0] and `ans` is 0. If `c` is 1, `cnt` is [0, 3] and `ans` is `2 * zeroes`.**
