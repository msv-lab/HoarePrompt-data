Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `n` is 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the final `s`, `cnt` is [number of 0s in the final `s`, number of 1s in the final `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s before each 0 in the final `s` plus the product of the number of 0s and the number of 1s in the final `s`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`s`**: After the loop completes, `s` will be the last binary string input provided during the loop's execution.
- **`n`**: This variable is decremented with each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `n` will be 0.
- **`zeroes`**: This variable holds the count of 0s in the final `s` after the loop has completed.
- **`cnt`**: This list contains the counts of 0s and 1s in the final `s`.
- **`ans`**: This variable holds the final computed value, which is the sum of the number of 1s before each 0 in the final `s` plus the product of the number of 0s and the number of 1s in the final `s`.
