Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string is already sorted. According to the problem description, if the string is already sorted, the output should be 0. However, the current implementation will still calculate a non-zero cost even if the string is already sorted. For example, for the input "0000", the program will incorrectly output a non-zero value instead of 0.
