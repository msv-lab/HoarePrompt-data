Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 (updated from input), `n` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous state), `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is explicitly set to 0.
- The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1 from its previous state, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`, and `cnt` is [0, 0].
- The only change is that `ans` is now 0.
