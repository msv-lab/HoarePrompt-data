To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the list `ans` step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `tc` is 0.
   - `n` and `k` are integers input by the user.
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\).

2. **Construction of the List `ans`:**
   - The list `ans` is constructed as follows:
     - First, it contains the values `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
     - Then, it contains all powers of 2 from `1` to `2^19` except `2^i`.

3. **Explanation of the Values:**
   - `1 << i` is equivalent to \(2^i\).
   - The first three elements of `ans` are:
     - `k - (1 << i)`: This is `k` minus \(2^i\).
     - `k + 1`: This is `k` plus 1.
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: This is `k` plus 1 plus \(2^i\).
   - The remaining elements of `ans` are all powers of 2 from `1` to `2^19` except \(2^i\).

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

Given the above steps, the output will be:

Output: **k - 2^i, k + 1, k + 1 + 2^i, 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^19 (excluding 2^i)**

Where:
- `k - 2^i` is the value of `k` minus \(2^i\).
- `k + 1` is the value of `k` plus 1.
- `k + 1 + 2^i` is the value of `k` plus 1 plus \(2^i\).
- The list includes all powers of 2 from `1` to `2^19` except \(2^i\).
