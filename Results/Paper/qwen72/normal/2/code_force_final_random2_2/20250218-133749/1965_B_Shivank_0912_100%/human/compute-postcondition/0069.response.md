Output State: **`k` is an integer input by the user, `i` is the largest integer such that \(1 << i \leq k\), `t`, `tc`, and `n` remain unchanged, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << 2]`, `j` is 2.**

Explanation: The value `1 << j` (which is `1 << 2` or `4`) is appended to the list `ans`. The value of `j` is specified as 2. All other variables (`k`, `i`, `t`, `tc`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
