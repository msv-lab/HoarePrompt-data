The only objects in the loop head are the variable `tc` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, ensuring that the loop will execute if `t` is within this range. The variable `tc` should start at 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tc` is 0**
