To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the list `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `tc` is initialized to 0.
- `n` and `k` are integers input by the user.
- `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\).

### Construction of `ans`:
- The list `ans` is constructed as follows:
  - It starts with the values `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
  - It then includes all powers of 2 from `1` to `2^19` except `2^i`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `i`**:
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\). This means \(i\) is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Construct the initial part of `ans`**:
   - The first three elements of `ans` are `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
   - Here, `(1 << i)` is equivalent to \(2^i\).

3. **Construct the remaining part of `ans`**:
   - The list `ans` then includes all powers of 2 from `1` to `2^19` except `2^i`.
   - The powers of 2 from `1` to `2^19` are: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.
   - Since `2^i` is excluded, the number of elements in this part of the list is `20 - 1 = 19`.

4. **Calculate the total length of `ans`**:
   - The total length of `ans` is the sum of the lengths of the two parts:
     - The first part has 3 elements.
     - The second part has 19 elements.
   - Therefore, the total length of `ans` is \(3 + 19 = 22\).

### Final Output:
The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the length of the list `ans`, which is 22.

Output: **22**
