The code snippet `ans.append(1 << j)` appends the value of `1 << j` to the list `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `k` is an integer input by the user.
- `i` is the largest integer such that \(1 << i \leq k\).
- `t`, `tc`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is initially `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
- If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is extended by appending `1` to it, and `j` is 1.

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. **`ans.append(1 << j)`**:
   - This line appends the value of `1 << j` to the list `ans`.
   - Since `j` is 1, `1 << j` evaluates to `1 << 1`, which is `2`.

2. **Update `ans`**:
   - The initial `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
   - After appending `2`, `ans` becomes `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 2]`.

3. **Other variables**:
   - `k`, `i`, `t`, `tc`, and `n` remain unchanged.
   - `j` remains 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`k` is an integer input by the user, `i` is the largest integer such that \(1 << i \leq k\), `t`, `tc`, and `n` remain unchanged, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 2]`, `j` is 1.**
