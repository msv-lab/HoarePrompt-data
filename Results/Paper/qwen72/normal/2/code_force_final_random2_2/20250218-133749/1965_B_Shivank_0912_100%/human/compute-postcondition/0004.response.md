To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The variables in the loop condition are `i` and `k`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `tc` is 0.
   - `n` and `k` are integers input by the user.
   - `i` is 0.

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `1 << i + 1 <= k`.
   - Substituting `i` with 0, the condition becomes `1 << 0 + 1 <= k`, which simplifies to `1 << 1 <= k`.
   - `1 << 1` is equivalent to `2`, so the condition becomes `2 <= k`.

4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.

### Conclusion:
- The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `k` is greater than or equal to 2.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `i` is 0, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2**.
