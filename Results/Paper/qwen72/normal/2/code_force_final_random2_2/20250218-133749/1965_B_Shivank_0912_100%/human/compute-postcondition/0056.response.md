Output State: **`k` is an integer input by the user (at least 2), `i` is increased by 2**. 

Explanation: The value of `i` was already increased by 1 according to the initial state. The code snippet `i = i + 1` further increases `i` by 1, making the total increase in `i` 2. The value of `k` remains unchanged.
