The provided code snippet reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. This impacts the initial state by updating the values of `n` and `k` to the new values provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `tc`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `k` is an integer input by the user, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\), and `ans` contains the values `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` followed by all powers of 2 from `1` to `2^19` except `2^i`.**
