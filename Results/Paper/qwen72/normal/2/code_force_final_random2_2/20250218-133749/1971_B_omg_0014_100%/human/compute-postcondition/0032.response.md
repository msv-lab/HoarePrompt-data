The code snippet `b = ''.join(sorted(s))` sorts the characters in the string `s` in ascending order and assigns the result to the variable `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `s` is a new string input by the user
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, the length of `a` remains 1. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `b` is a string containing the characters of the new `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is a string containing the characters of the new `s` sorted in descending order. If `s` is equal to `b`, then `s` is sorted in ascending order; otherwise, `s` is not sorted in ascending order.

After executing the code snippet:
- `b` is now a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in ascending order.
- All other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a new string input by the user, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, the length of `a` remains 1. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `b` is a string containing the characters of the new `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is a string containing the characters of the new `s` sorted in descending order. If `s` is equal to `b`, then `s` is sorted in ascending order; otherwise, `s` is not sorted in ascending order.**
