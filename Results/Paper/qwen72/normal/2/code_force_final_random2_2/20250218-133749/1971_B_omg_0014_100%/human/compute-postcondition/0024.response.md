Based on the initial state:

- `s` is a new string input by the user.
- `b` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in ascending order.

Given this information, the `print(b)` statement will print the characters of the string `s` sorted in ascending order.

Output: **b (where b is the string s with its characters sorted in ascending order)**
