Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string input by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, the length of `a` is greater than 1, `b` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in descending order. If `s` is equal to `b`, then `s` is sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, `s` is not sorted in ascending order.***
