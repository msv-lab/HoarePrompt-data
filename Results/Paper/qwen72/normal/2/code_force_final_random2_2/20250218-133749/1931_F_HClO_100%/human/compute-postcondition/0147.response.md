The given initial state mentions that `_` is `m - 2`, where `m` is greater than 2, and the program waits for user input. However, the `print` statement does not depend on these variables or the user input; it simply prints a static string.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('no')
```

This statement will print the string `'no'` regardless of the values of `_` or `m`.

Output: **no**
