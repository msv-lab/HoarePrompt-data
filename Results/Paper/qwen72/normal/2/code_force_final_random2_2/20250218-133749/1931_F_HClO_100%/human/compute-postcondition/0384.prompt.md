Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted screenshots, respectively. Each of the following k lines contains n distinct integers a_{ij} (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n), representing the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0}, who is the author of the screenshot and appears at the top of their own list. All authors of the screenshots are different.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if m == 1:
        input()
        print('yes')
        continue
    a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())
    a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())
    l11 = [i for i in l1 if i != a2]
    l22 = [i for i in l2 if i != a1]
    if l11 != l22:
        for _ in range(m - 2):
            input()
        print('no')
        continue
    idx1 = idx2 = -1
    p1 = p2 = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
            break
        if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
                idx1 = idx2 = i
                break
            else:
                if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                    idx1 = i
                    p1 = 1
                else:
                    idx2 = i
                    p2 = 1
                if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                    break
    val = []
    if idx1 == -1 and idx2 != -1:
        idx1 = n - 2
    if idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1:
        idx2 = n - 2
    if idx1 < idx2:
        l2.insert(idx1, a2)
        l = l2
    elif idx1 > idx2:
        l1.insert(idx2, a1)
        l = l1
    else:
        if m == 2:
            print('yes')
            continue
        a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
        if l3.index(a1) < l3.index(a2):
            l1.insert(idx2, a1)
            l = l1
        else:
            l2.insert(idx1, a2)
            l = l2
        val.append((a3, l3))
        m -= 1
    for _ in range(m - 2):
        a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
        val.append((a3, l3))
    for a3, l3 in val:
        if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
            print('no')
            break
    else:
        print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop has executed `m - 2` times, `m - 2` input operations have occurred, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were before the last iteration, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from each new input, and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each new input. If any `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the loop breaks and prints 'no'. Otherwise, the loop completes and prints 'yes'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing 0 tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is undefined (as there are no more tuples in `val`), `l3` is undefined (as there are no more tuples in `val`), `_` is `m - 3`. The loop has completed all iterations without breaking, so the final output is 'yes'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has completed all iterations, and no 'break' statements were triggered, so the final output is 'yes'. The variables `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `val`, `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `_`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` retain their values as described in the initial state, with the additional condition that for every tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val`, `l3` is equal to the list of elements from `l` excluding `a3`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
