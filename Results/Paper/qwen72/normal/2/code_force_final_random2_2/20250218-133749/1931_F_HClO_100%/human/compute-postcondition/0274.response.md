Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n - 2`
- `p1` is 1
- `p2` is 1
- `idx1` is `n - 3`
- `val` is a list containing 0 tuples `(a3, l3)`
- `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions
- `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` must be greater than 2
- `a3` is undefined
- `l3` is undefined
- `_` is 0
- `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`
- `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1`
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input line
- `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2`
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`
- All `m - 2` lines of input have been consumed

The print statement is:
```python
print('no')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
