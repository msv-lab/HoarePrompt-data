The code snippet `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `p1` is 1
- `p2` is 1
- `idx1` is `n - 3`
- `val` is a list containing one or two tuples `(a3, l3)`
- `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions
- `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions
- `m` is greater than 2
- `a3` is the first integer from user input
- `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining user input
- `_` is 1

After executing the code snippet:
- `a3` is updated to the first integer from the new user input.
- `l3` is updated to a list of integers from the remaining parts of the new user input.

The values of the other variables (`i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `val`, `idx2`, `l`, `m`, `_`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing one or two tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the new user input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining parts of the new user input, `_` is 1.**
