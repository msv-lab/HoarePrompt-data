Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to correctly process and validate the order of participants in scenarios where the number of screenshots \( k \) is greater than 2 and the order of participants in the screenshots is more complex.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 3 4 5
3 2 1 4 5
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

In this example, the first user sees the order `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the second user sees the order `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]`, and the third user sees the order `[3, 2, 1, 4, 5]`. These orders are consistent with the problem description, but the program incorrectly outputs `NO`.

The issue arises because the program's logic for comparing and validating the orders of participants is not robust enough to handle all possible permutations and edge cases, especially when \( k > 2 \). The program fails to correctly account for the relative positions of participants in the screenshots, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
