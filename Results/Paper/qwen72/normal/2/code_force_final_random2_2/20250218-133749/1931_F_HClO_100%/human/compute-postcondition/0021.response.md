Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` and `m` are input integers where `m` must be greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, and `l11` is not equal to `l22`. The loop has executed `m - 2` times, and `m - 2` input operations have occurred. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
