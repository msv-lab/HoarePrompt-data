Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` is either 0 or -1, `idx2` is either 0 or -1, `val` is a list containing 0 tuples `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, `_` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, all `m - 2` lines of input have been consumed. If the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is equal to `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
