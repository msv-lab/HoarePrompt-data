Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum value between `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0.**

Explanation: The variables `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to the value of `i`, which is 0. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged from the initial state.
