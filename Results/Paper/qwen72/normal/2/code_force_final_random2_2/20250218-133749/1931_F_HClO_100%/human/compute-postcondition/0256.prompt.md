Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the last user input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining parts of the last user input, `_` is `m - 3`.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the last user input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining parts of the last user input, `_` is `m - 3`. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as per the original flow.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing `m - 3` tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the next tuple in `val`, `l3` is the list of integers from the remaining parts of the next tuple in `val`, `_` is `m - 3`. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing `m - 3` tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the next tuple in `val`, `l3` is the list of integers from the remaining parts of the next tuple in `val`, `_` is `m - 3`. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
