The `input()` function call waits for user input and consumes one line of input. However, since no variable is assigned to store the result of `input()`, the input is discarded and does not affect the state of the program. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers where `m` must be greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, and `l11` is not equal to `l22`.**
