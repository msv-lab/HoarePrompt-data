The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the value `m - 2`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m - 2`. If `_` is less than `m - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `m` is greater than 2, meaning `m - 2` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` should be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `m - 2` must still be greater than 1 (since `m` is greater than 2, `m - 2` is at least 1, but for another iteration, it needs to be at least 2).

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop has executed `m - 2` times, `m - 2` input operations have occurred, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were before the last iteration, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the third input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the third input.**
