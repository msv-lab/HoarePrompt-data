To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.
3. **Initial State of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n`**: Ensure `n` is greater than 1.
- **`i`**: Initialize `i` to 0.

### Final State:
The state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. Therefore, the final state should be:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop has executed `m - 2` times, and `m - 2` input operations have occurred, the loop continues to the next iteration, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0**.
