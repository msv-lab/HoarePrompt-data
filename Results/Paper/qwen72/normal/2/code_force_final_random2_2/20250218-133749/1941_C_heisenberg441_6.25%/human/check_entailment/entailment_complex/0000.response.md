Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of making a string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters to eliminate the substrings "map" and "pie". The logic of the program is as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself.
3. It calls the function `func_1` with the string as an argument.
4. Inside `func_1`:
   - There is a special case check for the string being exactly "mapie", which is handled by returning 1. However, this specific check is unnecessary because the general logic of the function will correctly handle this case by removing "map" and "pie" substrings.
   - The function uses a loop to find and remove all occurrences of the substring "map" from the string, incrementing a counter `ans` for each removal.
   - Another loop is used to find and remove all occurrences of the substring "pie" from the string, also incrementing the counter `ans` for each removal.
   - Finally, the function returns the total count of removals.

However, there is a logical flaw in the implementation:
- When removing the substring "map", the function only removes the first two characters ("ma") instead of all three characters. This means that after removing "ma", the remaining part of the string still starts with "p", which could potentially form another "pie" or "map" if more characters are present.
- Similarly, when removing the substring "pie", the function only removes the first two characters ("pi"), leaving the last character "e".

This incorrect removal process can lead to incorrect results, especially in cases where the substrings overlap or are closely positioned.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the flawed removal logic.

Correctness: **False**
