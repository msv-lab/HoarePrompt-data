Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by iteratively removing occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" from the input string `s`. The goal is to minimize the number of deletions required to make the string beautiful, which means the string should not contain either "map" or "pie".

1. **Initial Check for Special Case**: The program starts with a special check for the string "mapie". This is unnecessary because the logic that follows should handle this case correctly without needing a special condition. However, this does not affect the correctness of the solution for other cases.

2. **Removing "map" Substrings**: The program uses a `while` loop to find and remove all occurrences of the substring "map" from `s`. Each time an occurrence is found, the program removes the first two characters of "map" and increments the counter `ans` by 1. This is correct because removing the first two characters of "map" effectively removes the entire substring "map" from the string.

3. **Removing "pie" Substrings**: Similarly, the program uses another `while` loop to find and remove all occurrences of the substring "pie" from `s`. Each time an occurrence is found, the program removes the first two characters of "pie" and increments the counter `ans` by 1. This is also correct for the same reason as above.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, the program returns the total number of deletions performed, which is stored in `ans`.

However, there is a minor issue in the implementation:
- When removing "map" or "pie", the program only removes the first two characters of the substring. This is incorrect because it leaves the last character of the substring in the string, which could lead to incorrect results if the remaining part of the string forms another "map" or "pie" substring.

To fix this, the program should remove the entire substring "map" or "pie" at once, not just the first two characters. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    if (s == 'mapie'):
        return 1
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 3:]  # Remove the entire "map"
        ans += 1
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 3:]  # Remove the entire "pie"
        ans += 1
    return ans
```

Given the original program's logic, the special case check for "mapie" is redundant and can be removed without affecting the correctness. However, the main issue is the incorrect removal of substrings, which would lead to incorrect results.

Therefore, the original program is **incorrect** due to the improper handling of substring removal.

Correctness: **False**
