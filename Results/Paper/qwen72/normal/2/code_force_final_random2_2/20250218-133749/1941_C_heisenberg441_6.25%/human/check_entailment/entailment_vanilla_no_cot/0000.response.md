Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it only handles specific cases of the substrings "map" and "pie" by removing them one at a time. However, it does not consider the optimal way to remove characters to avoid these substrings, which might involve removing fewer characters by strategically choosing which characters to delete.

For example, in the string "mmapnapie", the current solution will remove the first "map" and then the "pie", resulting in 2 deletions. However, the optimal solution would be to remove the 'n' and 'a' characters to break the "map" and "pie" substrings with only 2 deletions, but in a different way than the provided solution suggests.

Additionally, the special case `if s == 'mapie': return 1` is unnecessary and incorrect, as it does not generalize to other similar cases and can be handled by the main logic.

A correct approach would involve a more sophisticated algorithm to find the minimum number of deletions required to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring. This could involve dynamic programming or a greedy approach to carefully select which characters to remove.
