Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. `s` is not equal to 'mapie', must contain the substring 'p', and no longer contains the substring 'map'. `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet removes the first occurrence of the substring 'map' from `s` by slicing the string up to the index before 'map' starts and concatenating it with the part of the string starting from the index right after 'ma'. As a result, `s` no longer contains the substring 'map', but it still meets the other conditions specified in the initial state. The value of `ans` remains unchanged.
