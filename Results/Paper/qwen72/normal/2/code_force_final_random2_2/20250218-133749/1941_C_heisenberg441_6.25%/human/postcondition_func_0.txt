The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns an integer. If the string `s` is exactly 'mapie', the function returns 1. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' from `s`, counting the total number of removals. The function then returns this count. After the function concludes, the string `s` will no longer contain the substrings 'map' or 'pie', and the returned value represents the total number of times these substrings were removed from `s`.
