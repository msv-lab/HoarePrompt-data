Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to provide a valid solution when `n` is much larger than `k` and `k` is greater than 1. For example, consider the input `n = 1000` and `k = 50`. According to the problem description, Bob should be able to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 50 jewels. However, the current implementation only considers a few specific cases and does not generate a valid solution for this input. The program outputs "NO" for this case, which is incorrect because it is possible to set up stalls to achieve the desired outcome. For instance, Bob could set up 50 stalls, each with a price of 20 coins, allowing Alice to buy exactly 50 jewels. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
