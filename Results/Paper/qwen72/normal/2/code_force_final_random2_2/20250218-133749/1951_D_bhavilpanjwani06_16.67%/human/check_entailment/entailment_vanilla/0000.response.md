### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case using a loop.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle each test case. It reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input.

3. **Initial Check**: The program checks if `n < k`. If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it is impossible, and the program prints "NO".

4. **Exact Match**: If `n == k`, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up one stall with the price equal to `n`. The program prints "YES", followed by the number of stalls (1) and the price (n).

5. **Greedy Approach**:
   - The program checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. This condition ensures that Alice can buy `k-1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall.
   - If this condition is true, the program prints "YES", followed by the number of stalls (2) and the prices (`n - k + 1` and 1).
   - If the condition is false, the program prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the base cases where `n < k` and `n == k`.
- For the case where `n > k`, the program uses a greedy approach to check if it is possible to set up two stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. This approach is valid because:
  - If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, Alice can buy `k-1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall.
  - If `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`, it is not possible to set up two stalls to achieve the desired result, so the program prints "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
