The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides context about the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is equal to `k`.

The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
