### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case using a loop. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle each test case. It reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input. This is also correct.

3. **Initial Check**: The program checks if `n < k`. If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it is impossible, and the program prints "NO". This is a valid check.

4. **Exact Match**: If `n == k`, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up one stall with the price equal to `n`. The program prints "YES", followed by the number of stalls (1) and the price (n). This is also correct.

5. **Greedy Approach**:
   - The program checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. This condition ensures that Alice can buy `k-1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall.
   - If this condition is true, the program prints "YES", followed by the number of stalls (2) and the prices (`n - k + 1` and 1).
   - If the condition is false, the program prints "NO".

However, the greedy approach used in the program is not comprehensive enough to cover all possible scenarios. Specifically, the program only considers two stalls, but the problem allows for up to 60 stalls. This means that the program might miss valid solutions where more than two stalls are needed.

### Counterexample:
Consider the case where `n = 10` and `k = 5`. According to the program:
- `n < k` is false.
- `n == k` is false.
- `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is `4 < 6`, which is true.
- The program prints "YES" with 2 stalls and prices `6` and `1`.

However, a valid solution with more than two stalls could be:
- 5 stalls with prices `2, 2, 2, 2, 2`.

This solution would also ensure that Alice buys exactly 5 jewels, but the program does not consider this possibility.

### Conclusion:
The program is not comprehensive enough to cover all possible scenarios where more than two stalls might be needed. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
