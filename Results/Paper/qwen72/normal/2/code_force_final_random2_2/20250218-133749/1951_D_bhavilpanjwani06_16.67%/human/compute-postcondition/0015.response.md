Postcondition: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n and k are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively. Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k, and n is not equal to k. If \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \), then the condition \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \) holds true. Otherwise, \( k - 1 \geq n - k + 1 \).**
