Output State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, but with the characters at indices `right` and `left` swapped, `s[right]` is now the character that was originally at `left`, `s[left]` is now the character that was originally at `right`, `cost` is 0, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, and `left` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `s` or the length of `s` if no '1' is found.**
