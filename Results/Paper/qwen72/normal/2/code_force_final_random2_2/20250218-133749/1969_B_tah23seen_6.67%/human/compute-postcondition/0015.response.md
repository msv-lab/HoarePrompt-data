Postcondition: ***`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', the first two characters of `s` are swapped, `cost` is 2, and `s[right]` is '1' while `s[left]` is '0'. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged, `cost` is 0, and `i` is the last character of `sChar`.***
