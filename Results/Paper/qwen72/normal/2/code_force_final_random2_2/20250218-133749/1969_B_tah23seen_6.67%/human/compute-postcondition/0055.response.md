Output State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `right` is now `right + 2`, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, `left` is an index such that `left <= right` and `left < len(s)`, and `s[right]` must not be '0' (if `right` was less than `len(s)` before the increment).**

Explanation:
- The value of `right` is incremented by 1 again, making it `right + 2` from its original value.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
