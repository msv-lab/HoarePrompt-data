Output State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `right` is now the smallest index such that `s[right]` is '0' or `right` is equal to `len(s)`, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, `left` is an index such that `left <= right` and `left < len(s)`, and `s[left]` must be '1'.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `left` will point to the first occurrence of '1' in the list `s` starting from the initial position of `left`. If no '1' is found before reaching the end of the list, `left` will be equal to `len(s)`. The conditions for `sChar`, `s`, `right`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
