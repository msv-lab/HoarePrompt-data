The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `sChar`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `sChar`. If there are more characters left in `sChar`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2, `s` is a list containing the first two characters of `sChar`, and `i` is the second character of `sChar`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sChar` must have at least 3 characters, and `i` will be set to the next character in `sChar`.

State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 3, `s` is a list containing the first two characters of `sChar`, `i` is the third character of `sChar`**
