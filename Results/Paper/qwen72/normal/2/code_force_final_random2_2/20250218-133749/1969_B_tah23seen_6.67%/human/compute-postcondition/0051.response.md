Postcondition: ***`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', the characters at indices `left` and `right` in `s` are swapped, and `cost` is increased by `right - left + 1`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged and `cost` is not modified. `right` is an index such that `right < len(s)`, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, and `left` is an index such that `left <= right` and `left < len(s)`.***
