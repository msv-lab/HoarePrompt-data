You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        max = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
                max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])
        print(max)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        max = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
                max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])
        
        print(max)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0, and for each test case, `n` was an input integer, `a` was a list of integers from user input, `i` reached `n-1`, and `max` was the maximum value among all the minimum values of pairs `(a[j], a[j-1])` for `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then finds the maximum value among the minimum values of consecutive pairs in the list `a`. Finally, it prints this maximum value for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array has more than two elements and the maximum possible value of the final number is not among the adjacent pairs. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 4 3 5
```

The correct output should be `4`, because Mocha can perform the following operations:

- Choose the interval (l, r) = (2, 4), then the array becomes `[1, 3, 3, 3, 5]`.
- Choose the interval (l, r) = (1, 5), then the array becomes `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`.

However, the program will output `3` because it only considers the minimum of adjacent pairs, which does not necessarily lead to the maximum possible value after all operations. Thus, the program is incorrect.
