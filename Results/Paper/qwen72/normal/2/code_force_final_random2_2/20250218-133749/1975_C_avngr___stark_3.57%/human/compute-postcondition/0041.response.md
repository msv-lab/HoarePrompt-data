Postcondition: ***`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the new user input, `i` is managed by the loop, and `max` is updated to the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` if this minimum is greater than the previous `max`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.***
