Output State: **`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than `k + 2`, `a` is a list of integers from the new user input, `i` is `k + 2`, `max` is the minimum value between `a[k + 2]` and `a[k + 1]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `max` is updated to the minimum value between `a[k + 2]` and `a[k + 1]`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
