The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in a list called `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer

After executing the code:
- `a` is a list of integers, where each integer is derived from the input provided by the user.

The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input.**
