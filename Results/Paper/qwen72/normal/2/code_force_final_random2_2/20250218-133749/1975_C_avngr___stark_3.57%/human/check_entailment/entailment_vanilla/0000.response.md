### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum possible value that all elements in the array can be made equal to using the given operations.
   - The operations involve selecting a subarray, finding its median, and setting all elements in the subarray to this median.
   - The goal is to maximize the final value of the array after performing these operations.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The provided solution iterates through the array and keeps track of the maximum value of the minimum of adjacent pairs.
   - The logic is based on the observation that the final value of the array can be at most the minimum of any two adjacent elements in the array.
   - This is because, in any subarray, the median will be at least as large as the minimum of the smallest two elements in the subarray.

3. **Checking the Implementation:**
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `a`.
   - It initializes `max` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to `n-1`, comparing each pair of adjacent elements.
   - If the minimum of the current pair is greater than the current `max`, it updates `max`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `max`.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:**
     - Input: `2\n2\n1 2`
     - Output: `1`
     - Explanation: The only possible operation is to choose the interval (1, 2), resulting in the array `[1, 1]`. The maximum value is `1`.
   - **Example 2:**
     - Input: `2\n5\n1 2 3 4 5`
     - Output: `4`
     - Explanation: The operations can be performed as described in the problem statement, resulting in the array `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`. The maximum value is `4`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The solution correctly identifies the maximum possible value that all elements in the array can be made equal to using the given operations.
   - The logic and implementation are sound and match the problem requirements.
