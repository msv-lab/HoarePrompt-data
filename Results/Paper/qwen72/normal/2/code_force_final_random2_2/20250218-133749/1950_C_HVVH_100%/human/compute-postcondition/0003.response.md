The code snippet reads a string input in the format "hh:mm" and splits it into two parts, converting them to integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `h` and `m`. The initial state variables `t`, `s`, `day`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` and `m` are integers representing the hour and minute from the input string respectively.**
