The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of time conversions to perform. For each conversion, it reads a time in the format "hh:mm" and converts it to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation, printing the converted time. The function does not return any value; its primary action is to print the converted times. After the function concludes, `n` is 0, and the input times have been processed and printed in the 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.
