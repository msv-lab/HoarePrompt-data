Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` must be greater than 0, `h` and `m` are integers representing the hour and minute from the input string respectively, and `h` is not equal to 0. If `h` > 12, `day` is 'PM', and `h` is updated to `h - 12`. Otherwise, `day` is 'AM' unless `h` is 12, in which case `day` is 'PM'.***
