Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `h` and `m` are integers representing the hour and minute from the input string `s` respectively.
- If `h` is 0, `h` is updated to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'.
- If `h` is greater than 12, `day` is set to 'PM' and `h` is updated to `h - 12`.
- If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'.
- Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Extracting `h` and `m` from `s`:**
   - `s` is in the format "hh:mm".
   - `h` is the hour part (first two characters).
   - `m` is the minute part (last two characters).

2. **Determining `day` and Adjusting `h`:**
   - If `h` is 0, it is updated to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, `day` is set to 'PM' and `h` is updated to `h - 12`.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.

3. **Formatting the Output:**
   - The print statement uses f-string formatting to display the time in the format "hh:mm" with leading zeros if necessary.
   - It also appends the value of `day`.

### Example Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1: `s = "00:30"`**
  - `h = 0`, `m = 30`
  - Since `h` is 0, `h` is updated to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'.
  - Output: **12:30 AM**

- **Scenario 2: `s = "13:45"`**
  - `h = 13`, `m = 45`
  - Since `h` is greater than 12, `h` is updated to 13 - 12 = 1 and `day` is set to 'PM'.
  - Output: **01:45 PM**

- **Scenario 3: `s = "12:00"`**
  - `h = 12`, `m = 00`
  - Since `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'.
  - Output: **12:00 PM**

- **Scenario 4: `s = "07:15"`**
  - `h = 7`, `m = 15`
  - Since `h` is neither 0 nor greater than 12, `day` remains 'AM'.
  - Output: **07:15 AM**

### General Output:
Based on the initial state and the logic described, the print statement will output the time in the format "hh:mm" followed by 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the conditions applied to `h`.

Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day} (where h and m are the hour and minute extracted from the input string s, and day is determined based on the conditions described)**
