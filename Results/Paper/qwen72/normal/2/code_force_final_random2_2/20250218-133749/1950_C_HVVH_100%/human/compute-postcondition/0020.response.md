The code snippet `h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))` reads a string input in the format "hh:mm", splits it into two parts using the colon `:` as a delimiter, and converts these parts into integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `h` and `m`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440
- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `h` and `m` are integers representing the hour and minute from the input string respectively
- If `h` is 0, `h` is updated to 12 and `day` is 'AM'
- If `h` is greater than 12, `day` is 'PM' and `h` is updated to `h - 12`
- If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'
- Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'
- `n` is now `n - 1`

After executing the code snippet:
- `h` and `m` are updated to the integer values of the hour and minute from the input string.
- The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `day`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` must be greater than 0, `h` and `m` are integers representing the hour and minute from the input string respectively, `n` is now `n - 1`, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions provided.**
