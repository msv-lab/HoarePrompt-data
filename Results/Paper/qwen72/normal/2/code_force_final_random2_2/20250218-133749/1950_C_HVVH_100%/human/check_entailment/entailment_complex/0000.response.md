Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It processes the input as specified, converting hours appropriately and setting the correct AM/PM indicator. The logic for handling the special cases (e.g., 00:00 becoming 12:00 AM, 12:00 becoming 12:00 PM) is also implemented correctly. The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one, printing the results in the required format. There are no apparent logical errors or issues with the handling of the input and output formats.

Correctness: **True**
