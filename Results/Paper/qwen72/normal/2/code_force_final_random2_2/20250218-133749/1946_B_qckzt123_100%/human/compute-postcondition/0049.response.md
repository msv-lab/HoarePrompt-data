The code snippet `tmp += x` increments the value of `tmp` by the value of `x`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `tmp` or `x`. Therefore, we can only describe the change in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `tmp` is increased by `x`.**
