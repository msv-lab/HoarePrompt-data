Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the array `a` and the number of operations, respectively. `a` is a list of `n` integers where -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, representing the array `a`. The sum of the values of `n` and `k` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `MOD` is 1000000007.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
    s = sum(a)
    t, tmp = 0, 0
    for x in a:
        tmp += x
        if tmp < 0:
            tmp = 0
        t = max(tmp, t)
    ans = ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD
    for i in range(k - 1):
        t *= 2
        t %= MOD
        ans += t
        ans %= MOD
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(2^(k-1) * t) % MOD`, `tmp` is the current running sum that does not drop below zero, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (2 * t) % MOD + (4 * t) % MOD + ... + (2^(k-2) * t) % MOD` modulo `MOD`, `i` is `k-2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be the maximum value of the cumulative sums of the subarrays of `a` that do not drop below zero, multiplied by \(2^{(k-1)}\) and taken modulo `MOD`. The variable `tmp` will be the last cumulative sum of the subarray being considered, which may be zero if it dropped below zero. The values of `s`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. `ans` is now equal to `((s + t * (2^(k-1))) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. `i` is `k-2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `k-2`, `t` is `(t * (2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
