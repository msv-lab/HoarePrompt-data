Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `tmp` is increased by `x` (if `tmp` was initially less than 0, `tmp` is set to 0), `t` is updated to the maximum value between the new `tmp` and the original `t`.**

Explanation:
- `a` remains unchanged and must have at least one element.
- `tmp` is increased by `x`. If `tmp` was initially less than 0, it is set to 0.
- `t` is updated to the maximum value between the new `tmp` and the original `t`. This means `t` will be the larger of the two values.
