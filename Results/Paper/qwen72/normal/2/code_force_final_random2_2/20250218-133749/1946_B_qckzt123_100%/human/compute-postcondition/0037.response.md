The value of `t` is multiplied by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is now `2 * ((4 * t) % MOD) % MOD`, `tmp` is the current running sum that does not drop below zero, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (4 * t) % MOD` % `MOD + t` % `MOD`, `i` is 2.**
