The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `k - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `k` must still be greater than or equal to 2 for the condition `i < k - 1` to hold true.

State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is `t % MOD`, `ans` is `ans % MOD`**
