The value of `tmp` is incremented by the value of `x`, which is the second element in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `x` and 0, `x` is the second element in the list `a`, `tmp` is now `tmp + x`.**
