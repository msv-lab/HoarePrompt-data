Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `t` is `(t * 4) % MOD`, `ans` is `(ans + t) % MOD`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `k` remains greater than or equal to 3.
- The value of `t` is updated to `(t * 4) % MOD`.
- The value of `ans` is updated to `(ans + t) % MOD`.

Since the code snippet only updates `ans` by adding the current value of `t` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`, the output state reflects these changes while keeping the other variables unchanged.
