The value of `t` is updated to `t % MOD`. This operation does not change the value of `t` because `t` was already `(t % MOD) * 2` in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is now `(t % MOD) * 2`, `tmp` is the last cumulative sum of the subarray being considered, which may be zero if it dropped below zero, `s` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` must be greater than 2, `ans` is now equal to `((s + (t % MOD) * 2 * 2) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is 2.**
