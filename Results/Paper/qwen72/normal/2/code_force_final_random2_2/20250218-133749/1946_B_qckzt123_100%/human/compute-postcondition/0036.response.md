The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `k-1`. If `i` is less than `k-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to have started.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute again, `k-1` must be greater than or equal to 2, which means `k` must be greater than 2.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is now `(4 * t) % MOD` % `MOD`, `tmp` is the current running sum that does not drop below zero, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (4 * t) % MOD` % `MOD + t` % `MOD`, `i` is 2**
