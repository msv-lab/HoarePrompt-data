The code reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into two parts using whitespace as the delimiter, and assigns these parts to the variables `n` and `k` after converting them to integers.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers.**
