Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the third element in the list `a`. If `tmp` is less than 0, `tmp` is set to 0 and `t` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum of `x` and 0. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged and `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of `x` and 0.***
