The value of `t` is updated to `t * 2`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is `(t * 2) % MOD`, the new value of `t` will be `((t * 2) * 2) % MOD`, which simplifies to `(t * 4) % MOD`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `t` is `(t * 4) % MOD`, `ans` is `(ans + t) % MOD`**
