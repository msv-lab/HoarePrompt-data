Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is `(t * 2) % MOD`, `ans` is `(ans + t) % MOD`**

Explanation: The line `ans %= MOD` does not change the value of `ans` because `ans` is already calculated as `(ans + t) % MOD`. Therefore, the value of `ans` remains `(ans + t) % MOD`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, and `t`) are not affected by this operation, so their values remain unchanged.
