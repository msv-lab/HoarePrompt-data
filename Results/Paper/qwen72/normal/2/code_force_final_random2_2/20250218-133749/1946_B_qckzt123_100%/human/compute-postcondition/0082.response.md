To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the formula used to compute `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is the maximum value of the cumulative sums of the subarrays of `a` that do not drop below zero, multiplied by \(2^{(k-1)}\) and taken modulo `MOD`.
- `tmp` is the last cumulative sum of the subarray being considered, which may be zero if it dropped below zero.
- `s`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is computed as `((s + t * (2^(k-1))) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.
- `i` is `k-2`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Understanding `t`:**
   - `t` is the result of a complex calculation involving the maximum cumulative sum of subarrays of `a` that do not drop below zero, scaled by \(2^{(k-1)}\), and then taken modulo `MOD`.

2. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - `ans` is computed using the formula: `((s + t * (2^(k-1))) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.
   - This formula ensures that the result is always non-negative and within the range `[0, MOD-1]`.

### Explanation of the Formula:
- `s` is a constant value from the initial state.
- `t` is the scaled and modulo-adjusted maximum cumulative sum.
- `2^(k-1)` is a power of 2, which is used to scale `t`.
- The expression `((s + t * (2^(k-1))) % MOD + MOD) % MOD` ensures that the result is within the range `[0, MOD-1]` even if the intermediate result is negative.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the formula, the `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans` as calculated by the formula provided. Since the exact values of `s`, `t`, and `MOD` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **ans (where ans is the value of ((s + t * (2^(k-1))) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, with s, t, and MOD as described in the initial state)**
