Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing `n+1` elements: `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and the last element is `a + k * c + d * h` where `k` is 1 and `h` is 0, `k` is 1, `h` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`.
- Since `k` is 1 and `h` is 0, the value appended is `a + 1 * c + d * 0`, which simplifies to `a + c`.
- The list `li` initially contains `n` elements, and now it contains `n + 1` elements.
- All other variables (`n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, `k`, `h`) remain unchanged.
