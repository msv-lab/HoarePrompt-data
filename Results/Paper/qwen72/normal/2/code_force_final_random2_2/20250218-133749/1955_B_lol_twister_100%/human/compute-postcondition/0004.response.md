Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing one element which is `a + k * c + d * h`, `k` is 0, `h` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`.
- Since `k` is 0 and `h` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a + 0 * c + 0 * d`, which is just `a`.
- Therefore, `li` now contains one element, which is the value of `a`.
- All other variables (`n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, `k`, `h`) remain unchanged.
