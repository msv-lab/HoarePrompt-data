The code snippet `li.append(a + k * c + d * h)` appends a new element to the list `li`. The new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`. Given that `h` is 0, the term `d * h` evaluates to 0, so the new element simplifies to `a + k * c`.

Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 and `h` is 0, these values remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `li` now includes the new element `a + k * c`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is 0, `li` contains the element `a + k * c`.**
