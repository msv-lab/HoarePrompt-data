Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` of `n^2` integers.

2. **Minimum Value Calculation**: The program finds the minimum value `a` in the list `l`. This is correct because the smallest element in the progressive square should be the starting point `a_{1,1}`.

3. **Progressive Square Construction**: The program constructs the list `li` by calculating the values `a + k * c + d * h` for all `k` and `h` in the range `[0, n-1]`. This correctly generates the elements of the progressive square based on the given rules.

4. **Sorting and Comparison**: Both `l` and `li` are sorted, and the program checks if they are equal. If they are equal, it means the elements in `l` can form the progressive square, and the program returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the constraints and edge cases correctly. It ensures that the lists are of the correct size and that the elements are within the specified ranges.

6. **Output Format**: The program outputs 'yes' or 'no' in lowercase, which is acceptable according to the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
