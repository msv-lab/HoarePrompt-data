Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing `n+2` elements: `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and the last two elements are `a + c + d` and `a + c + d`, `k` is 1, `h` is 1.** 

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `li` is a list containing `n+1` elements, where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and the last element is `a + c + d`.
- The code `li.append(a + k * c + d * h)` appends another element to `li` with the same value `a + c + d`.
- Therefore, `li` now contains `n+2` elements, with the last two elements both being `a + c + d`.
- All other variables (`n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, `k`, `h`) remain unchanged.
