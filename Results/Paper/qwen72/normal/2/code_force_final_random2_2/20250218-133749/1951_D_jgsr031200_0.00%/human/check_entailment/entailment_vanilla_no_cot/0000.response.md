Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as specified. Here are the issues:

1. The function `func_1` is called but is not properly integrated into the logic flow. It should handle the entire process of determining whether Bob can set up the stalls and prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. The logic within `func_1` is flawed. Specifically, the approach of using a fixed set of costs `[n - k + 1, 1]` and trying to distribute the purchases does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. The logic for calculating `h` and adjusting `n` is not aligned with the problem requirements.

3. The output format is incorrect. If the solution is possible, the program should print the number of stalls and their prices, but the current implementation does not always provide this information correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def solve(n, k):
    if n < k:
        print("NO")
        return
    
    # If k is 1, we can set up one stall with price n
    if k == 1:
        print("YES")
        print(1)
        print(n)
        return
    
    # Otherwise, we can set up k stalls with prices 1, 2, ..., k-1, and the remaining coins for the last stall
    prices = list(range(1, k))
    remaining_coins = n - sum(prices)
    
    if remaining_coins < 1:
        print("NO")
        return
    
    prices.append(remaining_coins)
    
    print("YES")
    print(k)
    print(" ".join(map(str, prices)))

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    solve(n, k)
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- If `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.
- If `k == 1`, it sets up one stall with the price equal to `n`.
- For other cases, it sets up `k` stalls with prices from 1 to `k-1` and the remaining coins for the last stall, ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
