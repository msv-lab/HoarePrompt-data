### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Equality (`n == k`)**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `n` equals `k`. It prints 'YES', followed by 1, and then 1. This is correct because if Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel.
   - This part of the code is correct.

2. **Check for Insufficient Coins (`n < k`)**:
   - The function correctly identifies and handles the case where `n` is less than `k`. It prints 'NO' because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels if she has fewer than `k` coins.
   - This part of the code is correct.

3. **Setting Up Stalls**:
   - The function sets up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - The first stall is priced at `n - k + 1` coins per jewel. This ensures that Alice can buy at most one jewel from this stall, leaving her with `n - (n - k + 1) = k - 1` coins.
   - The second stall is priced at 1 coin per jewel. Alice will use the remaining `k - 1` coins to buy `k - 1` more jewels, totaling `k` jewels.
   - This approach is correct and ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls (2) and the prices of the stalls.
   - This matches the required output format.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic when `h` is calculated and compared to `k`:
   - The variable `h` is used to accumulate the number of jewels Alice can buy from the stalls. However, the calculation of `h` is unnecessary because the prices are set in such a way that Alice will always buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - The condition `if h < k:` is redundant and can be removed. The function should directly print the prices of the stalls after ensuring that the prices are set correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. It ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up the appropriate number of stalls with the correct prices. The redundant check for `h` can be removed, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.
