The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is equal to `k`.

However, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`. It simply prints the constant integer `1`.

Output: **1**
