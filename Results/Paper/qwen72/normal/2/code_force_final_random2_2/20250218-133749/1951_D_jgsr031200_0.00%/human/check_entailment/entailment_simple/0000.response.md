Reasoning:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The program correctly checks if `n` equals `k`. If they are equal, it prints "YES" followed by 1 and 1, which is a valid solution because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin each.
   - If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program sets up a list `costs` with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then iterates over these costs, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy at each cost and updating `n` accordingly.
   - The variable `h` keeps track of the total number of jewels bought.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if `h` (the total number of jewels bought) is less than `k`. If it is, it prints "NO" because Alice did not buy enough jewels.
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints "YES" followed by 2 and the costs, indicating that Bob can set up 2 stalls with the specified prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is exactly `k` or when `n` is less than `k`.

5. **Logical Flow**:
   - The logical flow of the program is sound. It ensures that the conditions are checked in the correct order and that the output is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
