To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `n` is the remainder of `n` divided by `n - k + 1`.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is `n // (n - k + 1)`.
- `i` is `n - k + 1`.
- `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in costs:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements in the list `costs`.
- The list `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- The variable `i` takes the values from the list `costs` in each iteration.

### Current State:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - k + 1`.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must take the next value from the list `costs`.
- The next value in the list `costs` is `1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` should be set to `1`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is the remainder of `n` divided by `n - k + 1`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // (n - k + 1)`, `i` is `1`, `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`**
