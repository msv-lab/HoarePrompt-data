Output State: **`n` is the remainder of `n` divided by `n - k + 1`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n`, `i` is `1`, `curr` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `h` is updated to `h + curr`.
- Initially, `h` was `n // (n - k + 1)`.
- `curr` is `n`.
- Therefore, `h` is now `n // (n - k + 1) + n`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
