The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and `n` is equal to `k`. The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`, it will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
