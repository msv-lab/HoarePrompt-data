Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is 0.** 

The variable `h` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`n`, `k`, and `costs`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
