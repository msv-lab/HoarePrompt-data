Output State: **`n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n`, `i` is `n - k + 1`, `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `curr` is updated to `n // i`.
- Given `i` is `n - k + 1`, `curr` becomes `n // (n - k + 1)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
