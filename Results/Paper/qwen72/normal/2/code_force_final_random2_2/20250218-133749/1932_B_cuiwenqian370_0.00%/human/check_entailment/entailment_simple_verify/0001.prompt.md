You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the year when the nth sign will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur sequentially. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a list of periodicities for the signs.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function is designed to handle a different problem, specifically one involving a path with characters `@` and `*`. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of `@` characters that can be collected while avoiding `*` characters.
     - The function does not match the requirements of the given problem. It does not handle periodic occurrences of signs or sequential waiting times.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
     - Since `func_1` is not designed to solve the given problem, the entire program will not produce the correct output for the specified problem.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The functions are designed for a different problem and do not implement the logic required to find the year when the nth sign will occur based on the given periodicities.

Correctness: **False**
