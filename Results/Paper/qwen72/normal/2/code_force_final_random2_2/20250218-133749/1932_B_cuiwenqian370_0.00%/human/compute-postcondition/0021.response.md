Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its current value, `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`, `data` is a list of strings, `path` is the string at `data[4]`, `index` is 6, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)` twice.**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing from 5 to 6.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `data`, `path`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
