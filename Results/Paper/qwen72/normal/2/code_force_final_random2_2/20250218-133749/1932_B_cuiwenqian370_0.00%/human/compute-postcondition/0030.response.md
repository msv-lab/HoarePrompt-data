The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If there are more items in `results`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least two results of `func_1(path)`, and `result` is the second result in the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least three items, and `result` will be the third item in the `results` list.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last `n` processed, `data` is a list of strings, `path` is the string at the last `path` processed, `index` is the final index after processing all elements, `results` is a list containing at least three results of `func_1(path)`, `result` is the third result in the `results` list**
