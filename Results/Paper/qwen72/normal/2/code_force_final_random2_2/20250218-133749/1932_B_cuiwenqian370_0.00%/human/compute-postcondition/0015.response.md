Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `path` is the string at `data[2]`, `index` is 4, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `data`, `path`, `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
