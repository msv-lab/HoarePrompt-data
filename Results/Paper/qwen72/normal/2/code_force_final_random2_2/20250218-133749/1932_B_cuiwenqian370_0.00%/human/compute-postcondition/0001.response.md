Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of signs. data is a list of strings, where each element is a space-separated integer read from the input. path is a string containing space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs.**
