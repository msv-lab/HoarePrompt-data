Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the problem described. The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur, considering the periodicity and sequential nature of the signs. However, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to solve a path traversal problem involving characters (`@` and `*`), which is entirely unrelated to the given problem. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect for the specified problem.

Final: **False**
