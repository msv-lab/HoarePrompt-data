The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends solely on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its current value, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `path` is the string at `data[4]`, `index` is 5, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)` twice**
