The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` updates the value of `n` based on the element at index 1 in the list `data`. Given that `index` is 1, `n` will be set to the integer value of `data[1]`.

Since `data` is a list of strings, `data[1]` is a string that represents an integer. After converting this string to an integer, `n` will hold this integer value.

The other variables (`t`, `data`, `path`, `index`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings, `path` is a string containing space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**
