Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the problem described. The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur, considering the sequential nature of the signs and their periodicities. However, `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to solve a different problem involving path traversal with specific characters (`@` and `*`). The logic and structure of these functions do not align with the requirements of the given problem. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect for the specified problem.

Final: **False**
