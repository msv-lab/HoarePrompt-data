Correctness: **False**

The provided functions do not match the problem description. The problem requires calculating the year when the n-th sign will occur, considering the periodicity of each sign and the sequential nature of their occurrences. However, the provided functions seem to be dealing with a different problem, possibly related to a path with special characters ('@', '*'), which is not relevant to the apocalypse signs problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect for the specified problem.
