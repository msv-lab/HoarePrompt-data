The function `func_1` takes a list `path` as input, where each element of the list is a string that can be either '@', '*', or a digit. The function processes this list to compute a dynamic programming array `dp` that tracks the maximum number of '@' symbols encountered up to each position in the list, while avoiding positions marked with '*'. The function returns the maximum value from the `dp` array, excluding any `-inf` values, which represent positions that cannot be reached due to encountering '*'. If the input list `path` is empty, the function returns 0.
