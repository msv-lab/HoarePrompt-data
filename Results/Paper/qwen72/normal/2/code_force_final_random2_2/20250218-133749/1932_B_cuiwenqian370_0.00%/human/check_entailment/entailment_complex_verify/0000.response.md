Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not solve the problem described in the problem statement. The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur, considering the sequential nature of the signs and their periodicities. However, the provided functions are designed to solve a different problem involving path traversal with specific characters (`@` and `*`). The function `func_1` processes a list of characters and computes a dynamic programming array based on these characters, which is not relevant to the problem of determining the year of the n-th sign based on periodicities. Similarly, `func_2` reads input and processes it using `func_1`, but it does not handle the periodicity of signs or the sequential waiting period as required by the problem. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect for the given problem description.

Final: **False**
