Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Dictionary Initialization**: The program initializes a dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). However, there is an issue in the initialization. The `defaultdict` is initialized with a function `default_value`, which is not defined. Instead, the program manually sets the initial values of the dictionary keys to 0, which is redundant and can be simplified using `defaultdict(int)`.

3. **Counting Occurrences**: The program correctly iterates over the string `s` and updates the counts of each difficulty level in the dictionary `d`.

4. **Calculating Required Problems**: The program calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level by checking if the current count of each difficulty level is less than or equal to `m`. If so, it adds the difference (`m - d[val]`) to the answer `ans`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

6. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined but never used, which is unnecessary and can be removed.

Despite the minor issues with the dictionary initialization and the unused function, the core logic of the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
