Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the given string and then calculating how many additional problems are needed to ensure that there are at least `m` problems of each difficulty level. The logic for counting the occurrences and calculating the required additional problems seems correct. However, there is an issue with the initialization of the `defaultdict`. The `defaultdict` should be initialized with a function that returns the default value, but the code incorrectly uses `default_value`, which is not defined. Instead, it should use `int` or `lambda: 0` to provide a default value of 0.

Additionally, the `func_1` function is defined but never used in the program, making it redundant. This does not affect the correctness of the program, but it is unnecessary.

Given the above points, the program would work correctly if the `defaultdict` is properly initialized. Since the current implementation uses an undefined `default_value`, the program will raise an error when executed.

Correctness: **False**
