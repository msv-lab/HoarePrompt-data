Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` and `x` are not updated, `y` is not updated, `i` is `y + 1`, and the current value of `y` is less than `x`. If `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]`, then `t` is updated to `x - (y + 1) + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `t`.***
