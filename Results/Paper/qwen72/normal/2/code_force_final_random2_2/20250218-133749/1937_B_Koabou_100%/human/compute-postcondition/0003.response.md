The code snippet `a.append(input())` is executed twice, which means two inputs will be taken and appended to the list `a`. Since the initial state specifies that `a` is an empty list, after executing the code, `a` will contain two elements, each being the result of an `input()` call.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, the loop will execute 2 times.**
