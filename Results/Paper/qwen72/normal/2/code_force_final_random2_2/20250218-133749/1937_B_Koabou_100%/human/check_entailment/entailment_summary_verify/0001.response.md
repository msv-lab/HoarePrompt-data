### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid dimensions and the two rows of the grid.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` to store the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It also initializes variables `x` and `y` to track the positions where the path changes from the top row to the bottom row.
   - The program iterates through the grid columns to determine the optimal path:
     - If the next cell in the top row is '0' and the current cell in the bottom row is '1', it updates `y` to the current index.
     - If the next cell in the top row is '1' and the current cell in the bottom row is '0', it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the top row up to the current index and the bottom row from the current index onwards, and sets `x` to the current index. This ensures that the path takes the lexicographically smallest string.
     - If no such change is found, it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the entire top row and the last cell of the bottom row.

3. **Counting Paths**:
   - The program initializes a variable `t` to 1, which will count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It then iterates from `y` to `x` to check if there are multiple paths that yield the same string. Specifically, it checks if the substring of the bottom row from `y` to `x` matches the corresponding substring of the constructed string `s`. If it does, it updates `t` to the number of possible paths from `y` to `x`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `s`.
   - It prints the number of paths `t` that yield this string.

### Analysis:
- **Path Construction**:
  - The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string is correct. The program correctly identifies the point where it should switch from the top row to the bottom row to minimize the string lexicographically.
- **Counting Paths**:
  - The logic for counting the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string is flawed. The program should count all possible paths that yield the same string, but the current implementation only checks a specific condition and updates `t` accordingly. This might not cover all possible paths.

### Specific Issues:
- **Output Formatting**:
  - The use of `print(s, sep='')` is unnecessary because `s` is already a string. Simply `print(s)` would suffice.
- **Path Counting Logic**:
  - The current logic for counting paths is too simplistic and may not correctly handle all cases. For example, it should consider all possible paths from the start to the end that yield the same lexicographically smallest string.

### Corrected Path Counting Logic:
- To correctly count the number of paths, the program should:
  - Initialize a counter `count` to 1.
  - Iterate through the grid and count the number of ways to reach each cell while maintaining the lexicographically smallest string.
  - Use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of paths that yield the smallest string.

### Conclusion:
- The core logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string is correct.
- However, the logic for counting the number of paths that yield this string is incorrect and needs to be revised.

Final: **False**
