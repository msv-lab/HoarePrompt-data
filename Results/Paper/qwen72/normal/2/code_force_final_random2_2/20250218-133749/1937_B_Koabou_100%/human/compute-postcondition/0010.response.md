Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is an empty list, `x` is 0.** 

The variable `x` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
