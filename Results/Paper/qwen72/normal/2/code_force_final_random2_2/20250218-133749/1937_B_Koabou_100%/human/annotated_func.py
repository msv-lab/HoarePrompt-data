#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and a_{11}a_{12}...a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}...a_{2n} are binary strings of length n, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings.
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings. If the loop finds a position `i` where `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', then `s` is the concatenation of the first `i + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from the `i`-th character, and `x` is set to `i`. If no such position is found, `s` is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`, and `x` is set to `n - 1`. The value of `y` is the largest index `i` where `a[0][i + 1]` is '0' and `a[1][i]` is '1', or 0 if no such index exists.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: `t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` and `x` are not updated, `y` is not updated, and the loop has completed all iterations from `y` to `x - 1`. If at any point during the loop, the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]` was true, then `t` is updated to `x - i + 1` where `i` is the index at which the condition was met, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `t` remains 1.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is the original string `s`)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: t (where t is 1 if the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]` was never true, or `x - i + 1` if the condition was true at some index `i`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input for multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it processes the strings to find a specific pattern and outputs a modified string `s` and an integer `t`. The modified string `s` is constructed based on the positions where certain conditions are met in the input strings. The integer `t` represents the length of a matching substring found during the processing, or 1 if no such match is found. After processing all test cases, the function prints the results for each case.
