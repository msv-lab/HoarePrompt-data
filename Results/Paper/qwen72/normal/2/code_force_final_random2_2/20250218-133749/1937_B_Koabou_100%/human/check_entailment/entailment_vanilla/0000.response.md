### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them using a loop. For each test case, it reads the grid dimensions and the two rows of the grid.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` to store the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It also initializes variables `x` and `y` to track the positions where the path changes from the top row to the bottom row.
   - The program iterates through the grid columns to determine the optimal path:
     - If the next cell in the top row is '0' and the current cell in the bottom row is '1', it updates `y` to the current index.
     - If the next cell in the top row is '1' and the current cell in the bottom row is '0', it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the top row up to the current index and the bottom row from the current index onwards, and sets `x` to the current index. This ensures that the path takes the lexicographically smallest string.
     - If no such change is found, it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the entire top row and the last cell of the bottom row.

3. **Counting Paths**:
   - The program initializes a variable `t` to 1, which will count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It then iterates from `y` to `x` to check if there are multiple paths that yield the same string. Specifically, it checks if the substring of the bottom row from `y` to `x` matches the corresponding substring of the constructed string `s`. If it does, it updates `t` to the number of possible paths from `y` to `x`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `s`.
   - It prints the number of paths `t` that yield this string.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the lexicographically smallest string by comparing the top and bottom rows and switching to the bottom row when necessary.
- The counting of paths is also handled correctly by checking for matching substrings.

However, there are a few potential issues:
- The use of `print(s, sep='')` is unnecessary because `s` is already a string. Simply `print(s)` would suffice.
- The logic for counting paths might be overly complex. The program should ensure that it correctly counts all possible paths that yield the same string.

### Conclusion:
Despite minor issues in the output formatting and potentially complex path counting, the core logic of the program appears to be correct and should handle the given problem effectively.

Correctness: **True**
