The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `n - 1`, so we can only adjust these.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5. The loop condition is `i < n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n - 1` must still be greater than `i`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is an empty list if the second character of the first string in `a` is not '1' or the first character of the second string in `a` is not '0'. If the second character of the first string in `a` is '1' and the first character of the second string in `a` is '0', then `s` is the first character of `a[0]` followed by the entire string `a[1]`, and `y` is set to 1. `x` is 0, `y` is 0 or 1, and `i` is 2.**
