The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to indicate that the value from `range(2)` is not needed within the loop body. The loop will execute a fixed number of times (2 times) regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has already executed once. For the loop to execute one more time, the loop counter (which is implicitly managed by the `for` loop) needs to increment by 1.

Since the loop is set to execute 2 times, and it has already executed once, the loop will execute one more time without any changes to the state of `t`, `n`, or `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, the loop will execute 2 times.**
