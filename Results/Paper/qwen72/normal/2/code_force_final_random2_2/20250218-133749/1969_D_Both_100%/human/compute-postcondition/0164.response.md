Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` contains the last `k` tuples from `combined` (sorted by the bonus values in ascending order), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the `prices` list, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, and `combined` must not be empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `k` is 0, `item` is the last tuple removed from `combined`. Additionally, the sum of the first element and the second element of `item` is less than 0, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit + item[0]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the `current_profit` by adding the first element of the `item` tuple to it. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The specific value of `item[0]` is not provided, but it is known that the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is less than 0. Therefore, `current_profit` is now equal to its previous value plus `item[0]`.
