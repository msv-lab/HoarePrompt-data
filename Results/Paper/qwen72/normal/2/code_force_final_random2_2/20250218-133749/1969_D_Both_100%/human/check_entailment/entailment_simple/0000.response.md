Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly handle the input for the number of test cases and the details of each test case, respectively. They ensure that the input is read and processed correctly.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - The prices for Alice are negated (`neg_prices`) to facilitate the use of a min-heap (since Python's `heapq` module only provides a min-heap).
   - The `combined` list is created by zipping `neg_prices` and `bonuses` and then sorting it based on the bonuses (Bob's prices). This ensures that the items with the highest bonuses are considered first.

3. **Heap Operations**:
   - The first `k` items are pushed into the heap. This simulates Bob taking the `k` most expensive items (in terms of Bob's prices) for free.
   - The remaining items are stored in the `combined` list.

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The function `func_3` calculates the total profit by summing up the profits of the items in the `secondary_heap` and adding the profits of the items in `primary_items` where the sum of Alice's and Bob's prices is non-negative.
   - The main loop in `func_4` iterates through the remaining items, updating the current profit and the heap. It ensures that the current profit is maximized by considering the best possible combination of items.

5. **Optimality**:
   - The algorithm correctly handles the constraints and ensures that both Alice and Bob act optimally. Alice tries to maximize her profit, and Bob tries to minimize it by taking the most valuable items for free.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as when `k` is 0 or when there are no items left to process.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
