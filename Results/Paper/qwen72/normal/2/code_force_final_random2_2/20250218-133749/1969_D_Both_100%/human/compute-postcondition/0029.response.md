The only variable in the loop head is `combined`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `combined`. If `combined` is not empty, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `combined` is described as a sorted list of tuples, but it is not explicitly stated whether it is non-empty. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `combined` must be non-empty.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a non-empty sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element (bonuses) in ascending order. If `combined` is not empty, `current_profit` is set to `func_3_result` and `combined` is missing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values. If `combined` is empty, `current_profit` remains 0. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**
