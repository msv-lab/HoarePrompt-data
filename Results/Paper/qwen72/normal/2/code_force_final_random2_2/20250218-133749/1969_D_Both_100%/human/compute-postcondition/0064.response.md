To determine what will be printed by the `print(max_profit)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `heap` is a list containing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values from `combined`.
   - `remaining_items` is an empty list.
   - `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`.
   - `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`.
   - `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `combined` is an empty list.
   - `current_profit` is the final profit after processing all items.
   - `max_profit` is the maximum profit observed during the loop execution.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `max_profit` is the key variable here. It is described as the maximum profit observed during the loop execution. This implies that `max_profit` is updated multiple times during the loop, and the final value of `max_profit` is the highest profit encountered.

3. **Execution Context:**
   - The `print(max_profit)` statement will output the value of `max_profit` after all the processing is done. Since `max_profit` is the maximum profit observed, it will be the highest profit value that was recorded during the loop.

Given this information, the output of the `print(max_profit)` statement will be the maximum profit observed during the loop execution. Since the exact values of `prices`, `bonuses`, and the processing logic are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `max_profit`. However, we can describe it in terms of the given context.

Output: **max_profit (where max_profit is the maximum profit observed during the loop execution)**
