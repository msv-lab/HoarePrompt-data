The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the value `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `combined` (a tuple consisting of a negated price and a corresponding bonus), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses` (sorted by the bonus) but may be missing its last element if `combined` was not empty, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, and `k` must be greater than 1**
