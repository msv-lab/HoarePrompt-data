Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final profit after processing all items, `max_profit` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `max_profit` to 0.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `combined`, `current_profit`) remain unchanged.
- The initial conditions for these variables are still valid.
