Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a non-empty sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element (bonuses) in ascending order, but now missing one more tuple, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `combined`, `combined` is missing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values plus the last two removed tuples, `removed_item` is the tuple that was pushed into `heap` and then popped out. If `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - item[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `current_profit -= item[1]` updates the value of `current_profit` by subtracting the second element of the tuple `item` from `current_profit`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The new value of `current_profit` is `current_profit - item[1]`.
