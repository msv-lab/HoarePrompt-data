### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with `n` items, each having different prices for Alice (`a_i`) and Bob (`b_i`).
   - Alice wants to maximize her profit, which is calculated as the difference between what Bob pays her and what she pays for the items.
   - Bob can take up to `k` items for free if Alice buys at least `k` items, and he will choose the items that minimize Alice's profit.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads input using custom functions `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - It processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes a heap and a list of remaining items.
   - It sorts the items based on Bob's prices and pushes the first `k` items into the heap.
   - It calculates the initial profit and then iterates through the remaining items, updating the profit and the heap as necessary.
   - The final maximum profit is printed for each test case.

3. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Reading Input**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used to read the number of test cases and the input values for each test case.
   - **Heap Initialization**: A heap is used to keep track of the `k` items that Bob will take for free. This ensures that Bob always takes the items that minimize Alice's profit.
   - **Profit Calculation**:
     - The function `func_3` calculates the total profit for a given set of primary and secondary items.
     - The main loop in `func_4` processes each test case, sorting the items and pushing the first `k` items into the heap.
     - It then iterates through the remaining items, updating the current profit and the heap to ensure Bob's optimal choice.
   - **Output**: The maximum profit is printed for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 0 or when there are fewer than `k` items.
   - The use of a heap ensures that Bob always takes the items that minimize Alice's profit, which is crucial for the correctness of the solution.

5. **Optimality**:
   - The program uses a greedy approach combined with a heap to ensure that both Alice and Bob act optimally.
   - The sorting and heap operations are efficient, making the solution suitable for large inputs as specified in the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the algorithm ensures that both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Correctness: **True**
