### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_2` reads the space-separated integers for the number of items and the value of `k`, as well as the prices and bonuses for the items.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - `func_4` processes each test case by reading the necessary inputs and initializing the required data structures.
   - It creates a list of tuples `combined` where each tuple contains the negative price (for Alice) and the bonus (for Bob).
   - The list `combined` is sorted based on the bonus values to ensure optimal selection of items.

3. **Heap Operations**:
   - A heap is used to keep track of the `k` most profitable items for Bob.
   - The function `func_3` is called to calculate the total profit for the current state of `heap` and `combined`.

4. **Dynamic Profit Calculation**:
   - The function iterates through the remaining items in `combined` and updates the current profit by considering the impact of adding or removing items from the heap.
   - The maximum profit is updated whenever a new maximum is found.

5. **Output**:
   - The maximum profit for each test case is printed.

### Analysis:
- The logic for handling the input and processing each test case is consistent with the problem statement.
- The use of a heap ensures that the `k` most profitable items for Bob are selected, which aligns with the problem's constraints.
- The dynamic profit calculation correctly accounts for the changes in profit when items are added or removed from the heap.
- The final output matches the expected results based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
