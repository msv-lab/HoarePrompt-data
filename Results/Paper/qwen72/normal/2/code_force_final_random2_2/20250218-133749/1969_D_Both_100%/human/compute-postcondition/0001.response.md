The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly set.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
