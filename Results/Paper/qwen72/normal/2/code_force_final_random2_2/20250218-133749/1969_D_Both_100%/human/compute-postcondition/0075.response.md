The code snippet `combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])` sorts the list `combined` based on the second element of each tuple (i.e., the bonuses). This operation does not change the values of the elements in `combined`, only their order.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` must be greater than 1
- `heap` is an empty list
- `remaining_items` is an empty list
- `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`
- `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`
- `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`
- `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`
- `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses`
- `current_profit` is 0
- `max_profit` is 0

After executing the code snippet, the list `combined` is sorted based on the second element of each tuple (i.e., the bonuses).

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses` (sorted by the bonus), `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0.**
