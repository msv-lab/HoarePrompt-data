To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `palka`.

1. **`i`**: This variable will take the value of each element in `palka` during each iteration of the loop.
2. **`palka`**: This is the list over which the loop iterates. For the loop to execute, `palka` must contain at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `palka` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `d` is an empty dictionary.
- `pl` is an empty list.
- `shapes` is 0.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.
- `w` must be greater than the new value of `_`.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `ln` is an input integer.

For the loop to execute, `palka` must have at least one element. The other variables and conditions do not directly affect the loop's ability to start.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `palka` has at least one element and `i` is set to the first element of `palka`.

State: **`palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `palka`, `d` is an empty dictionary, `pl` is an empty list, `shapes` is 0, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `w` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `_` is incremented by 1, `ln` is an input integer.**
