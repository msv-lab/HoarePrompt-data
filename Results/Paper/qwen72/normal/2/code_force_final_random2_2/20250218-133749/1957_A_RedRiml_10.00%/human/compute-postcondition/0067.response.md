Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `d` will contain each unique element from `palka` as keys with their corresponding counts as values. The list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared. The variable `shapes` will be the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The dictionary `d` will map each unique element from the list `palka` to the number of times it appears in `palka`.
- The list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered during the loop's execution.
- The variable `shapes` will count how many unique elements in `pl` (which are the unique elements from `palka`) appear at least 3 times in `palka`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
