Output State: **`palka` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `palka`, `d` contains the key-value pair `{i: 1}` or `d[i]` is increased by 1, `i` is now in the list `pl`.** 

Explanation: The value of `i` (which is the first element in `palka`) is appended to the list `pl`. The dictionary `d` either contains the key-value pair `{i: 1}` if `d.get(i)` was `None`, or `d[i]` is incremented by 1 if `d.get(i)` was not `None`. The condition that `i` is not in the list `pl` is no longer true because `i` has been added to `pl`. All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
