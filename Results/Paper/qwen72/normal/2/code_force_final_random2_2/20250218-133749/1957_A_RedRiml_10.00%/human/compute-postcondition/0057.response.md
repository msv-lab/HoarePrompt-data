The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is the second element in the list `palka`, and if `i` is not already in the list `pl`, then `d` contains the key-value pair `{i: 1}` or `d[i]` is increased by 1, and `i` is added to the list `pl`. If `i` is already in the list `pl`, the state remains unchanged.

Since the code `d[i] += 1` is executed, it implies that `i` is already a key in the dictionary `d` and its value is being incremented by 1. This means `i` must have been added to `pl` previously, and `d` already contains the key `i`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`palka` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `palka`, `i` is in the list `pl`, `d` contains the key `i` with its value increased by 1.**
