Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `w` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` representing the number of sticks and a list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks. It then calculates and prints the number of unique stick lengths that appear 3 or more times in the list for each test case. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. After the function completes, the input variables `w`, `ln`, and the list of stick lengths remain unchanged, while the internal variables used for processing (such as `d`, `pl`, and `shapes`) will reflect the state of the last test case processed. **
