Postcondition: ***`d` contains each unique element from `palka` as keys with their corresponding counts as values, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 2 elements, `j` is the second element in `pl`. If the count of the element `j` in the dictionary `d` is less than 3, `shapes` is 0. Otherwise, `shapes` is 2. The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln` remain unchanged.***
