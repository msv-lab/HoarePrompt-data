Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value of 1, `pl` is a list that now contains the third element of `palka` if it was not already present, `shapes` is 0, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `w` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `_` is incremented by 1, `ln` is an input integer, and `i` is in `pl` if it was not already present.**

Explanation:
- The code `d[i] = 1` sets the value of the key `i` in the dictionary `d` to 1.
- The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
