Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `shapes` is 0, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `w` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `palka`, `ln` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least one element, `shapes` is 1 if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `shapes` remains 0, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `w` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `palka`, and `ln` is an input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least two elements, `j` is the second element in `pl`, `shapes` is 1 if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `shapes` remains 0, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `w` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `palka`, and `ln` is an input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least three elements, `j` is the third element in `pl`, `shapes` is 2 if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `shapes` remains 0, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `w` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `palka`, and `ln` is an input integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
