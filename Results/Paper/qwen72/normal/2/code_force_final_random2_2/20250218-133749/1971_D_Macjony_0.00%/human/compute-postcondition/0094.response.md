Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input string with a length greater than 3, `j` is 2 or 3 (depending on whether the condition `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'` was true initially), `count` is 2 or 3 (depending on whether the first character of `s` is not equal to the second character of `s`), and `flag` is True if `s[j-1] == '0' and s[j] == '1'`, otherwise `flag` remains False.**
