Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string with a length greater than 4, `count` is 2 if the first character of `s` is equal to the second character of `s`, otherwise `count` is 3, if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, `count` is 4 and `j` is 2 if the first character of `s` is '0' and the second character of `s` is '1' and `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', otherwise `j` is 1, after the code execution, `j` is 3 or 4 if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', otherwise `j` is 2 or 3, `flag` is True if the first character of `s` is '0' and the second character of `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False.***
