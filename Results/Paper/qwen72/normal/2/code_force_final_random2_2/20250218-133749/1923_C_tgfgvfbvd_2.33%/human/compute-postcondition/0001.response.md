The code snippet takes an input from the user, which is expected to contain two integers separated by a space. These integers are then split and converted to integers, assigning the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `m`. The initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be a positive integer within a certain range, but since the input is now split into two values, this condition applies to both `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4)**
