Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is the last element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input. If `a` is at least 2, `s` is updated to `s - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged. Additionally, `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`.**
