The value of `c` is incremented by `x`. However, the value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `c`. The other variables (`_`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is an empty list, `c` is now `c + x`**.
