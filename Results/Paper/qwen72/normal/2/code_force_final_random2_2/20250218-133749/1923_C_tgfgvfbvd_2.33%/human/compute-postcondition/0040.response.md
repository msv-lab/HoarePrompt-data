To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^4\).
   - `l` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
   - `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, then `s` is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to the `(b-1)`-th index minus `p[a - 2]`.
   - Otherwise, `s` is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to the `(b-1)`-th index, which is equal to `p[b - 1]`.
   - If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met.
   - Otherwise, the condition is not met.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains the line `print('NO')`.

Given the conditions and the print statement, we need to determine if the condition is met or not. If the condition is not met, the print statement will execute and print 'NO'.

Let's analyze the condition:
- The condition is not met if either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s < 2 * (b - a + 1)`.

Since the print statement is `print('NO')`, it implies that the condition is not met. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
