The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to iterate over the range specified by `int(input())`. Since the loop is iterating over a fixed range, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `_`.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` would have reached the maximum value of the range minus one (since Python's `range` function is zero-indexed). For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, but this increment is handled automatically by the `for` loop itself.

Given that the loop has already completed all iterations (`m` is 0, indicating all iterations have been completed), the loop will not execute again unless a new input is provided to reset the range.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted further for the loop to execute again, as it is controlled by the input provided to the `range` function.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is 0 (all iterations have been completed)**.
