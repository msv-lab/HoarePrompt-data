Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 3 elements, `p` is a list containing the values `c + x` and `c`, `c` is now `c + x`, `x` is the third element in the list `l`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is updated to `c + x`.
- The list `p` contains the values `c + x` and `c` before the update.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `x`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `c` is `c + x`, where `x` is the third element in the list `l`.
