Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down the scenario step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4).
- `l` is a list of integers read from input.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input.
- If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to the `(b-1)`-th index minus `p[a - 2]`.
- Otherwise, `s` is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to the `(b-1)`-th index.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `s` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables and objects described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
