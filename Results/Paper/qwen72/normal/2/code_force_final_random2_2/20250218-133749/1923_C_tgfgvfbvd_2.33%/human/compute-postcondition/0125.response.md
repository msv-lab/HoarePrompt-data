Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last element in `l`, `m` is now `m - 1`, and `s` is now `p[b - 1]`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Additionally, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the specific condition within the if part is met. Otherwise, the condition within the else part is met. `m` must be greater than 0.***
