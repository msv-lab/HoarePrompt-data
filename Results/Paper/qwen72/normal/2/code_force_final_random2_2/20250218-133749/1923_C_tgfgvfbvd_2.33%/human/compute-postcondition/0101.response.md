Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is 0, `x` is the last element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input.**

Explanation:
- `n` and `m` remain as they were initially set by the user input.
- `l` remains the same list of integers read from input.
- `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point. For example, if `l = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, then `p` will be `[1, 3, 6, 10]`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`. For example, if `l = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, then `c` will be `10`.
- `m` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `x` is the last element in `l` because the loop iterates over all elements in `l`, and the last value assigned to `x` is the last element in `l`.
- `a` and `b` remain as they were initially set by the user input.
