Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is 0, `x` is the last element in `l`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`l`**: This is the original list of integers read from input, which remains unchanged.
- **`p`**: After the loop completes, `p` contains the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`. For example, if `l = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, then `p` will be `[1, 3, 6, 10]`.
- **`c`**: This variable holds the sum of all elements in `l` after the loop completes.
- **`m`**: This remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`x`**: This is the last element in `l` because the loop iterates over each element in `l`, and the last iteration sets `x` to the last element of `l`.
