You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = []
        c = 0
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each test case, it reads the list of integers and computes a prefix sum array. For each query, it checks if the sum of a specified subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the results of all queries.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of the array `l` and stores them in the list `p`. This allows for efficient computation of the sum of any subarray.
   - The prefix sum `p[i]` represents the sum of the first `i+1` elements of the array `l`.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program extracts the subarray sum using the prefix sums.
   - The subarray sum `s` for the range `[a, b]` is calculated as `p[b-1] - p[a-2]` if `a > 1`, otherwise it is simply `p[b-1]`.

3. **Conditions for a Good Subarray**:
   - The subarray is considered good if:
     - The length of the subarray is greater than 1 (`b - a + 1 > 1`).
     - The sum of the subarray `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray (`s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where the subarray length is 1, which is not good by definition.
   - It also ensures that the sum of the subarray is sufficient to form a valid `b` array where each element is positive and different from the corresponding element in the subarray.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of prefix sums ensures that each query is processed in constant time, making the solution efficient for large inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
