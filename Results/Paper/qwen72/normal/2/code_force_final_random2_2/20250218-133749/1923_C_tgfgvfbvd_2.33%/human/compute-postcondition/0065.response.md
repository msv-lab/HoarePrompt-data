To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4).
   - `l` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point.
   - `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `m` is greater than 0.
   - `x` is the last element in `l`.
   - `a` and `b` are integers read from input.
   - If `a` is at least 2, `s` is updated to `s - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.
   - `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` implies that the range `[a, b]` contains at least two elements.
   - The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` ensures that `s` is at least twice the length of the range `[a, b]`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement will always print the string `'YES'`.

Given the conditions and the initial state, the `print('YES')` statement will execute and print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
