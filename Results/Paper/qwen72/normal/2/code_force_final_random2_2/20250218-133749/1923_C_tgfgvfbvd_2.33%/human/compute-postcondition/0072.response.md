The code `s -= p[a - 2]` updates the value of `s` by subtracting the value at index `a - 2` in the list `p` from the current value of `s`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `s` is updated to `s - p[a - 2]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `x`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `x` is the last element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1` minus the value at index `a - 2` in `p`.**
