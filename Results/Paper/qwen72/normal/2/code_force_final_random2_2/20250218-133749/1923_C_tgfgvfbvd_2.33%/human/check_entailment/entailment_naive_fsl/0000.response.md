Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the sum of the subarray and checks the conditions for the subarray to be "good." Specifically, the issue lies in the way the prefix sums are used and the condition checking.

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation and Subarray Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sum `p` is calculated correctly, but when calculating the sum of the subarray from `a` to `b`, the program uses `p[b - 1]` and subtracts `p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`. This is incorrect because it should subtract `p[a - 1]` instead of `p[a - 2]` to get the correct subarray sum.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The condition `if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):` is used to check if the subarray is "good". However, this condition is not sufficient to ensure that there exists a valid array `b` such that all elements are positive, different from `a`, and the sums are equal.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3
```

- For the query `(1, 5)`, the subarray is `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]`.
  - The sum of the subarray is `13`.
  - The program calculates the sum correctly but incorrectly checks the condition.
  - The correct condition should be that the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray plus the number of distinct elements in the subarray.

- For the query `(4, 4)`, the subarray is `[4]`.
  - The sum of the subarray is `4`.
  - The program incorrectly prints `NO` because it does not handle the case where the subarray has only one element.

- For the query `(3, 4)`, the subarray is `[1, 4]`.
  - The sum of the subarray is `5`.
  - The program correctly prints `YES` because the sum is `5` and the length is `2`.

- For the query `(1, 3)`, the subarray is `[1, 2, 1]`.
  - The sum of the subarray is `4`.
  - The program correctly prints `NO` because the sum is `4` and the length is `3`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly handle the condition for a subarray to be "good" and has issues with the prefix sum calculation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
