Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is an empty list, `c` is the first element in `l`, `m` is 0, `x` is the first element in `l`.**

Explanation: The code `c += x` increments the value of `c` by the value of `x`. Since `x` is the first element in the list `l`, `c` now holds the value of the first element in `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
