Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `m` are updated to values provided by user input.
- `l` is a list of integers read from input.
- `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `x` is the last element in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from user input.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1`.
- If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is updated to `s - p[a - 2]`.
- Additionally, either \( b - a + 1 \leq 1 \) or \( s < 2 \times (b - a + 1) \).

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
