The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `l`. This operation updates the value of `l` but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is 0 (all iterations have been completed).**
