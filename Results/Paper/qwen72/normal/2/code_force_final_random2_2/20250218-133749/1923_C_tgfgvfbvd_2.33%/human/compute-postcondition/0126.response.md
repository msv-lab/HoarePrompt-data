To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **User Inputs:**
   - `a` and `b` are updated to values provided by the user.
   - `n` and `m` are updated to values provided by the user.
   - `l` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point.
   - `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `x` is the last element in `l`.

2. **Updates and Conditions:**
   - `m` is updated to `m - 1`.
   - `s` is initially set to `p[b - 1]`.
   - If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
   - If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, a specific condition is met.
   - Otherwise, another condition is met.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will always print 'YES' because the conditions described do not affect the content of the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement simply prints the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions met.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **YES**
