### Reasoning:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the prefix sums of the array `l` and stores them in the list `p`. This allows for efficient computation of the sum of any subarray using the formula `p[b-1] - p[a-2]`.

2. **Subarray Sum Calculation**:
   - For each query, the program correctly computes the sum of the subarray `c[a-1]` to `c[b-1]` using the prefix sums. The condition `if a - 2 >= 0:` ensures that the prefix sum subtraction is only performed if the starting index `a` is greater than 1.

3. **Good Subarray Condition**:
   - The program checks if the subarray is "good" by verifying two conditions:
     - The length of the subarray is greater than 1 (`b - a + 1 > 1`).
     - The sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray (`s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`).
   - These conditions are derived from the problem statement:
     - The sum of the subarray must equal the sum of another array `b` where all elements are positive and different from the corresponding elements in the subarray.
     - The sum of the subarray being at least twice its length ensures that there is enough "slack" to construct such an array `b`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints 'YES' if the subarray meets the conditions and 'NO' otherwise.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as single-element subarrays correctly by checking the length condition (`b - a + 1 > 1`).

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It efficiently computes the required conditions and produces the correct output for each query.

Correctness: **True**
