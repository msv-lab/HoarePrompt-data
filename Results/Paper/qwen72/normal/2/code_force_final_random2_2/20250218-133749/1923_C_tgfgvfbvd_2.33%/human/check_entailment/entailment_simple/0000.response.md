Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining whether a subarray of an array `c` is "good" based on the criteria provided. Let's break down the logic and check its correctness:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix sums of the array `c` and stores them in the list `p`. This is done correctly with the loop:
   ```python
   for x in l:
       c += x
       p.append(c)
   ```
   Here, `c` accumulates the sum of elements from the start of the array up to the current element, and `p` stores these cumulative sums.

2. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program determines the sum of the subarray `c[l_i]` to `c[r_i]` using the prefix sums:
   ```python
   s = p[b - 1]
   if a - 2 >= 0:
       s -= p[a - 2]
   ```
   This correctly computes the sum of the subarray from index `a-1` to `b-1` (since Python uses 0-based indexing).

3. **Good Subarray Condition**: The program checks if the subarray is "good" using the condition:
   ```python
   if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
       print('YES')
   else:
       print('NO')
   ```
   - `b - a + 1` gives the length of the subarray.
   - `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` ensures that the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray. This is necessary because each element in the corresponding array `b` must be different from the corresponding element in `c` and greater than 0.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the subarray length is 1 by checking `b - a + 1 > 1`.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the subarray sum is less than twice the length of the subarray.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
