Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each test case, it reads the list of integers and computes a prefix sum array. For each query, it checks if the sum of a specified subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the results of all queries. **
