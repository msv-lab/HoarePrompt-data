Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `i` is 0. If `f` is 0 and `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, `f` is set to 1. If `f` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than or equal to `b[i]`, `f` remains 0. If `f` is not 0 and `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, the first character of `a` is now the same as the first character of the original `b`, and the first character of `b` is now the same as the first character of the original `a`. If `f` is not 0 and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `b[i]`, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
