To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `x` and `y` are integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `a` is a list of characters with at least one element.
- `b` is a list of characters from the new input string.
- `f` is 1.
- `i` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the element at index `i` of the list `a`.
- The `end=''` parameter ensures that no newline is added after the printed character, so the output will be a single character followed by nothing (no space or newline).

### Values:
- `i` is 1, so the code will print the element at index 1 of the list `a`.

### Output:
Since `a` is a list of characters with at least one element, and `i` is 1, the code will print the second element of the list `a`.

Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list a)**
