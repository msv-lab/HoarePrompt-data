Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `f` is not 0, `i` is 0. If `a[i] > b[i]`, the first character of `a` is now the same as the first character of the original `b`, and the first character of `b` is now the same as the first character of the original `a`. Otherwise, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
