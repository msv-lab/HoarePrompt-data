Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `i` is 1, `f` remains unchanged. If `a[1]` is greater than `b[1]`, the characters at index 1 in `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
