Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two strings from the input, processes them to ensure that for any index `i`, if the character in the first string was initially greater than the character in the second string, they are swapped. It then prints the modified first string, followed by the modified second string, each on a new line. The function does not return any value. The state after the function concludes is that the input strings have been transformed and printed according to the described rules, and the flag `f` is set to 1, indicating that the processing has been completed. **
