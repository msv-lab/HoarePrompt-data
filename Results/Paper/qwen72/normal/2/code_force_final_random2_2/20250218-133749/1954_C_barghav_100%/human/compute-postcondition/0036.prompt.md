Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, x and y are integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9. `a` is a list of characters from the input string. `b` is a list of characters from the new input string. `f` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if f == 0:
        if a[i] < b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
            f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            f = 1
    elif a[i] > b[i]:
        a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `i` is 0. If `f` is 0 and `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, `f` is set to 1. If `f` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than or equal to `b[i]`, `f` remains 0. If `f` is not 0 and `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, the first character of `a` is now the same as the first character of the original `b`, and the first character of `b` is now the same as the first character of the original `a`. If `f` is not 0 and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `b[i]`, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `i` is 1. If `f` is 0, then: if `a[1]` is less than `b[1]`, `f` is set to 1, `a[1]` is now the character that was originally in `b[1]`, and `b[1]` is now the character that was originally in `a[1]`; if `a[1]` is greater than or equal to `b[1]`, `f` is set to 1 if `a[1]` is greater than `b[1]`, otherwise `f` remains unchanged. If `f` is not 0, then: if `a[1]` is greater than `b[1]`, the characters at index 1 in `a` and `b` are swapped; otherwise, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `i` is 2. If `f` is 0, then if `a[2]` is less than `b[2]`, `f` is set to 1 and the characters at index 2 of `a` and `b` are swapped. If `a[2]` is greater than `b[2]`, `f` is set to 1. If `a[2]` is not greater than `b[2]`, `f` remains 0. If `f` is 1, then if `a[2]` is greater than `b[2]`, `a[2]` and `b[2]` are swapped. Otherwise, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
