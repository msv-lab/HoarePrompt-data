The value of `k` is assigned the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

- If `n` is less than `b - a`, then `k` is equal to `n`.
- If `b - a` is less than or equal to `n`, then `k` is equal to `b - a`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `_` is a placeholder, `n` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.**
