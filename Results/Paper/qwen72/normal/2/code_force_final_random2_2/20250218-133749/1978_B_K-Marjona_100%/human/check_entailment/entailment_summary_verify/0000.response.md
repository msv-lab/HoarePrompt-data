### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for Determining `k`:**
   - The function calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This is correct because `k` should not exceed the number of buns `n` or the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a`.
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it means selling buns at the modified price would not be beneficial, so the function correctly prints `a * n`.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If `b > a`, the function calculates the profit using the formula `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
     - `b * k` accounts for the total revenue from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price.
     - `- k * (k - 1) // 2` accounts for the decreasing price of the buns sold at the modified price.
     - `(n - k) * a` accounts for the revenue from the remaining buns sold at the usual price.
   - This formula correctly reflects the problem's requirements and ensures the maximum profit is calculated.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `n`, `a`, and `b` are at their maximum values (up to \(10^9\)).
   - It also handles the case where `b` is less than or equal to `a` by simply printing `a * n`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns, considering both the usual and modified prices. The function handles all edge cases and aligns with the problem's constraints and requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
