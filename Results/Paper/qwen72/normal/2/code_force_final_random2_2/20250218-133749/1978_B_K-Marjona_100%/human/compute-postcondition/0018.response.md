To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the calculation).
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `a` is the second input integer.
- `b` is the third input integer.
- `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

### Expression to Evaluate:
```python
print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `k`:**
   - `k = min(n, b - a)`
   - This means `k` is the smaller of the two values: `n` and `b - a`.

2. **Evaluate the expression:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`
   - Let's break it down further:
     - `b * k`: This is the product of `b` and `k`.
     - `k * (k - 1) // 2`: This is the sum of the first `k-1` integers, which is a common formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
     - `(n - k) * a`: This is the product of the remaining elements (`n - k`) and `a`.

3. **Combine the parts:**
   - The final expression is: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`

### Explanation:
- `b * k` represents the contribution of the first `k` elements, each multiplied by `b`.
- `k * (k - 1) // 2` is subtracted to adjust for the overcounting of the sum of the first `k-1` integers.
- `(n - k) * a` adds the contribution of the remaining `n - k` elements, each multiplied by `a`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the expression, the output will be the result of the evaluated expression:

Output: **b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a (where k is the minimum of n and b - a)**
