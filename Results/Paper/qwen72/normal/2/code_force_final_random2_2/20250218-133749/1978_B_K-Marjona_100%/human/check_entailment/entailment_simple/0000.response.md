Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculation of `k`**:
   - The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This is correct because:
     - `k` should not exceed `n` (the number of buns).
     - `k` should not exceed `b - a` because if `k > b - a`, the modified prices would become negative, which is not allowed.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, the program prints `a * n`. This is correct because if the modified price is not more beneficial than the usual price, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price.
   - If `b > a`, the program calculates the profit as `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`. This is correct because:
     - `b * k` is the total revenue from the first `k` buns sold at modified prices.
     - `k * (k - 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, which represents the discount applied to the modified prices.
     - `(n - k) * a` is the revenue from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.

4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the maximum profit for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
