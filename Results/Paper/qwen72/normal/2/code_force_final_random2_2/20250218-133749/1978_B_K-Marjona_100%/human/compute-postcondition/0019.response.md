Postcondition: ***`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, and `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, `k` remains the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is greater than `a`, `k` also remains the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.***
