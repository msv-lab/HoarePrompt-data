The code snippet `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` after converting them to integers.

- The initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be a positive integer between 1 and 10,000. However, this condition is not directly relevant to the current code snippet, which expects three integers from the input.
- After executing the code, the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` will each hold one of the integers from the input.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are determined by the input.**
