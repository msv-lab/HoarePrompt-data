The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter since it's not used within the loop. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`.

For the loop to execute, the input must be converted to an integer that is greater than 0. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which suggests that `t` could be the number of iterations the loop should perform. However, the actual number of iterations is determined by the user input.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input is a positive integer, which will allow the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ int(input()) ≤ 10^4)**
