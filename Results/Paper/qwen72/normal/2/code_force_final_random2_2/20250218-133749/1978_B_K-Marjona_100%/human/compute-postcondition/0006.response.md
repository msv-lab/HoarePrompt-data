Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the calculation).
- `n` is an integer.
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is an integer.
- `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
- `b` is greater than `a`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `k`:**
   - `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
   - This means `k` can be either `n` or `b - a`, whichever is smaller.

2. **Calculate the expression inside the print statement:**
   - The expression is `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

3. **Break down the expression:**
   - `b * k`: This is simply `b` multiplied by `k`.
   - `k * (k - 1) // 2`: This is the sum of the first `k-1` integers, which is a common formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - `(n - k) * a`: This is the product of the difference between `n` and `k` and `a`.

4. **Combine the parts:**
   - The expression combines these three parts: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these variables and the derived value of `k`.

Output: **b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a (where k is the minimum of n and b - a, and b is greater than a)**
