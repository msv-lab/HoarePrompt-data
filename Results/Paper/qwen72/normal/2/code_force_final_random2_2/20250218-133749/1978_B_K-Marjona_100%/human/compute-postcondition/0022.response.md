Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates a value based on these inputs and prints the result. Specifically, if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`. Otherwise, it calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`, and prints `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes its execution. **
