Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the calculation).
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `a` is the second input integer.
- `b` is the third input integer.
- `k` is defined as follows:
  - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `k` is `b - a` (which is non-positive).
  - If `b` is greater than `a`, then `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine the value of `k`:**
   - If `b <= a`, then `k = b - a` (which is non-positive).
   - If `b > a`, then `k = min(n, b - a)`.

2. **Substitute `k` into the expression:**
   - The expression to be printed is `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

3. **Evaluate the expression:**
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**
     - `k = b - a` (non-positive).
     - Since `k` is non-positive, `b * k` and `k * (k - 1) // 2` will both be non-positive or zero.
     - The term `(n - k) * a` will be `n * a` because `k` is non-positive.
     - Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
       \[
       b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + n * a
       \]
       Since `k` is non-positive, the terms involving `k` will be zero or negative, but the dominant term will be `n * a`.

   - **Case 2: `b > a`**
     - `k = min(n, b - a)`.
     - Substitute `k` into the expression:
       \[
       b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a
       \]
     - This expression calculates a weighted sum where the first part is a linear term involving `b` and `k`, the second part is a quadratic term involving `k`, and the third part is a linear term involving `a` and the remaining elements after `k`.

### Final Output:
- **If `b <= a`:**
  - The output will be:
    \[
    n * a
    \]

- **If `b > a`:**
  - The output will be:
    \[
    b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a
    \]
  - Where `k = min(n, b - a)`.

### Summary:
Output: **b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a (where k is the minimum of n and b - a if b > a, otherwise k is b - a)**
