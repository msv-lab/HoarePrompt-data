For the given task, the loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `t` is truthy. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy, and zero is considered falsy.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.

Since `t` is already defined to be within the range 1 to 10^4, it is guaranteed to be a positive integer, which means it is truthy. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.**
