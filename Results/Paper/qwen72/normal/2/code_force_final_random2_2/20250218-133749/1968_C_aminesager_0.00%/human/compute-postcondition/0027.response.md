The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `line` is a new string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements [1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1]], `i` is 3, `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.**
