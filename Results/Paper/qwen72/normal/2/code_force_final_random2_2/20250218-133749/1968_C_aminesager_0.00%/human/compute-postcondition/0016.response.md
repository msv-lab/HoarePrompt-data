Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `line` is a string input by the user.
4. `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`.
5. `a` is a list containing the elements:
   - The first element is `1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])`.
   - The second element is `(999 - T[0]) - T[1]`.
   - The third element is `999 - T[0]`.
   - The fourth element is `1000`.
6. `i` is `n-1`.
7. `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input and Conversion:**
   - `n` is an integer input by the user.
   - `line` is a string input by the user.
   - `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting `line` and converting each part to an integer.

2. **List `a` Construction:**
   - The first element of `a` is `1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])`.
   - The second element of `a` is `(999 - T[0]) - T[1]`.
   - The third element of `a` is `999 - T[0]`.
   - The fourth element of `a` is `1000`.

3. **String `result` Construction:**
   - Each element of the list `a` is converted to a string.
   - These strings are joined with spaces to form the final string `result`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following inputs for clarity:
- `n = 3`
- `line = "10 20 30"`

Then:
- `T = [10, 20, 30]`

Constructing `a`:
- First element: `1000 - (10 + 20) = 1000 - 30 = 970`
- Second element: `(999 - 10) - 20 = 989 - 20 = 969`
- Third element: `999 - 10 = 989`
- Fourth element: `1000`

So, `a = [970, 969, 989, 1000]`

Constructing `result`:
- `result = "970 969 989 1000"`

### Final Output:
The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result` which is the space-separated string of the elements in the list `a`.

Output: **970 969 989 1000 (where the elements are derived from the list `a` based on the given formulae and input values)**
