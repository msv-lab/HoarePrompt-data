Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is an input integer, `line` is a new string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is [1000 - sum(T[:n-1]), ..., (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], 1000 - T[0], 1000], `i` is `n-1`, `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` updates the value of `T` to a list of integers derived from splitting the string `line` and converting each part to an integer.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `line`, `a`, `i`, and `result` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the given code snippet.
