Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `line` is a new string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is [1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], ((1000 - T[0]) - T[1]) - T[2]], `i` is 3, `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.
- Given that `i` is 3, `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[2]`, which is `(1000 - T[0]) - T[1]`.
- `T[i - 1]` refers to `T[2]`.
- Therefore, the new element appended to `a` is `((1000 - T[0]) - T[1]) - T[2]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
