Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `line` is a string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements [1000, 999 - T[0], (999 - T[0]) - T[1]], `i` is 2**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value `(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])` to the list `a`.
- Since `i` is 2, `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]`, which is `999 - T[0]`.
- `T[i - 1]` is `T[1]`.
- Therefore, the new element appended to `a` is `(999 - T[0]) - T[1]`.
- The updated list `a` now contains `[1000, 999 - T[0], (999 - T[0]) - T[1]]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
