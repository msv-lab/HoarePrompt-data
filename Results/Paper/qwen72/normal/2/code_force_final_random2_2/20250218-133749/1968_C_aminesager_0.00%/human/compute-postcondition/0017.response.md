The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be non-zero.

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `line` is a string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements [1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]), ..., (999 - T[0]) - T[1], 999 - T[0], 1000], `i` is `n-1`, `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.**
