The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increment by 1 to become 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `line` is a new string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements [1000, 1000 - T[0]], `i` is 2, `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.**
