To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `low <= high`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9
- `low` is 0
- `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`
- `max_profit` is 0

Let's analyze the condition `low <= high`:
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, both of which are at least 1.

Since `n` and `b` are both at least 1, the minimum of `n` and `b` (which is `high`) will also be at least 1. Therefore, `low` (which is 0) is always less than or equal to `high` (which is at least 1).

Thus, the condition `low <= high` is already satisfied, and no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`; `max_profit` is 0**
