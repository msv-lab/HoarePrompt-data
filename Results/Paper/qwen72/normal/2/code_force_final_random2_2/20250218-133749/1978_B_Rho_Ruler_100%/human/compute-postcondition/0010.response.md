The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is `mid - 1`; `mid` is `(0 + min(n, b)) // 2`; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is the maximum of the original `max_profit` and `profit_mid`; `profit_next` is less than or equal to `profit_mid`.**
