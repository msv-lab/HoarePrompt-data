### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Bob needs to maximize his profit from selling `n` buns.
   - He can sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i-th` bun is `(b - i + 1)`.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
     - This function calculates the total profit if `k` buns are sold at the modified price and the rest at the usual price.
     - The formula used is \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \).
     - This correctly computes the profit for a given `k`.

   - **`func_2(n, a, b)`**:
     - This function uses a binary search to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
     - It initializes `low` and `high` to `0` and `min(n, b)` respectively.
     - It iterates using binary search, calculating the profit for the current midpoint `mid` and the next midpoint `mid + 1`.
     - It updates `max_profit` with the maximum profit found so far.
     - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it adjusts the search range to the right; otherwise, it adjusts the search range to the left.
     - This ensures that the function finds the maximum profit efficiently.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The binary search approach in `func_2` ensures that the optimal `k` is found, which maximizes the profit.
   - The profit calculation in `func_1` is correct and matches the problem's requirements.
   - The main loop in the `__main__` block correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

Given the above analysis, the program meets the problem description and is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
