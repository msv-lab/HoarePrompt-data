Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the maximum profit Bob can make by selling `n` buns, where the first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`, and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at a fixed price `a`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly calculates the total profit for a given `k` using the formula `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
   - The term `k * b` represents the sum of the prices of the first `k` buns if they were all sold at `b`.
   - The term `- k * (k - 1) // 2` adjusts for the fact that the prices decrease linearly.
   - The term `(n - k) * a` represents the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the fixed price `a`.
   - This function is mathematically sound and correctly computes the profit for any valid `k`.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` to the range `[0, min(n, b)]`, which is appropriate because `k` cannot exceed `n` or `b`.
   - The binary search loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the profit for the middle value `mid` and the next value `mid + 1`.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it updates `low` to `mid + 1` to search in the upper half.
   - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1` to search in the lower half.
   - The function keeps track of the maximum profit found during the search and returns it.
   - The binary search approach is efficient and ensures that the optimal `k` is found within the given constraints.

4. **Correctness of the Binary Search**:
   - The condition `if profit_next > profit_mid` correctly determines whether to increase or decrease `k` to find the maximum profit.
   - The binary search ensures that the function explores the entire range of possible `k` values efficiently.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `n` is very large or when `b` is very small.
   - The constraints are respected, and the function should work within the given limits.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should solve the problem as described.

Final: **True**
