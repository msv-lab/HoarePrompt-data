The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `y` was 3, so the new value of `y` is 4. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the input integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 4, `cnt` is 1 + the minimum of `n` divided by 4 and `m` divided by 12 if the gcd of `x` and `y` is 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 1.**
