You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: `n` and `m` remain as the input integers, `x` is the smallest integer such that `x * x > n`, `y` is 1, and `cnt` is the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are satisfied.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: - The `print(cnt)` statement will print the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy the given conditions.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of valid pairs `(x, y)`.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates with two positive integers, n and m, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, but does not explicitly accept them as parameters. The function's return value is not specified, so its exact functionality cannot be determined without additional information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
