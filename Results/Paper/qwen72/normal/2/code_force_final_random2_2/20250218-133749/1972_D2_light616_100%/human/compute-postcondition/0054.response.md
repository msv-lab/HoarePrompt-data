Output State: **`n` is at least 18, `m` is at least 18, `x` is 4, `y` is the smallest integer such that `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`, and `cnt` is increased by the sum of the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for each iteration where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.
- In each iteration, `y` is incremented by 1.
- If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
- The loop stops when either `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m` becomes true.
- Therefore, after the loop finishes, `y` will be the smallest integer such that one of these conditions is no longer satisfied.
- The value of `cnt` will be the sum of the increments made during each iteration where the GCD condition was met.
