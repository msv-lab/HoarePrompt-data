Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 20, `x` and `y` are integers, and `y` is increased by 1. If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. Additionally, `n` and `m` must be large enough to satisfy `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.***
