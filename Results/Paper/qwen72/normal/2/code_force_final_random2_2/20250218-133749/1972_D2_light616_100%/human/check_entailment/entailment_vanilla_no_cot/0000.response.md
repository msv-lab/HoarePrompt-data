Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it is considered correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one. This is done in `func_2()`.

2. **Pair Calculation in `func_1()`**:
   - It initializes `cnt` to count the number of valid pairs.
   - It uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of `x` and `y`.
   - The outer loop runs while `x * x <= n`, which ensures that `x` does not exceed the square root of `n`.
   - The inner loop runs while `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`, ensuring that the pairs `(a, b)` are within the bounds of `n` and `m`.
   - It checks if `gcd(x, y) == 1` to ensure that `x` and `y` are coprime.
   - If they are coprime, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`, which counts the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition `b * gcd(a, b)` being a multiple of `a + b`.

3. **Output**: After processing all pairs for a given test case, it prints the count `cnt`.

The logic and implementation seem to align with the problem requirements, and the constraints are handled appropriately. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
