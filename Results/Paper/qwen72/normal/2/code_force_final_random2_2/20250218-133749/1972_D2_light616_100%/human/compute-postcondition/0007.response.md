Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `func_1()` has been called `t` times.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: `t` is an input integer within the range 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- **Loop Execution**: The loop runs `t` times, and during each iteration, the function `func_1()` is called.
- **Final State**: After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the function `func_1()` will have been called exactly `t` times. The value of `t` itself remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `t`; it simply iterates `t` times.

Thus, the final output state is that `t` is still an input integer within the range 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `func_1()` has been called `t` times.
