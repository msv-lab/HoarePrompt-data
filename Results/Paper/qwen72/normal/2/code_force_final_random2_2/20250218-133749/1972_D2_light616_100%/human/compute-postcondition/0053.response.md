The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 20, `x` and `y` are integers, `y` is increased by 3. If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`, and `n` and `m` must be large enough to satisfy `(x + y + 2) * x <= n` and `(x + y + 2) * (y + 2) <= m`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.**
