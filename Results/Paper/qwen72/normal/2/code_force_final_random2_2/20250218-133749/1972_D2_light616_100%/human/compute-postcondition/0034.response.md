The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the GCD of `x` (which is 3) and the new value of `y` (which is 4) is 1, the postcondition remains valid.

Output State: **`n` is at least 18, `m` is at least 18, `x` is 3, `y` is 4, `cnt` is increased by 1, and the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1.**
