Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are updated to the input integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 3. If the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is updated to 1 + the minimum of `n` divided by 4 and `m` divided by 12. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 1.***
