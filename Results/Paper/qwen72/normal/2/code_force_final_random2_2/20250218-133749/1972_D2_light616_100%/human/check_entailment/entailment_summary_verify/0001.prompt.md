You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. It then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` remains the same integer that was input by the user, and `func_1` has been executed `t` times.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
   - The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) must be a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to solve one test case.
   - It iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) where \(x\) and \(y\) are potential values for \(a\) and \(b\) respectively.
   - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, which simplifies the problem.
   - The inner loop checks if \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - If the gcd condition is met, it counts the number of valid pairs using `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.

3. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The logic inside `func_1` correctly identifies pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The use of `math.gcd` ensures that the pairs are coprime, which is necessary for the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) to be a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - The counting mechanism using `min` ensures that the pairs are within the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).

4. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases \(t\) and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - This structure is correct for handling multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as when \(n\) and \(m\) are small (e.g., \(n = 1, m = 1\)).
   - The constraints \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\) are respected by the loops and conditions.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It correctly identifies and counts the valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case.
