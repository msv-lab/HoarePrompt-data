The value of `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of two expressions: `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. Given that `y` is increased by 1, the new value of `y` is `y + 1`. The conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` must still hold true.

Let's denote the new value of `y` as `y_new = y + 1`.

The new value of `cnt` is calculated as:
- `cnt += min(n // ((x + y_new) * x), m // ((x + y_new) * y_new))`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is at least 20, `x` and `y` are integers, `y` is now `y + 1`, `n` and `m` must be large enough to satisfy `(x + y + 1) * x <= n` and `(x + y + 1) * (y + 1) <= m`, and `cnt` is increased by `min(n // ((x + y + 1) * x), m // ((x + y + 1) * (y + 1)))`.**
