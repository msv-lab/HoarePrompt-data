Output State: **`n` is at least 18, `m` is at least 18, `x` is 3, `y` is 5, and `cnt` is increased by 2.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State:** The loop starts with `x = 3`, `y = 1`, and `cnt` is initialized based on the initial conditions.
- **First Iteration:** The loop checks if `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. For `x = 3` and `y = 1`, this means `4 * 3 <= n` and `4 * 1 <= m`, which simplifies to `12 <= n` and `4 <= m`. Since `gcd(3, 1) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 12, m // 4)`. After this iteration, `y` is incremented to 2.
- **Second Iteration:** Now, `x = 3` and `y = 2`. The loop checks if `5 * 3 <= n` and `5 * 2 <= m`, which simplifies to `15 <= n` and `10 <= m`. Since `gcd(3, 2) != 1`, `cnt` is not incremented. After this iteration, `y` is incremented to 3.
- **Third Iteration:** Now, `x = 3` and `y = 3`. The loop checks if `6 * 3 <= n` and `6 * 3 <= m`, which simplifies to `18 <= n` and `18 <= m`. Since `gcd(3, 3) != 1`, `cnt` is not incremented. After this iteration, `y` is incremented to 4.
- **Fourth Iteration:** Now, `x = 3` and `y = 4`. The loop checks if `7 * 3 <= n` and `7 * 4 <= m`, which simplifies to `21 <= n` and `28 <= m`. Since `gcd(3, 4) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 21, m // 28)`. After this iteration, `y` is incremented to 5.
- **Fifth Iteration:** Now, `x = 3` and `y = 5`. The loop checks if `8 * 3 <= n` and `8 * 5 <= m`, which simplifies to `24 <= n` and `40 <= m`. Since `gcd(3, 5) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 24, m // 40)`. After this iteration, `y` is incremented to 6.
- **Termination:** The loop continues until `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`. Given the constraints, the loop will terminate after the fifth iteration because `9 * 3 = 27` and `9 * 6 = 54` would exceed the given `n` and `m` values.

Thus, after all iterations, the final state is:
- `n` is at least 18
- `m` is at least 18
- `x` remains 3
- `y` is 5
- `cnt` is increased by 2 (from the fourth and fifth iterations).
