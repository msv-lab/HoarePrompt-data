The function `func_2` reads input from standard input (stdin). It expects the first line to contain four space-separated integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, representing the number of rows, the number of columns, the number of bridges, and the maximum distance between supports, respectively. It then reads `n` additional lines, each containing `m` space-separated integers representing the depths of the river cells. The function computes the cost for each row using the helper function `func_1` and stores these costs in a list. It calculates the sum of every contiguous subsequence of `k` elements in the costs list and prints the minimum of these sums. The function does not return any value; it only prints the minimum sum to the standard output.
