Output State: **The program returns the last element of the list `row`, which has been updated to `min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) + row[i] + 1`, where `i` is `len(row) - 1`. This means the last element is the minimum value from the sublist starting from the maximum of 0 or `i - (d + 1)` up to `i`, added to the current value of the last element of `row`, plus 1.**
