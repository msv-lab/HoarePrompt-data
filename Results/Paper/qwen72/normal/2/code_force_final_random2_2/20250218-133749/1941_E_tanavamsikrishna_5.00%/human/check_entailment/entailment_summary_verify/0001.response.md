### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the minimum cost to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(row: List[int], d: int)`**:
     - This function calculates the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row.
     - It iterates through the row and updates the cost of each cell based on the minimum cost of the previous cells within the distance `d`.
     - The final cost for the row is the value at the last cell after processing.
     - **Correctness**: The function correctly updates the cost for each cell by considering the minimum cost of the previous cells within the distance `d`. The final cost is correctly returned as the value at the last cell.

   - **`func_2()`**:
     - This function reads the input, processes each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.
     - It reads the dimensions and parameters from the input.
     - It processes each row to get the cost of building a bridge on that row.
     - It then calculates the total cost for all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.
     - **Correctness**: The function correctly reads the input and processes each row using `func_1`. It then uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows. The output is correctly printed.

3. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input is read correctly using `input().split(' ')` and converted to integers.
   - The output is printed correctly using `print(min(total_costs))`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the constraints well, including the edge cases where `k` is 1 or `m` is small.
   - The function ensures that the first and last columns are always included in the cost calculation.

5. **Algorithm Validity**:
   - The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` is correct for calculating the minimum cost for a single row.
   - The sliding window approach in `func_2` is correct for finding the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.
