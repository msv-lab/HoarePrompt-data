To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i`.
   - The expression `len(costs) - (k - 1)` determines the range of the loop.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the range must be greater than 0.
   - This means `len(costs) - (k - 1) > 0`.

3. **Simplify the Condition:**
   - `len(costs) - (k - 1) > 0` simplifies to `len(costs) > k - 1`.
   - Therefore, `len(costs)` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

4. **Adjust States:**
   - `i` should start at 0.
   - `len(costs)` must be at least `k`.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `i` is 0.
- `len(costs)` must be at least `k`.

### State:
**`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the first four space-separated integers from the input. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from a separate line of input. `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` with a row from `rows` and `d` as arguments. `total_costs` is an empty list. `i` is 0, `len(costs)` must be at least `k`.**
