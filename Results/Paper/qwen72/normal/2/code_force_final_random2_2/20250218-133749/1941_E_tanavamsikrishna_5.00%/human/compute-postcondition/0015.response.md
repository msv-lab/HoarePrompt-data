The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `row` and `d`. `row` is a list of non-negative integers representing the depths of the river cells in a single row, and `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports, with the constraint that 1 <= d <= len(row). The function updates the last element of the list `row` to be the minimum value from the sublist starting from the maximum of 0 or `i - (d + 1)` up to `i`, added to the current value of the last element of `row`, plus 1, where `i` is `len(row) - 1`. The function then returns this updated last element of the list `row`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers and a positive integer `d`. It updates the last element of `row` to be the minimum value from a specified sublist plus the current value of the last element plus 1, and returns this updated value.**
