#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of non-negative integers representing the depths of the river cells in a single row, and d is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= d <= len(row).
def func_1(row, d):
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
        
    #State: `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d-1` elements are each increased by 1, `d` is a positive integer, and `i` is `d-2`.
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
        
    #State: `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d-1` elements are each increased by 1, `d` is a positive integer, `i` is `len(row) - 1`, `len(row)` is greater than or equal to `d`, and each element from index `d-1` to `len(row)-1` in `row` has been updated to `min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) + row[i] + 1`.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list `row`, which has been updated to `min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) + row[i] + 1`, where `i` is `len(row) - 1`. This means the last element is the minimum value from the sublist starting from the maximum of 0 or `i - (d + 1)` up to `i`, added to the current value of the last element of `row`, plus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `row` of non-negative integers and a positive integer `d` as inputs. It modifies the first `d-1` elements of `row` by incrementing each by 1. For the remaining elements starting from index `d-1` to the end of the list, each element is updated to the sum of its current value, 1, and the minimum value from a sublist of `row` that starts from the maximum of 0 or `i - (d + 1)` up to `i`. The function returns the last element of the modified `row` list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed into the function `func_2`. However, the function expects input from stdin where the first line contains four space-separated integers n, m, k, and d representing the number of rows, the number of columns, the number of bridges, and the maximum distance between supports, respectively. The subsequent n lines contain m space-separated integers representing the depths of the river cells in each row.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the first four space-separated integers from the input. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from a separate line of input. `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` with a row from `rows` and `d` as arguments. `total_costs` is a list containing the sums of every contiguous subsequence of `k` elements in `costs`. The length of `total_costs` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of every contiguous subsequence of k elements in the costs list)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from standard input (stdin). It expects the first line to contain four space-separated integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, representing the number of rows, the number of columns, the number of bridges, and the maximum distance between supports, respectively. It then reads `n` additional lines, each containing `m` space-separated integers representing the depths of the river cells. The function computes the cost for each row using the helper function `func_1` and stores these costs in a list. It calculates the sum of every contiguous subsequence of `k` elements in the costs list and prints the minimum of these sums. The function does not return any value; it only prints the minimum sum to the standard output.
