To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(total_costs))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the first four space-separated integers from the input.
   - `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from a separate line of input.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` with a row from `rows` and `d` as arguments.
     - This means `costs[i] = func_1(rows[i], d)` for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.

3. **Total Costs Calculation:**
   - `total_costs` is a list containing the sums of every contiguous subsequence of `k` elements in `costs`.
     - For example, if `costs = [c1, c2, c3, c4, c5]` and `k = 3`, then `total_costs` would be `[c1 + c2 + c3, c2 + c3 + c4, c3 + c4 + c5]`.
     - The length of `total_costs` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

4. **Finding the Minimum Total Cost:**
   - The `min(total_costs)` function finds the smallest value in the `total_costs` list.

Given this breakdown, the `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum value from the `total_costs` list.

### Explanation of Variables:
- `n`: Number of rows in the input.
- `m`: Number of columns in each row (not directly used in the final calculation).
- `k`: Length of the contiguous subsequences to sum.
- `d`: Parameter passed to `func_1`.
- `rows`: List of lists, where each inner list represents a row of integers.
- `costs`: List of costs calculated by applying `func_1` to each row.
- `total_costs`: List of sums of every contiguous subsequence of `k` elements in `costs`.

### Final Output:
The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum value from the `total_costs` list, which is the smallest sum of any contiguous subsequence of `k` elements in the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of every contiguous subsequence of k elements in the costs list)**
