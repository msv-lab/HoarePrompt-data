Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly, including the number of test cases, the dimensions of the river grid, the number of bridges, and the maximum distance between supports.

2. **Cost Calculation for Each Row**:
   - `func_1` calculates the cost of building a bridge on a single row.
   - It iterates through the row, updating the cost for each cell based on the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus the current cell's depth plus 1.
   - The function returns the cost of the last cell, which represents the total cost of building a bridge on that row.

3. **Total Cost Calculation for Multiple Bridges**:
   - `func_2` reads the input and calls `func_1` for each row to get the cost of building a bridge on that row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of every possible contiguous subsequence of `k` rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among these subsequences.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases correctly, such as when the river grid is small or when `d` is large.

Given the above analysis, the program seems to correctly implement the required logic and should produce the correct output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
