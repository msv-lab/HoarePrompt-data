The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input from the standard input (stdin). The first line of input contains four space-separated integers: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, which represent the number of rows, the number of columns, the number of bridges, and the maximum distance between supports, respectively. The subsequent `n` lines contain `m` space-separated integers each, representing the depths of the river cells in each row.

The function processes this input and performs some operations based on the provided data. However, the specific output or return value of the function is not explicitly described in the given information.

Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, representing the number of rows, the number of columns, the number of bridges, and the maximum distance between supports, respectively. The next `n` lines contain `m` integers each, representing the depths of the river cells. The function processes this input but the specific output or return value is not specified.**
