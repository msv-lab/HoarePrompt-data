Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by 1. If `check_all` is `True`, then all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order. If `check_all` is `False`, then there exists at least one pair of consecutive elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` that are in decreasing order. Additionally, if `check_all` is `False`, the loop will print 'YES' if there exists an index `i` such that `a[i - 1] > a[i]` and the sublist `a[i:]` is in non-decreasing order and all elements in this sublist are less than or equal to `a[0]`. Otherwise, the loop will print 'NO'.***
