Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `check_all` is `False`.
- `i` is 1.
- `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
- `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end.
- `check_all_new` is the result of the expression `all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])`.
- `new_all` is the result of the expression `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`.
- Either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the logic:

1. `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, which means the first element of `a` is greater than the second element of `a`.
2. `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end, so `new` contains all elements of `a` except the first one.
3. `check_all_new` checks if the first element of `a` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`.
4. `new_all` checks if the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.
5. The condition states that either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`.

Since either `check_all_new` or `new_all` is `False`, the conditions for the list to be sorted in a specific way are not met. Therefore, the code will print 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
