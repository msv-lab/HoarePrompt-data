Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by 1, and `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. If `check_all` is `True`, the program maintains these conditions. If `check_all` is `False`, `n` remains the same as the initial input integer, `a` remains the same list of integers, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations (`n-1`), and `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Additionally, if at any point during the loop `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from that index to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`, and `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. The loop exits immediately after the first iteration where `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]` and either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, or if both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`. If no such condition is met, the loop completes all iterations.***
