The provided code snippet updates the value of `check_all_new` based on whether all elements in the `new` list (which starts from index 2 of `a`) are less than or equal to the first element of `a`.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

- `check_all_new` is recalculated using the condition `all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])`. This means `check_all_new` will be `True` if every element in `new` is less than or equal to the first element of `a`, and `False` otherwise.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `_`, `check_all`, `new`, and `new_all` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `_` is incremented by 1, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.**
