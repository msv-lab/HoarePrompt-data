Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `check_all` is False, `i` is 2, `new` is a list containing elements from index 2 to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is False, `new_all` is True if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
