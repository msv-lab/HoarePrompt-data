Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This code snippet simply prints the string `'YES'`. The value of `check_all` and other variables do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it does not depend on any of these variables.

Output: **YES**
