The variables in the loop head are `i` and `w`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `w`. If `i` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `w`. Since `i` is 3, `w` must be greater than 3. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\). `M` is a list containing the integer value of the square root of `q` and the integer `1`. If `q` is divisible by 2 and `q // 2` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` also contains the value `q // 2`. `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 3, `i` is 3**
