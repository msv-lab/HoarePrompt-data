Postcondition: ***`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `M` is a list containing the integer value of the square root of `q` and the integer `1`, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `q` is divisible by `i` (which is 1). If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` contains the integer value of the square root of `q` and the integer `1`.***
