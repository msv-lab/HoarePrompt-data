Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\). `M` is a list containing the integer value of the square root of `q`, the integer `1`, and the integer `q // 2` if `q` is divisible by `2` and `q // 2` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. Additionally, `M` now also contains the integer `q // 2`. `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `M` contains the integer value of the square root of `q` and the integer `1`.
- If `i` (which is 2) is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` also contains the integer `2`.
- If `q` is divisible by `2` and `q // 2` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` also contains the value `q // 2`.
- The code `M += [q // i]` appends the value `q // 2` to the list `M`.
- Since `i` is 2, `q // i` is equivalent to `q // 2`.
- Therefore, `M` now contains the integer value of the square root of `q`, the integer `1`, and the integer `q // 2` (if the conditions for including `2` and `q // 2` were met).
- The values of `q`, `x`, `w`, and `i` remain unchanged.
