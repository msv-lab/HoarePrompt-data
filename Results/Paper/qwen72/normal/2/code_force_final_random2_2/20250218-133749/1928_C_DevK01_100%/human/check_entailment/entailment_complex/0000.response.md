### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves determining the number of possible values of \( k \) that fit the given constraints based on Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the pattern alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers from 1 to \( k \).

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even.
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls the function `func_1` with arguments \((y - 2) // 2\) and \( x \).
   - It then checks if \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and, if true, calls `func_1` again with arguments \((n - x) // 2\) and \( x \).
   - It combines the results from both calls, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters \( q \) and \( x \).
   - It initializes an empty list \( M \).
   - It calculates the square root of \( q \) and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). If so, it adds it to \( M \).
   - It iterates through all integers \( i \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{q} \) and checks if \( i \) is a divisor of \( q \).
   - If \( i \) is a divisor and \( i \geq x - 1 \), it adds \( i \) to \( M \).
   - If \( q // i \geq x - 1 \), it adds \( q // i \) to \( M \).
   - Finally, it returns the list \( M \).

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.
   - The logic for checking if \( y \) is even is correct.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \) and their corresponding quotients.
   - The program correctly combines the results from both calls to `func_1` and removes duplicates before printing the final count.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
