Postcondition: ***`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\). `M` is a list containing the integer value of the square root of `q`, the integer `1`, and the integer `3`. If `q` is divisible by 2 and `q // 2` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` also contains the value `q // 2`. `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 3, `i` is 3. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` contains the additional integer `3`.***
