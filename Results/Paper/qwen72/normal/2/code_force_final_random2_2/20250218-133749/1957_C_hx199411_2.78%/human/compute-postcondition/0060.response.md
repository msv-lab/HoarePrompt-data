The provided code snippet reads two integers from user input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. This impacts the values of `c` and `r`, which are updated to the integers provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `m`, and `num`) are not directly affected by this code, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `m` is `n`. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 3 if the condition is checked in the if part, and `num` is 4 if the condition is checked in the else part.**
