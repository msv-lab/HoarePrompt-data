Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of calculating the number of different final configurations possible after continuing a game of placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard, following specific rules. The key points to verify for correctness include:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case, including the size of the chessboard and the initial moves made.

2. **Counting Initial Moves**: The program counts the number of moves where the player and the computer place rooks in the same row and column (`c == r`) and where they do not (`c != r`). This is crucial for determining the number of remaining positions available for placing rooks.

3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations. The `dp` array is initialized correctly, with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, which are the base cases for the recurrence relation.

4. **Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation used in the dynamic programming approach is:
   \[
   dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
   \]
   This relation accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions, considering the constraints of the problem.

5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the result for each test case based on the calculated `dp` values.

After reviewing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The input handling, counting of initial moves, dynamic programming setup, and output are all consistent with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
