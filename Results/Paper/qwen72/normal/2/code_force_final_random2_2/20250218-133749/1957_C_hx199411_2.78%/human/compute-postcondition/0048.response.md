Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `num` is 0, `m` is `n`.** 

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `c` and `r`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `num`, `m`) remain unchanged. The values of `c` and `r` are now the integers provided by the user.
