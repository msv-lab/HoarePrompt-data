The provided code reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. This impacts the values of `c` and `r` but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `m` is `n`. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2 and `c` is not equal to `r`.**
