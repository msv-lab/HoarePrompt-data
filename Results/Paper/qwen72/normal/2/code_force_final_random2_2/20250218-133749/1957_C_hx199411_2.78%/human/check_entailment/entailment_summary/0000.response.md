Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of calculating the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard, given that some initial moves have been made and the computer mirrors these moves. The key aspects to verify are:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case (chessboard size `n` and number of moves `k`). It also reads the `k` moves correctly.

2. **Initial Calculation of `num`**:
   - The variable `num` is used to count the number of positions that are already occupied or blocked due to the initial moves and their mirrored counterparts.
   - For each move `(r, c)`, if `r == c`, it adds 1 to `num` because the computer's move will be the same position, and thus only one position is blocked.
   - If `r != c`, it adds 2 to `num` because the computer's move will be at `(c, r)`, blocking two positions.

3. **Calculation of `m`**:
   - `m` is calculated as `n - num`, representing the number of remaining positions that can still be used for placing rooks.

4. **Dynamic Programming Solution**:
   - If `m` is 0, there are no more positions available, so the function prints 0.
   - If `m` is 1, there is exactly one position left, so the function prints 1.
   - For `m > 1`, the function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations. The recurrence relation used is:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
     This relation accounts for the fact that a rook can be placed in a new row or column, and the remaining positions can be filled in multiple ways.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case, ensuring that the output is modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for calculating the number of configurations, and the input handling and initial calculations are done correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
