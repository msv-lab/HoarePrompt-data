Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are the last integers provided by the user input, `m` is `n - num`, where `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`. Additionally, `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1. `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, and `dp[1]` is set to 1.**
