The code snippet `m = n - num` updates the value of `m` by subtracting `num` from `n`. Here, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`. Since the exact number of iterations and the values of `c` and `r` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `num`. However, we know that `m` will be updated to `n - num`.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are the last integers provided by the user input, `m` is `n - num`, where `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`.**
