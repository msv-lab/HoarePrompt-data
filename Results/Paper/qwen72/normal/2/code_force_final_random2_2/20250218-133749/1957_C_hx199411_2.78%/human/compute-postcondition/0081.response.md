Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `m - 1`, `c` and `r` are the last integers provided by the user input, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3, and for each index `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is updated to `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains a non-zero integer within the specified range, decremented by 1.
- **`n`**: Remains the new integer value provided by the user input.
- **`k`**: Must still be greater than or equal to 0.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `m - 1` because the loop iterates from 3 to `m`.
- **`c` and `r`**: Remain the last integers provided by the user input.
- **`m`**: Must still be greater than or equal to 3.
- **`dp`**: The list `dp` is updated such that for each index `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is calculated as `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. This means the final state of `dp` will reflect the results of all the iterations of the loop.
