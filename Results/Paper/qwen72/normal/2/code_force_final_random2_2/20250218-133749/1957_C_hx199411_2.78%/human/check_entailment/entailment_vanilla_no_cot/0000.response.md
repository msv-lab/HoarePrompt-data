Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading the board size `n` and the number of initial moves `k`, and then calculates the number of possible final configurations considering the rules of the game. The dynamic programming approach used to calculate the number of configurations for the remaining positions is appropriate for this problem, taking into account the constraints and the need to compute results modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The logic for handling the initial moves and adjusting the count of available positions (`m`) is also correctly implemented. Therefore, the program seems to be correct based on the problem statement.
