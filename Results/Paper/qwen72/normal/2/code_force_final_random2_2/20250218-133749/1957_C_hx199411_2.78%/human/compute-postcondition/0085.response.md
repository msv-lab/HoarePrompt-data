The loop condition is based on the variable `t`, which must be a non-zero integer for the loop to continue executing. Given that `t` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 (decremented by 1). To allow the loop to execute one more time, `t` should still be a non-zero integer, meaning it must be greater than 0.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted, as the continuation of the loop solely depends on the value of `t`.

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 (decremented by 1)**
