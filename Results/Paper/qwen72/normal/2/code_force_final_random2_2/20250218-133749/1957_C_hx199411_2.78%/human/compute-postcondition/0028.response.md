Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5.
- `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `i` is `k-1`.
- `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
- `num` is the total count of increments based on the conditions inside the loop.
- `m` is `n - num`.
- `m` is not equal to 0.
- The current value of `m` is 1.

Given this information, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(1)
```

The `print` statement will simply print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
