Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are the last integers provided by the user input, `m` is `n`. The variable `num` will be the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains a non-zero integer within the given range, decremented by 1.
- **`n`**: Remains the new integer value provided by the user input.
- **`k`**: After the loop, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- **`i`**: After the loop, `i` will be `k-1`, as it is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
- **`c` and `r`**: These variables will hold the last integers provided by the user input during the final iteration of the loop.
- **`m`**: Remains `n`, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`num`**: This variable accumulates the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`. Therefore, `num` will be the total count based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop.
