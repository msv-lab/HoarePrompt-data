For the given task, the state right before the while loop is described as follows:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.

The `while` loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `t` is non-zero. Given that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `t` is already guaranteed to be non-zero at the start, ensuring that the loop can execute at least once.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played, respectively. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.**
