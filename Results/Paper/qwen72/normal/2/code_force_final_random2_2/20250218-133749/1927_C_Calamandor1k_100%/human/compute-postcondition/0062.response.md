Output State: **The program returns a list named 'results' which contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple that was originally in the `cases` list. The length of the `results` list is equal to the number of tuples that were processed, and each element corresponds to whether the conditions for the respective tuple were met ('YES') or not ('NO').**
