Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, the first tuple in `cases` is `(n, m, k, a, b)` where `n` and `m` are integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5), `k` is an even integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m)), `a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), and `b` is a list of integers of length `m` (1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6), `results` is an empty list, `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`.**
