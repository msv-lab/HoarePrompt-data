The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases` as inputs. Each tuple in `cases` consists of five elements: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is an even integer, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers. The function processes each tuple to determine if certain conditions are met, specifically checking the distinct elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`. It returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple, indicating whether the conditions were met ('YES') or not ('NO'). The length of the `results` list is equal to the number of tuples in `cases`. The original `cases` list remains unchanged.
