Output State: **All variables remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next line of code outside the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration, or to the next line of code outside the loop if the `continue` statement is not inside a loop. Since the `continue` statement does not modify any variables, all variables retain their initial values. Therefore, the output state is identical to the initial state, with the additional note that the program continues to the next iteration or the next line of code.
