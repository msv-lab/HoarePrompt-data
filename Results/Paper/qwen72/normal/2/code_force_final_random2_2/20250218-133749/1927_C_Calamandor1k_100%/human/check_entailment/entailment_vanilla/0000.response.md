### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Set Operations**:
   - The program creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` from the elements of arrays `a` and `b` respectively. This ensures that each element is considered only once.
   - It then filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to `k`, resulting in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.

3. **Set Differences and Intersections**:
   - The program calculates the elements that are unique to `a` (`only_a`) and unique to `b` (`only_b`).
   - It also calculates the elements that are present in both `a` and `b` (`both`).

4. **Conditions for Validity**:
   - The program checks if the number of unique elements in `only_a` exceeds `k // 2`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results because it's impossible to choose `k // 2` elements from `a` that are not in `b`.
   - Similarly, it checks if the number of unique elements in `only_b` exceeds `k // 2`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - It then checks if the total number of distinct elements (sum of elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) is less than `k`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results because it's impossible to cover all numbers from 1 to `k`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the program appends 'YES' to the results, indicating that it is possible to choose the required elements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose exactly `k // 2` elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to `k` is included. The steps and conditions are logically sound and cover all necessary cases.

Correctness: **True**
