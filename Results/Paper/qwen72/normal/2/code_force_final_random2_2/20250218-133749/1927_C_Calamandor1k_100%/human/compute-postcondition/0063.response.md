The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cases`. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains five elements: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5), `k` is an even integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m)), and `a` and `b` are lists of integers (1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6) with lengths `n` and `m` respectively. The sum of values `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 4·10^5.

The function processes each tuple in the `cases` list and returns a list named `results` which contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple. The length of the `results` list is equal to the number of tuples that were processed, and each element corresponds to whether the conditions for the respective tuple were met ('YES') or not ('NO').

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple contains `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is an even integer, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers. The function returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple, indicating whether the conditions for that tuple were met.**
