Output State: **All variables remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next line of code outside the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, all variables retain their previous values. The condition that led to the `continue` statement (`len(only_b) > k // 2`) remains true, but no changes are made to the variables.
