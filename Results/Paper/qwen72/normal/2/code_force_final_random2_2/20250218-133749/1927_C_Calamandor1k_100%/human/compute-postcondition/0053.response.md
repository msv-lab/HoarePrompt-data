The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples with at least two tuples, the next tuple in `cases` is the second tuple, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES', 'YES', 'NO'. If `len(only_a) > k // 2`, `results` also contains the string 'NO'. `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is now a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. If `len(only_a) > k // 2`, all variables remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next line of code outside the loop. If `len(only_a) <= k // 2`, all variables remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next line of code.**
