Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a fundamental issue with the program's approach to calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The program uses the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` to calculate the contribution of each friendship value, which is indeed incorrect. This formula assumes a linear increase in the friendship value for each excursion, which does not account for the probabilistic nature of the selection process.

### Key Points:
1. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` is used to calculate the contribution of each friendship value. This formula assumes that the friendship value increases linearly with each excursion, which is not correct. The correct approach should consider the probability of selecting a pair of friends and how their friendship value changes over the excursions.

2. **Probability of Selection**: The probability of selecting a specific pair of friends is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \). The expected increase in the friendship value for each excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

3. **Expected Value Calculation**: The total expected value for a pair of friends over k excursions should be:
   \[
   \text{Expected Value} = f_i + k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}
   \]
   This formula correctly accounts for the probabilistic nature of the selection process.

### Example Case:
Consider the test case:
- \( n = 3 \)
- \( m = 1 \)
- \( k = 2 \)
- Friendship: \( (1, 2, 1) \)

The correct expected value for this case should be:
\[
\text{Expected Value} = 1 + 2 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

However, the program will output:
\[
1 \times (2 \times 3 // 2) = 3
\]

This is clearly incorrect, as the expected value should be \( \frac{5}{3} \).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the incorrect formula used in the program and providing a correct approach to calculate the expected value. The program's logic is flawed, and it does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

Final: **False**
