Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, where each inner list contains integers provided by the user input, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are now integers provided by the user input.
- The initial condition that `t` must be greater than or equal to 0 remains unchanged.
- The variable `friendships` remains a list of `m` lists, where each inner list contains integers provided by the user input.
- The variable `result` is still the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.
