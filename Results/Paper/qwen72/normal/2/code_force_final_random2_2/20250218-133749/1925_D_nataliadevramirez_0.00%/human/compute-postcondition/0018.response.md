Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by `m` lines of friendship data. It then calls another function `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result of `func_1` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution, and the state of the program is such that all input has been processed and the corresponding results have been printed. **
