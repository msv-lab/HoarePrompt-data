The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as the current value of `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

Since `_` is not explicitly tracked outside the loop, it's implied that it starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration. Therefore, if `t` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it must now be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, where each inner list contains integers provided by the user input, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**
