The function `func_2` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: A positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `n`: An integer representing the number of individuals, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `m`: An integer representing the number of friendships, where 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2).
- `k`: An integer representing a specific condition or threshold, where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `friendships`: A list of m lists, each containing three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9.

Given these parameters, the function processes the data and returns a result based on the input. However, the specific output is not clearly defined in the problem statement. To provide a meaningful description, I will assume that the function returns a list of results, one for each test case, where each result is determined by the processing of the `friendships` data according to the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. It processes the `friendships` data for each of the `t` test cases and returns a list of results, where each result is determined by the processing of the friendship data according to the given constraints.**
