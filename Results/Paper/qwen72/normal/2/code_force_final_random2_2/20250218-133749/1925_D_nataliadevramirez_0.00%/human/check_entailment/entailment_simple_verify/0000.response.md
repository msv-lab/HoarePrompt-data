Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the program's logic. The program uses the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` to calculate the contribution of each friendship value, which is indeed incorrect. This formula assumes a linear increase in the friendship value for each pair over the excursions, which does not account for the probabilistic nature of the selection process.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair of friends over the k excursions. The key steps are:

1. **Calculate the Probability of Selecting a Pair**: The probability of selecting any specific pair of friends is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \), where \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

2. **Expected Increase in Friendship Value**: For each pair of friends, the expected increase in the friendship value per excursion is the probability of selecting that pair. Over k excursions, the expected increase in the friendship value is \( k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

3. **Total Expected Value**: For each pair of friends, the total expected value after k excursions is the initial friendship value plus the expected increase over k excursions:
   \[
   \text{Expected Value} = f_i + k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}
   \]

4. **Sum of Expected Values**: Sum the expected values for all pairs of friends to get the total expected value.

### Example Case:
Consider the test case:
- \( n = 3 \)
- \( m = 1 \)
- \( k = 2 \)
- Friendship: \( (1, 2, 1) \)

The correct expected value for this case should be:
\[
\text{Expected Value} = 1 + 2 \times \frac{1}{\binom{3}{2}} = 1 + 2 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

However, the program will output:
\[
1 \times (2 \times 3 // 2) = 3
\]

This is clearly incorrect, as the expected value should be \( \frac{5}{3} \).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the logical error in the program. The program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

Final: **False**
