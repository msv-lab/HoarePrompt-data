### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen during the excursions.
   - The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if they are chosen again.
   - The final answer should be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function takes `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` as input.
     - It iterates over each friendship and calculates the contribution of each friendship to the total sum.
     - The formula used is `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`, which calculates the sum of the first `k` natural numbers multiplied by the initial friendship value `f`.
     - This formula correctly accounts for the increasing friendship value over the excursions.
     - The result is accumulated and returned modulo `MOD`.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
     - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then reads `m` lines of friendship data.
     - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.
     - The function correctly processes the input and output for multiple test cases.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The formula used in `func_1` is mathematically sound for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
   - The modular arithmetic is correctly applied to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.
   - The input and output handling in `func_2` is correct and matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Both functions work together to handle multiple test cases and produce the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
