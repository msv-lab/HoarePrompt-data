Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, where each inner list contains integers provided by the user input, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**.

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the `friendships` variable to be a list of `m` lists, where each inner list contains integers provided by the user input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.
- The `result` variable remains as the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`, which is not affected by the code snippet.
