To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `_` and `t`.

Given:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50000, inclusive.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
