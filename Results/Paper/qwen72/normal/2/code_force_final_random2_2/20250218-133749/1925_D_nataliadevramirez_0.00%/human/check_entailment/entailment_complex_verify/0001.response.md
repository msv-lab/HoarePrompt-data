### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen during \(k\) excursions.
   - Each pair's friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if they are chosen again.
   - The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1:**
     - This function calculates the result for a single test case.
     - It iterates over each friendship and multiplies the initial friendship value \(f\) by the sum of the first \(k\) natural numbers, which is \(\frac{k(k + 1)}{2}\).
     - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure it fits within the required constraints.
     - The formula \(\frac{k(k + 1)}{2}\) correctly represents the sum of the first \(k\) natural numbers, which is the expected increase in friendship value over \(k\) excursions.
     - However, the formula used in the code, \(f \times \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \mod (10^9 + 7)\), does not account for the fact that the friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion. The correct formula should consider the probability of choosing each pair and the expected increase in friendship value.

   - **func_2:**
     - This function handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases \(t\).
     - For each test case, it reads the values of \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\), and the list of friendships.
     - It calls `func_1` to compute the result for the current test case and prints it.
     - The handling of multiple test cases is correct.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair.
   - The formula \(\frac{k(k + 1)}{2}\) is used incorrectly. The expected value should be calculated as the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase in friendship value over \(k\) excursions.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for each pair is \(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}\), where \(\binom{n}{2}\) is the total number of possible pairs of children.
   - The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values is:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i + \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \times \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}
     \]
   - The current implementation in `func_1` does not account for the probability of choosing each pair and the expected increase in friendship value.
