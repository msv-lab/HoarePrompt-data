Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. It reads the number of test cases `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and for each test case, it reads `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2). For each test case, the function prints `n` if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1; otherwise, it prints 1. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that the specified number of test cases have been processed and the appropriate outputs have been printed for each. **
