You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. It reads the number of test cases `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and for each test case, it reads `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2). For each test case, the function prints `n` if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1; otherwise, it prints 1. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that the specified number of test cases have been processed and the appropriate outputs have been printed for each.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` islands, and initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge.
   - Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges to minimize the number of islands that Everule can visit.
   - We need to find the minimum number of islands (including island 1) that Everule can visit after Dominater optimally destroys the bridges.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `k` is 0, no bridges are destroyed, and Everule can visit all `n` islands.
   - If `k` is large enough to disconnect island 1 from all other islands, Everule can only visit island 1.
   - The critical point is when `k` is such that it can disconnect island 1 from some but not all other islands.

3. **Optimal Strategy for Dominater:**
   - To minimize the number of islands Everule can visit, Dominater should focus on disconnecting island 1 from as many other islands as possible.
   - If `k` is less than `n-1`, Dominater can disconnect island 1 from `k` other islands, leaving `n - k` islands that Everule can still visit.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands, leaving only island 1 accessible to Everule.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then prints `n` if `n - k <= 1` (which means `k` is large enough to disconnect island 1 from all other islands), otherwise, it prints `1`.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The condition `n - k <= 1` is incorrect. It should be `k >= n - 1` to check if Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands.
   - The correct logic should be:
     - If `k >= n - 1`, print `1` (Everule can only visit island 1).
     - Otherwise, print `n - k` (Everule can visit `n - k` islands).

### Conclusion:
The given program has a logical error in the condition used to determine the number of islands Everule can visit. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
