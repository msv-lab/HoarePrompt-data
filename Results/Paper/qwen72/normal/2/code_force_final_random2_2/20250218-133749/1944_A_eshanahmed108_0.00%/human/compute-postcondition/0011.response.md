The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it is clear that the function should accept parameters related to `t`, `n`, and `k`. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases (`t`), where for each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `k`. The constraints are that `t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2.

The output of the function is not specified in the problem statement, so we cannot determine the exact return value without additional context. However, based on the typical structure of such functions, it is likely that the function processes each test case and returns some result based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `k` is an integer (0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2). The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
