The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, each involving two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function should process these inputs and produce an appropriate output for each test case.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `a` and `b` are integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

The function likely processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Since the specific output is not detailed, we can infer that the function might return some form of comparison or calculation based on the values of `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `a` and `b`.**
