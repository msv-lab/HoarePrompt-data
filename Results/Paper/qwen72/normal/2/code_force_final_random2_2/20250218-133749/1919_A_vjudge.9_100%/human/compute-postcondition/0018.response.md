Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is `t`, `a` and `b` are integers input by the user. The loop has completed all `t` iterations, and for each iteration, if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` was even, "Bob" was printed; otherwise, "Alice" was printed.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains the same as it was initially set by the user.
- The loop variable `i` has reached the value `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- For each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` were read from the user, and based on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` was even or odd, either "Bob" or "Alice" was printed, respectively.
