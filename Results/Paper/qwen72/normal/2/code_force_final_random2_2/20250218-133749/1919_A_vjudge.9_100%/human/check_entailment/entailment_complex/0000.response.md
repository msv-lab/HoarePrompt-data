Reasoning:  
To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify if the logic implemented in the function matches the rules of the game and produces the correct output for all possible inputs within the given constraints.

1. **Game Rules and Logic**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or keep their own.
   - Each player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
   - The key observation is that the game is symmetric and the outcome depends on the parity (even or odd) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b` in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic of checking the parity of the absolute difference is correct because:
     - If the difference is even, the game will end in a draw or Bob will win because the number of moves required to reach a state where one player cannot move will be even.
     - If the difference is odd, Alice will always have the last move and thus win.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - When `a` and `b` are equal, the difference is zero (even), and Bob wins.
     - When `a` and `b` are different by 1, the difference is odd, and Alice wins.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and produces the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
