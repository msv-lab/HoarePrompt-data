Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `i` is 1.
- `a` and `b` are integers input by the user.
- If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the condition is met.
- Otherwise, the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Alice**
