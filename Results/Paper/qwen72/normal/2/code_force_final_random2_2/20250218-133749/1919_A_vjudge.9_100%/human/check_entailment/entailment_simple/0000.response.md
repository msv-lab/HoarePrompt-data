Reasoning:  
To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented matches the rules of the game and the expected outcomes.

1. **Game Rules and Logic**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their own, followed by removing one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game essentially reduces to a parity problem. The key observation is that the player who starts with the wallet having more coins will always be able to force the other player into a losing position if the difference in the number of coins is odd.
   - If the difference in the number of coins is even, the player who starts (Alice) will eventually be forced into a losing position because the opponent can always mirror the moves.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b` for Alice and Bob, respectively.
   - It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For the test case `(1, 1)`: The difference is `0` (even), so Bob wins.
   - For the test case `(1, 4)`: The difference is `3` (odd), so Alice wins.
   - For the test case `(5, 3)`: The difference is `2` (even), so Bob wins.
   - For the test case `(4, 5)`: The difference is `1` (odd), so Alice wins.
   - These match the expected outcomes provided in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner based on the game rules and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
