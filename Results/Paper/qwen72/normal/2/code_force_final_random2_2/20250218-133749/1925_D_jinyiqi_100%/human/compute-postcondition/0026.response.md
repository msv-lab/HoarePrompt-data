Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is 0, `j` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the new input integers read from the input during the current iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.** 

The values of `a`, `b`, and `f` are updated to the new input integers read from the input during the current iteration. All other variables remain unchanged.
