Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is `new_n`, `m` is `new_m`, `k` is `new_k`, `sum_f` is `sum_f + total_f`, `j` is `m-1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration, `cn2` is `new_n * (new_n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * new_k * cn2 * (sum_f + total_f) + new_m * new_k * (new_k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (new_n * (new_n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.** 

Explanation: The value of `cn2` is updated to `new_n * (new_n - 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
