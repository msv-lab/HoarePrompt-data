The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `m` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2, and `m` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` must be greater than 2, `k` are input integers, `sum_f` is `f + f`, `j` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input.**
