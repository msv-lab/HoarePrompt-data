Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is `new_n`, `m` is `new_m` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `new_k`, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `j` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.** 

Explanation: The variables `a`, `b`, and `f` are updated to the new input integers read from the input during this iteration. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions.
