Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` must be greater than 1, `k` are input integers, `sum_f` is `f + f`, `j` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input.**

Explanation: The code `sum_f += f` adds the value of `f` to the current value of `sum_f`. Since `sum_f` was initially `f`, after executing this line, `sum_f` becomes `f + f`. All other variables remain unchanged.
