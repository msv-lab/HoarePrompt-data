### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 for each excursion they are chosen.
   - The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with the number of children \(n\), the number of friend pairs \(m\), and the number of excursions \(k\).
   - For each friend pair, we are given the indices of the children and their initial friendship value.

3. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - The total number of possible pairs of children is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - The probability of choosing a specific pair of friends is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The expected increase in the friendship value for a specific pair of friends over \(k\) excursions is \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The total expected value is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase for each pair.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
   - It calculates the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs.
   - It computes the total number of possible pairs \(\binom{n}{2}\).
   - It calculates the numerator \(p\) and the denominator \(q\) for the expected value.
   - It simplifies the fraction by dividing both \(p\) and \(q\) by their greatest common divisor (gcd).
   - It computes the modular inverse of \(q\) and multiplies it by \(p\) to get the final result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.
   - The mathematical formulation and the logic for calculating the expected value are correct.
   - The use of the modular inverse and the gcd to simplify the fraction is appropriate.

However, there is a potential issue in the calculation of the numerator \(p\):

- The formula used in the program is:
  \[
  p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \sum f_i + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
  \]
- This formula seems to be incorrect. The correct formula should be:
  \[
  p = k \cdot \sum f_i + \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2}
  \]

The term \(2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \sum f_i\) is not correct because it overcounts the contribution of the initial friendship values. The correct term should be \(k \cdot \sum f_i\), which represents the initial friendship values multiplied by the number of excursions.

### Corrected Formula:
- The correct numerator \(p\) should be:
  \[
  p = k \cdot \sum f_i + \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2}
  \]

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the incorrect formula used for the numerator \(p\). The correct formula should be used to ensure the program produces the correct results.

Final: **False**
