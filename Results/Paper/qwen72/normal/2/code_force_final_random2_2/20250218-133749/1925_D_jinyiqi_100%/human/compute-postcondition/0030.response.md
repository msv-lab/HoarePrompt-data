The code snippet `sum_f += f` updates the value of `sum_f` by adding the value of `f` to its current value.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` must be greater than 1
- `k` is an input integer
- `sum_f` is `sum_f + f` (initially, `sum_f` is already defined as `sum_f + f`)
- `j` is 1
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `f` is an input integer
- `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`
- `q` is `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd`
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`

After executing the code snippet:
- `sum_f` is updated to `sum_f + f`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `j` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * (sum_f + f) + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
