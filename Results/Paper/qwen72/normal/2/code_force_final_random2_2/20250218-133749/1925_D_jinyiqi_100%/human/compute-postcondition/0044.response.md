The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This will overwrite the previous values of these variables. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `sum_f`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd`) remain unchanged.

Let's assume the input values for `n`, `m`, and `k` are `new_n`, `new_m`, and `new_k` respectively. 

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is `new_n`, `m` is `new_m`, `k` is `new_k`, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations, `j` is `m-1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
