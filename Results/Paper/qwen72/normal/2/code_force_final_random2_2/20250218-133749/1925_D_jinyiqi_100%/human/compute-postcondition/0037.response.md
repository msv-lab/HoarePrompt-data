The code snippet `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2` updates the value of `q` based on the current value of `cn2`. Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` must be greater than 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `m` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations
   - `j` is `m-1`
   - `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration
   - `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
   - `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
   - `q` is `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd`
   - `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The new value of `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`.
   - `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.

3. **Updated Value**:
   - `q` is now `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2`.

4. **Output State**:
   - All other variables remain unchanged.
   - The updated value of `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations, `j` is `m-1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
