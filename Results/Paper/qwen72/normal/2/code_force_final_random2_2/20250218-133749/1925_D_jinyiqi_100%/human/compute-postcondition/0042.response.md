To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations.
- `j` is `m - 1`.
- `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration.
- `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`.
- `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`.
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `cn2`:**
   \[
   \text{cn2} = \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}
   \]

2. **Calculate `p`:**
   \[
   \text{p} = \frac{2 \times k \times \text{cn2} \times \text{sum_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1)}{\text{gcd}}
   \]

3. **Calculate `q`:**
   \[
   \text{q} = \frac{2 \times \text{cn2}}{\text{gcd}}
   \]

4. **Calculate `gcd`:**
   \[
   \text{gcd} = \text{greatest common divisor of } p \text{ and } q
   \]

5. **Compute the modular inverse of `q` modulo `M`:**
   \[
   \text{modular\_inverse} = \text{pow}(q, -1, M)
   \]

6. **Compute the final result:**
   \[
   \text{result} = (\text{p} \times \text{modular\_inverse}) \% M
   \]

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the above computation, which is the value of `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `sum_f` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value. However, the output will be the result of the modular arithmetic operation described.

Output: **int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) (where p and q are computed as described above, and M is a constant used for modular arithmetic)**
