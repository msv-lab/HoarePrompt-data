Postcondition: ***t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, a, b, and c are integers where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, i is 1, x is a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), y is a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), z is a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), and the current value of x is less than the current value of y. If y > z, res is 'peak'. If y < z, res is 'stair'. If y == z, res is 'none'.***
