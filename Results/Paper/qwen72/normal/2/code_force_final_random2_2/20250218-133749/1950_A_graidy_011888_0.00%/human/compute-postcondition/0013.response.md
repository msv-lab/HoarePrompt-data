Output State: **t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, a, b, and c are integers where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, i is 1, x is a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), y is a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), z is a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), res is 'none', the current value of x is less than the current value of y, and y is equal to z.**

The variable `res` is updated to the string 'none'. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
