Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is greater than `x`. According to the problem description, `n` can be equal to `x`, but the program's logic assumes that `n` is always less than or equal to `x // i`. This assumption can lead to incorrect results when `n` is greater than `x`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
10 11
```
In this case, the program will output `0`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1`, as the only way to split `10` into `11` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with a difficulty of `1`, making the GCD `1`.
