Functionality: ** The function reads two integers, `x` and `n`, from the input. It then calculates and prints the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the maximum quotient of `x` divided by a divisor that is less than or equal to `n`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `x` and `n` remain unchanged, and the program state includes the printed result. **
