Postcondition: ***`t` remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` remains the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` remains the second integer from the input, `i` is now 2, and the condition for the loop to continue is that `i` (which is now 2) must be less than `isqrt(x) + 1`. If `x % i == 0`, and `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 2. Otherwise, if `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // 2`. If `x % i != 0`, `ans` remains unchanged.***
