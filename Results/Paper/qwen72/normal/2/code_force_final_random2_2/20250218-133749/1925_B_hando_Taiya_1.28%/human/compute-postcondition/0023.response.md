Postcondition: ***`t` remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` remains the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` remains the second integer from the input, and `i` is 3. If `x % i == 0`, and `n` <= `x // i`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 3, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `isqrt(x) + 1`. If `x % i == 0`, and `n` > `x // i`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // 3`, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `isqrt(x) + 1`. If `x % i != 0`, the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `isqrt(x) + 1` without updating `ans`.***
