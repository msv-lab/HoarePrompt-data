The function `func_1` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, we can infer that the function likely accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`.

- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8.
- `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x.

Since the output of the function is not specified, we cannot determine the exact return value without additional context. However, we can describe the parameters the function accepts and leave the return value open-ended.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, and `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`. The function's return value is not specified.**
