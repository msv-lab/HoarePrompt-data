Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` remains the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` remains the second integer from the input, `i` is now 2, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 2, and the condition for the loop to continue is that `i` (which is now 2) must be less than `isqrt(x) + 1`.**
