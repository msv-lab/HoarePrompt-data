Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is an input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `_` is 0.
- `s2` is a shuffled version of `s`.
- `s` is equal to `s2`.

Given these conditions, the print statement is:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
