Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each iteration, `s` was a new input string (a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters). The variable `_` ranges from 0 to `t-1`, and for each iteration, `s2` is a shuffled version of the corresponding `s`. For each iteration, if `s` is not equal to `s2`, the condition `s != s2` held true, and "Yes" along with the shuffled string `s2` was printed. If `s` is equal to `s2`, the condition `s == s2` held true, and "No" was printed.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the loop has processed `t` input strings, each time generating a shuffled version of the string and checking if it is different from the original. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the conditions and outputs were determined based on whether the shuffled string was different from the original string.
