You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of up to 10 lowercase English letters. It then generates a random shuffle `s2` of the string `s`. If `s2` is different from `s`, it prints "Yes" followed by the shuffled string `s2`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints "No". The function does not return any value; it only performs these operations and prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect outputs in certain cases. Specifically, the program uses `random.sample` to shuffle the characters of the string `s`. While this approach can generate a different string most of the time, there is no guarantee that the generated string `s2` will always be different from `s`, especially for strings with repeated characters.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input string `s = "aaab"`. The program might generate the same string `s2 = "aaab"` due to the randomness in `random.sample`. In this case, the program will incorrectly print "No" instead of "Yes" followed by a valid rearranged string like "aaba".

### Example Input and Output:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  aaab
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  YES
  aaba
  ```
- **Actual Output (Potential):**
  ```
  NO
  ```

This demonstrates that the program does not always produce the correct output for every potential case, making it incorrect.
