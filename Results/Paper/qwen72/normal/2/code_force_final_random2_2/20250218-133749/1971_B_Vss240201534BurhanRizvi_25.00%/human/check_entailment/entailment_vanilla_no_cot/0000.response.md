Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the problem specification:

1. **Case Sensitivity**: The output should be "YES" or "NO" (case-insensitive), but the program outputs "Yes" and "No" with a capital 'Y' and 'N'. This might not be accepted by some automated judging systems.

2. **Randomness Issue**: The program uses `random.sample` to shuffle the string. While this approach can work, it relies on randomness, which means there's a small chance it might not produce a different string even though one exists. For example, if the string is "ab" and the random shuffle happens to return "ab" again, the program will incorrectly output "No".

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if the string consists of a single character (like "d"), the program will always output "No" because it's impossible to rearrange a single character to be different from itself. However, the problem specifies that the string length is at most 10, so this specific edge case is less likely to cause issues.

To fix these issues, a more deterministic approach should be used to ensure that the program always produces a valid output when possible. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(set(s)) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            # Swap the first two characters to ensure the string is different
            if s[0] == s[1]:
                s2 = list(s)
                for i in range(1, len(s)):
                    if s[i] != s[0]:
                        s2[0], s2[i] = s2[i], s2[0]
                        break
                s2 = ''.join(s2)
            else:
                s2 = s[1] + s[0] + s[2:]
            print(s2)

func()
```

This version ensures that:
- If all characters are the same, it outputs "NO".
- Otherwise, it swaps the first two characters (or finds a different character to swap with the first one) to ensure the resulting string is different from the original.
