Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is the new input string (a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters), `_` is 1, and `s2` is a shuffled version of the original `s`. If the new `s` is not equal to `s2`, the condition `s != s2` holds true. If the new `s` is equal to `s2`, the condition `s == s2` holds true.**
