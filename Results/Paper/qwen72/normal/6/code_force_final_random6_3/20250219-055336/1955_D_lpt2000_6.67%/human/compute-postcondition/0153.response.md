The value of `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of integers with a length greater than `m`, `in_aa` is the first element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element in `aa[:n - m]`, the value of `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, the value of `C[in_aa]` is not equal to the value of `D[in_aa]`, and `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**
