To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `nabors`. The loop will execute if `nabors` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is used to indicate that the loop index is not being used within the loop body.

Given the initial state:
- The function takes parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` with the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- It also takes two lists `a` and `b` with the constraints that `a` has `n` elements and `b` has `m` elements, and each element in `a` and `b` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6.
- `nabors` is an input integer.

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `nabors`. Specifically, `nabors` must be greater than 0.

State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0**
