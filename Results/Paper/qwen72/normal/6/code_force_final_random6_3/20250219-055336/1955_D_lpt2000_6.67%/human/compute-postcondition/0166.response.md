Output State: **`n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of integers with a length greater than `m + 1`, `in_aa` is the second element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the second element in `aa[:n - m]`, `tot` is the sum of all values in `D`, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `out_aa` is the second element in the sublist `aa[:n - m]`.
- The code `E[out_aa] -= 1` decreases the value of `E[out_aa]` by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
