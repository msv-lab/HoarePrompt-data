Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and `m` and `n` are the maximum and minimum values between `a[2]` and `b[2]` (considering ASCII values for comparison). If `i` is less than or equal to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, then `a[1]` is the larger of the original `a[1]` and `b[1]`, and `b[1]` is the smaller of the original `a[1]` and `b[1]`. Additionally, `a[2]` is set to `m` and `b[2]` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `a[1]` is the minimum value between the original `a[1]` and `b[1]`, and `b[1]` is the maximum value between the original `a[1]` and `b[1]`. Additionally, `a[2]` is set to `n` and `b[2]` is set to `m`.***
