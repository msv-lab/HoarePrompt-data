Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. `a` is a list of characters from the input string, `b` is a list of characters from the input string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
        n = min(a[i], b[i])
        m = max(a[i], b[i])
        a[i] = m
        b[i] = n
    else:
        n = min(a[i], b[i])
        m = max(a[i], b[i])
        a[i] = n
        b[i] = m


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus 1, `n` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `m` is the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `a[0]` is updated to `m`, and `b[0]` is updated to `n`. If `i` is greater than half the length of `a` minus 1, `n` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `m` is the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `a[0]` is updated to `n`, and `b[0]` is updated to `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If `i` is less than or equal to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, then `a[1]` is the larger of the original `a[1]` and `b[1]` (considering ASCII values for comparison), and `b[1]` is the smaller of the original `a[1]` and `b[1]`. Otherwise, `a[1]` is the minimum value between the original `a[1]` and `b[1]`, and `b[1]` is the maximum value between the original `a[1]` and `b[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and `m` and `n` are the maximum and minimum values between `a[2]` and `b[2]` (considering ASCII values for comparison). If `i` is less than or equal to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, then `a[1]` is the larger of the original `a[1]` and `b[1]`, and `b[1]` is the smaller of the original `a[1]` and `b[1]`. Additionally, `a[2]` is set to `m` and `b[2]` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `a[1]` is the minimum value between the original `a[1]` and `b[1]`, and `b[1]` is the maximum value between the original `a[1]` and `b[1]`. Additionally, `a[2]` is set to `n` and `b[2]` is set to `m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
