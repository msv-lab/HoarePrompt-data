The function `func_1` reads two strings `a` and `b` from the user, where each string represents an integer of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9. It then modifies `a` and `b` such that the first half of `a` contains the maximum values and the first half of `b` contains the minimum values of the corresponding elements from the original `a` and `b`. Conversely, the second half of `a` contains the minimum values and the second half of `b` contains the maximum values of the corresponding elements from the original `a` and `b`. After the modifications, the function prints the modified `a` and `b` as strings, each followed by a newline. The function does not return any value.
