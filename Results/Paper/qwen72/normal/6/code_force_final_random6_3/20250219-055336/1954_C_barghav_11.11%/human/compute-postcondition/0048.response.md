Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are lists of characters.
- The first half of `a` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
- The first half of `b` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
- The second half of `a` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
- The second half of `b` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
- `b` must have at least 3 elements.
- `i` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[i], end='')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `b` Structure**:
   - Since `b` must have at least 3 elements, we can assume `b` has a length of at least 3.
   - The first half of `b` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
   - The second half of `b` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.

2. **Index `i`**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - Since `b` has at least 3 elements, `b[2]` is within the bounds of the list.

3. **Value at `b[2]`**:
   - `b[2]` is in the second half of the list `b`.
   - According to the initial state, the second half of `b` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
- The `print(b[i], end='')` statement will print the character at index 2 of the list `b`.
- Since `i` is 2, and `b[2]` is in the second half of `b`, it will print the maximum value between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.

### Final Output:
Output: **b[2] (where b[2] is the maximum value between the corresponding elements of the original a and b at the second half of the list b)**
