Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are lists of characters.
- The first half of `a` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
- The first half of `b` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
- The second half of `a` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
- The second half of `b` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
- `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`.

### Print Statement:
```
print()
```

### Analysis:
- The `print()` statement is called without any arguments.
- When `print()` is called without any arguments, it simply prints a newline.

### Output:
Output: **(a newline)**

This means that the print statement will output a blank line.
