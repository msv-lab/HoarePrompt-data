Output State: **`a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus 1, `n` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `m` is the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `a[0]` is now `m`, `b[0]` is now `n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b[i]` is updated to `n`.
- Since `i` is 0, `b[0]` is now `n`.
- The values of `a`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `a[0]` remain the same as in the initial state.
- `a[0]` is still `m`, which is the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]` from the initial state.
- `b[0]` is now `n`, which is the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]` from the initial state.
