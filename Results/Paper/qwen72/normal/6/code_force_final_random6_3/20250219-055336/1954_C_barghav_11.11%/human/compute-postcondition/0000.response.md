Output State: **The function should take two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. `a` is a list of characters from the input string.**
