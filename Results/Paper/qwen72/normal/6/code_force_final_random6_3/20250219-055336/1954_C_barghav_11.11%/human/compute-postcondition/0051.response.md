The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. The function also processes a number of test cases, `t`, which is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, the function returns the result of comparing `x` and `y` in some way, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.
