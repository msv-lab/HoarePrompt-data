Output State: **`a` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `m` is the maximum value between `a[2]` and `b[2]`, `n` is the minimum value between `a[2]` and `b[2]`. If `i` is less than or equal to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, then `a[1]` is the larger of the original `a[1]` and `b[1]`, and `b[1]` is the smaller of the original `a[1]` and `b[1]`. Otherwise, `a[1]` is the minimum value between the original `a[1]` and `b[1]`, and `b[1]` is the maximum value between the original `a[1]` and `b[1]`.**
