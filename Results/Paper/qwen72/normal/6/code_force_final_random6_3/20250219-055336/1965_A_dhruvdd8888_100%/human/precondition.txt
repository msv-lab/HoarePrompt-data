The function `sol` is expected to read input from stdin and process multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The total number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is provided at the beginning of the input, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
