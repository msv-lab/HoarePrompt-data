Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0, `ls` is now `nums[0] + nums[1] - nums[0] + nums[2] - nums[1]`, `i` is 2, `nums[0]` is the same as before, `len(nums)` is at least 2, `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - nums[0]`, and `nums[2]` is now `nums[2] - nums[1]`.**

Explanation:
- `ls` was initially `nums[0] + nums[1] - nums[0]`, which simplifies to `nums[1]`.
- The code `ls += nums[i]` adds `nums[2]` to `ls`.
- Since `nums[2]` has been updated to `nums[2] - nums[1]`, the new value of `ls` is `nums[1] + (nums[2] - nums[1])`, which simplifies to `nums[2]`.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
