Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has at least 3 elements, each element in `nums` is now 0, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums` before the loop, `i` is `len(nums) - 3`, `nw` is the same as `cw`, and `cw` is True.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `cw = True` sets the variable `cw` to `True`.
- The initial state indicates that `cw` was previously True if `nums[i]` was not 1, and False if `nums[i]` was 1. However, since the code snippet explicitly sets `cw` to `True`, the value of `cw` is now `True` regardless of the previous value of `nums[i]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
