Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples.
   - `N` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has at least 3 elements.
   - Each element in `nums` is now 0.
   - `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums` before the loop.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `nw` is the same as the last value of `cw`.
   - `cw` is False.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('Bob')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement is simply printing a string literal `'Bob'`.
   - The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this print statement because the statement does not reference any of them.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the print statement will be the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
