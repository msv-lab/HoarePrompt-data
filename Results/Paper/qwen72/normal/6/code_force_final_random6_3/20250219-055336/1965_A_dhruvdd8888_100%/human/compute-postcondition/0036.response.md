Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples.
   - `N` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has at least 3 elements.
   - Each element in `nums` is now 0.
   - `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums` before the loop.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `nw` is the same as the last value of `cw`.
   - `cw` is True.
   - `nums[1]` is not equal to 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Alice')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string 'Alice'.
   - The initial state provides information about various variables and objects, but none of these are used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string 'Alice'.

4. **Output:**
   Output: **Alice**
