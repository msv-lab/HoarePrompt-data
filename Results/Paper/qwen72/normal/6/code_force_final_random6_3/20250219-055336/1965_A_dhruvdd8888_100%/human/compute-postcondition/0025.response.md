Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has at least 3 elements, each element in `nums` is now 0, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums` before the loop, `i` is `len(nums) - 3`, `nw` is the same as the previous value of `cw`, and `cw` is now the opposite of the previous value of `nw`. If `nums[i]` is 1, `cw` is False. Otherwise, `cw` remains True and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1.**
