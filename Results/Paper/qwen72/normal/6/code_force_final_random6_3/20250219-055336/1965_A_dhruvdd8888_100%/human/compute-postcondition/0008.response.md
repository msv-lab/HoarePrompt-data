The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `nums`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `len(nums)` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `len(nums)` must still be at least 1.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0, `ls` is now `nums[0]`, `i` is 1, `nums[0]` is the same as before, `len(nums)` is at least 1.**
