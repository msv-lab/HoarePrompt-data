Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0, `ls` is now `nums[0] + nums[1] - nums[0]`, `i` is 1, `nums[0]` is the same as before, `len(nums)` is at least 1, and `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - nums[0]`.**

In natural language: The variable `ls` is updated to be the sum of `nums[0]` and `nums[1] - nums[0]`, which simplifies to `nums[1]`. The variable `i` remains 1, and the list `nums` remains sorted with `nums[0]` unchanged and `nums[1]` being `nums[1] - nums[0]`. The length of `nums` is still at least 1, and `test_cases` and `N` remain unchanged.
