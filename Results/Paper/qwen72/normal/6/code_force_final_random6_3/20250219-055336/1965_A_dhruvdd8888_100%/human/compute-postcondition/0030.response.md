Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has at least 4 elements, each element in `nums` is now 0, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums` before the loop, `i` is `len(nums) - 4`, `nw` is the same as the previous value of `cw`. If `nums[i]` is 1, `cw` is False. Otherwise, `cw` is True and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cw` is updated to be the logical negation of `nw`.
- If `nw` was previously True, `cw` is now False.
- If `nw` was previously False, `cw` is now True.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `N`, `nums`, `ls`, `i`) remain unchanged.
