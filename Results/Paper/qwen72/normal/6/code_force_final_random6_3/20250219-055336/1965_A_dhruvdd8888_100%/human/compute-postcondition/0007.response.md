Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0, `ls` is now `nums[0]`, `i` is 0, `nums[0]` is the same as before, `len(nums)` is at least 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ls += nums[i]` updates the value of `ls` by adding the value of `nums[0]` to it. Since `i` is 0, `nums[i]` is `nums[0]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
