Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than 0, `suma` is `a`, `x` is `a`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `x` is \((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1\), which simplifies to \(a // 1 = a\).
- The value of `suma` is incremented by `x`, so `suma` becomes \(0 + a = a\).
- The values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The expression \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\) is not evaluated because `i` is not defined in the given code snippet.
