### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \).
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \( 1 \le a \le n \)
     - \( 1 \le b \le m \)
     - \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - For \( a + b \) to be a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \), it must be that \( a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) for some integer \( k \).
   - This implies \( \frac{a + b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \) must be an integer.
   - Simplifying, \( \frac{a}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} + \frac{b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} = \frac{a}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} + \frac{1}{\gcd(a, b)} \) must be an integer.
   - This further simplifies to \( \frac{a}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \) being an integer minus \( \frac{1}{\gcd(a, b)} \).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over all possible values of \( b \) from 1 to \( m \).
   - For each \( b \), it calculates \( x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1 \).
   - It then checks if \( x \) is positive and adds it to the sum.
   - Additionally, it checks if \( a - i \cdot (i - 1) \) and \( i \cdot (i - 1) \) are both multiples of \( i^2 \) and adds 1 to the sum if true.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The formula \( x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1 \) is derived from the condition \( a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \), but it is not a correct transformation.
   - The condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) should be checked directly.
   - The program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly capture the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
   - The additional check \( (a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0 \) and \( i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0 \) is also incorrect and unnecessary.

5. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The formula and the additional checks do not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The program subtracts 2 from the final sum, which is not justified by the problem statement.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
