Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings from the new input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and `x` is \((a - 2 \times 1) // 4 + 1\)**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `x` was \((a - 1) // 1 + 1\), which simplifies to \(a\).
- The code snippet updates `x` to \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
- Given `i` is 2, the expression becomes \((a - 2 \times 1) // 4 + 1\), which simplifies to \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\).
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
