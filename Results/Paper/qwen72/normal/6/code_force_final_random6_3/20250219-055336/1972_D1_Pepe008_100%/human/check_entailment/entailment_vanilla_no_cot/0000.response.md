Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to solve the problem but has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`**:
   - The formula used to calculate `x` is incorrect. The program uses:
     ```python
     x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
     ```
   - This formula does not correctly determine the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

2. **Incorrect Condition for Adding to `suma`**:
   - The program adds `x` to `suma` if `x` is greater than 0, but then it also has an additional condition:
     ```python
     if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
         suma += 1
     ```
   - This condition is not necessary and does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Incorrect Final Output**:
   - The program subtracts 2 from `suma` before printing:
     ```python
     print(suma - 2)
     ```
   - This subtraction is not justified by the problem statement and can lead to incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\) holds. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    return math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        suma = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **gcd Function**: The `gcd` function is used to compute the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.
- **Nested Loops**: The program iterates through all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges.
- **Condition Check**: For each pair `(a, b)`, it checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- **Summation**: If the condition is satisfied, it increments `suma`.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the total count of valid pairs for each test case.

This corrected approach ensures that the program correctly counts the number of valid pairs for each test case.
