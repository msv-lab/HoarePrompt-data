The code snippet `info = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is then assigned to the variable `info`. This operation overwrites the initial value of `info`, which was a list of strings from the input, with a new list of strings derived from the current input.

The values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `suma` remain unchanged, but the new value of `info` will be used for any subsequent operations that depend on it.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings from the new input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in the initial `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in the initial `info` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is the sum of the values of \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for each `i` from 1 to `b` where \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\), and an additional 1 is added to `suma` for each `i` where \((a - i \times (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0\) and \(i \times (i - 1) % i^2 == 0\)**
