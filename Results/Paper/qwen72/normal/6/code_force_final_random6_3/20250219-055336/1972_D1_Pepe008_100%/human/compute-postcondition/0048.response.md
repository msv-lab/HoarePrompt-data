Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `x` is \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\), `i` is 2, `suma` is increased by \((a - 2) // 4 + 2\).**

Explanation:
- The value of `suma` is incremented by 1.
- The initial value of `suma` was \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\).
- After the increment, `suma` becomes \((a - 2) // 4 + 1 + 1\), which simplifies to \((a - 2) // 4 + 2\).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
