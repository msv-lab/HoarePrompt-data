You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \).
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \( 1 \le a \le n \)
     - \( 1 \le b \le m \)
     - \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - For \( a + b \) to be a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \), it must be that \( a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) for some integer \( k \).
   - This implies \( \frac{a + b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \) must be an integer.
   - Simplifying, \( \frac{a}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} + \frac{b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} = \frac{a}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} + \frac{1}{\gcd(a, b)} \) must be an integer.
   - This further simplifies to \( \frac{a}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \) being an integer minus \( \frac{1}{\gcd(a, b)} \).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over all possible values of \( b \) from 1 to \( m \).
   - For each \( b \), it calculates \( x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1 \).
   - It then checks if \( x \) is positive and adds it to the sum.
   - Additionally, it checks if \( a - i \cdot (i - 1) \) and \( i \cdot (i - 1) \) are both multiples of \( i^2 \) and adds 1 to the sum if true.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The formula \( x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1 \) is derived from the condition \( a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
   - However, the formula and the additional checks do not correctly capture the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
   - The program seems to be attempting to count the number of valid \( a \) for each \( b \), but the logic is flawed.

5. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is not correctly checked.
   - The formula \( x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1 \) does not directly relate to the problem's condition.
   - The additional check \( (a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0 \) and \( i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0 \) is also incorrect and unnecessary.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.
