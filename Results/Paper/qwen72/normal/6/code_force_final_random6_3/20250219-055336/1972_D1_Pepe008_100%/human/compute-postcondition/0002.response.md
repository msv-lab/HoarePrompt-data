The code snippet `info = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variable `info` is now a list containing the split input. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, and `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings from the input.**
