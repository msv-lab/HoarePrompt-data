Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\), `suma` is `suma + x`. If \((a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0\), then `suma` is `suma + x + 1`.**
