Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`, and `x` is \(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\).**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is calculated as \(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\).
- The values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`.
- The loop condition \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i\) must still hold for the loop to continue.
