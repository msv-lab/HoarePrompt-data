Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is 0, `x` is the result of the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` where `i` is an unknown positive integer.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is computed using the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
- The variables `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `suma` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so it is treated as an unknown positive integer.
- The result of the expression is assigned to `x`.
