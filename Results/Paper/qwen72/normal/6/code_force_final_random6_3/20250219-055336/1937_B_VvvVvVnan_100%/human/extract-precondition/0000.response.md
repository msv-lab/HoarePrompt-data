Precondition: **The function should accept three parameters: the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and two binary strings a1 and a2 of length n, where each character in a1 and a2 is either '0' or '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and two binary strings `a1` and `a2`.
