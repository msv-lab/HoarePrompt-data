Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `i` is 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is `3 * f`, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `m` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is incremented by `f`. Initially, `a` was `2 * f`, so after the increment, `a` becomes `3 * f`.
- All other variables (`M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `f`, `c`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `m` must be greater than 2 still holds.
