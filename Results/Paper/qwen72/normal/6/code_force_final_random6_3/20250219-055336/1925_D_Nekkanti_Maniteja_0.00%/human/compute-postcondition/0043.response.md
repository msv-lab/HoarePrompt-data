Output State: **`s` is updated to `c * c * m * i + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1, `m` is a new integer greater than or equal to 3, `u` is the last integer value from the input, `v` is the last integer value from the input, `f` is the last integer value from the input, `a` is equal to the sum of all `f` values from the input, `n` is assigned a new integer value from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.**

In natural language: The value of `s` is updated by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its previous value. The previous value of `s` was `c * c * m * i + c * a`, so the new value of `s` is `c * c * m * i + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
