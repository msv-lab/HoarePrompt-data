Output State: **`s` is 0, `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `u` is an integer value from the input, `v` is an integer value from the input, `f` is an integer value from the input, `a` is 0, `k < int(input())`, `n` is assigned an integer value from the input, `m` is assigned a new integer value from the input, `k` is assigned a new integer value from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`**

Explanation:
- The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` assigns integer values from the input to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`.
- The initial values of `s`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `a`, `M`, and `c` remain unchanged.
- The condition `k < int(input())` and the assignments `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input are still valid.
- The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are now specific integers provided by the user input.
