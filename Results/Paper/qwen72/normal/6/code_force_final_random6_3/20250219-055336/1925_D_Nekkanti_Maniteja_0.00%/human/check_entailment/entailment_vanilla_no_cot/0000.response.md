Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Probability:**
   - The probability of choosing a friend pair is calculated as `c = pow(n * (n -1) // 1, -1, M)`. This is incorrect because the total number of possible pairs of children is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, not `n * (n - 1) // 1`. The correct calculation should be `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Incorrect Summation:**
   - The summation of the expected friendship values is done in a loop where `s` is updated as `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. This is incorrect because the expected value of the friendship value for each chosen pair should be calculated differently.
   - The correct approach is to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion and then sum these expected values over all k excursions.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs plus the expected number of times each friend pair is chosen. This can be simplified to a single formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values over all k excursions.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        if total_pairs == 0:
            print(0)
            continue
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % M
        expected_sum = (a * k + m * k * (k - 1) // 2 * c) % M
        print(expected_sum)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Total Pairs Calculation:**
   - `total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2` correctly calculates the total number of possible pairs of children.

2. **Probability Calculation:**
   - `c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)` correctly calculates the modular inverse of the total number of pairs, which is the probability of choosing any specific pair.

3. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - `a` is the sum of the initial friendship values of all friend pairs.

4. **Expected Sum Calculation:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion is `a * k` (the initial values summed over k excursions).
   - Additionally, each friend pair can be chosen multiple times, and each time it is chosen, its friendship value increases by 1. The expected number of times a specific friend pair is chosen is `k * c`, and the sum of the increases over all k excursions is `m * k * (k - 1) // 2 * c`.

5. **Output:**
   - The final expected sum is calculated and printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

This corrected program should now correctly solve the problem as described.
