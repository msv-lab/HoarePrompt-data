You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, for each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each of the next m lines contains three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        
        s = 0
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        
        print(s % M)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `t-1`, `t` is the total number of test cases, `n`, `m`, and `k` have been processed for each test case, `s` is the final accumulated value modulo `M` for each test case, `a` is the sum of all `f` values for each test case, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the last values read from the input for each test case, and `M` is 1000000007.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `k` with specific constraints and processes `m` lines of additional input. If the input parameters are invalid, it returns an error message. If the input parameters are valid, it processes the test cases and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
