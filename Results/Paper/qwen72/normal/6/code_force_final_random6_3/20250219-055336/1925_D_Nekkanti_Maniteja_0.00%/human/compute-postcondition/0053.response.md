Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned new integer values from the input, `s` is 0, `i` is `k`, `u` is the last integer value from the input, `v` is the last integer value from the input, `f` is the last integer value from the input, `a` is 0, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.**

The value of `a` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
