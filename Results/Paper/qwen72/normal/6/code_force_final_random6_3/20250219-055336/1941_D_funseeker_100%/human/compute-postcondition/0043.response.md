Postcondition: ***`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 1, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least three unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or at least three unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', otherwise `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n` and an additional value `(q + r) % n`, and `q` is the third element in `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', the value `(q + r) % n` has been added to `temp`.***
