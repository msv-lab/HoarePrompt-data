### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`, which in turn calls `func_1()` to read a line of input and converts it to an integer.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`, which splits a line of input and converts each part to an integer.
   - It then reads `m` lines of input, each containing a distance `r` and a direction `c` using `func_1().split()`.

2. **Set Initialization:**
   - The set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`.

3. **Loop for Throws:**
   - The program iterates `m` times, each time reading a throw distance `r` and direction `c`.
   - For each player in the current set `ans`, it calculates the new positions based on the direction:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`.
   - After processing all players in `ans`, it updates `ans` to be the set of new positions in `temp`.

4. **Handling Zero Position:**
   - If `0` is in the set `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to the set. This is because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and `0` should be treated as `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players in `ans` and then prints the sorted list of players.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Input Validation:**
  - The program correctly reads and processes the input as described in the problem statement.
  - It handles the constraints on `t`, `n`, `m`, and `x` appropriately.

- **Set Operations:**
  - The set operations are correctly implemented to account for both clockwise and counterclockwise throws.
  - The use of modulo `n` ensures that the positions wrap around the circle correctly.

- **Handling Zero Position:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the position is `0` by converting it to `n`.

- **Output:**
  - The program outputs the correct number of players and the sorted list of player numbers who could have the ball at the end of the game.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
