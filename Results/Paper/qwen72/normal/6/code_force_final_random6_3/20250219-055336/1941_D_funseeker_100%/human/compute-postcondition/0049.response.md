Output State: **`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is a set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', otherwise `temp` contains all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'**

Explanation:
- The code `r, c = func_1().split()` updates the values of `r` and `c`.
- `r` is now the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
- `c` is now the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, and `temp` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
- The new values of `r` and `c` are derived from the string returned by `func_1()`, and they replace the previous values in the initial state.
