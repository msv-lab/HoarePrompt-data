The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0. The value of `n`, `x`, and the set `ans` do not affect the execution of the loop, but they are part of the program state before the loop starts.

Since the loop is dependent on `m` and the loop will execute `m` times, for the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need an initial state since it is not used.

Given the constraints and the initial state, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing the value `x`**
