Output State: **`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is a set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', otherwise `temp` contains all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'**

Explanation: The code `r = int(r)` converts `r` from its previous type (which was likely a string) to an integer. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
