The code snippet `temp.add((q - r) % n)` modifies the set `temp` by adding a new value, which is the result of the expression `(q - r) % n`. The initial state specifies that `temp` is a set containing the value `(x + r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', and is otherwise an empty set. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing the value `x`, `r` is an integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is either '1' or '?'. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(x + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` is a set containing the value `(q - r) % n`.**
