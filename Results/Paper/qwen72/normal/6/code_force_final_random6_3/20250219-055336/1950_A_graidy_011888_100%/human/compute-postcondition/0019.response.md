The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits (integers) provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`. If `a < b and b > c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is greater than `c`. If none of these conditions hold, then `a`, `b`, and `c` do not satisfy `a < b < c` or `a < b and b > c`.**
