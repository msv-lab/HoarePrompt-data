Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if three given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither, based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case by reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair.
   - It checks if `a < b` and `b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output**: The program correctly outputs "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case based on the conditions.

The program handles all the given test cases correctly and produces the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct.
