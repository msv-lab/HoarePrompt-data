The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`.

- `a` is now a list of integers based on the new input.
- The value of `i` is no longer `len(a) - 1` because `a` has been redefined.
- The value of `t` remains greater than 0 but less than the original `t`.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer.
- The value of `res` is no longer the number of zeros in the list `a` because `a` has been redefined.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers based on the new input, `i` is undefined, `t` is greater than 0 but less than the original `t`, `n` is an input integer, `res` is undefined.**
