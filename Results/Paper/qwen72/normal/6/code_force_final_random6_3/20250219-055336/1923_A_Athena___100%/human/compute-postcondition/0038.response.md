The first element of the list `a` is removed. Since the first element was 0, the list `a` now starts with the second element from the initial state. The length of `a` is reduced by 1, so `i` is now `len(a) - 1` (which is one less than its previous value). The values of `t`, `res`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` is greater than 0, `res` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**
