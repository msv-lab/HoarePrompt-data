Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where there are multiple blocks of chips that can be moved to form a single block. The program only counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 0 1 0 1
```
The correct output should be `2` because you can move the first chip to the second position and the last chip to the fourth position, forming a single block of chips. However, the program will output `3` because it counts all the zeros between the first and last chip.

This shows that the program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case.
