The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `a`. The loop's continuation depends on whether `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `a` must still have at least one element left for the loop to continue.

Given that `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 at the start of the next iteration. The list `a` must have at least one element (i.e., its length must be greater than 0) for the loop to execute again.

State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `res` is 0, and `n` is an input integer. If the first element of `a` is 0, then `res` is 1.**
