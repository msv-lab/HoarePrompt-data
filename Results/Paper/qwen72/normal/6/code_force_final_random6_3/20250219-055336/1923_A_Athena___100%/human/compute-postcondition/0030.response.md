Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list where the last element is not 0.
   - `i` is `len(a) - 1`, which means `i` is the index of the last element in the list `a`.
   - `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet).
   - `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(res)
   ```

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`.
   - `res` is defined as the number of zeros in the list `a`.
   - Since the last element of `a` is not 0, the number of zeros in the list `a` is the count of zeros in all elements except the last one.

Therefore, the output will be the number of zeros in the list `a`.

Output: **res (where res is the number of zeros in the list `a`)**
