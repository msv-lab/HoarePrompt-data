Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and has at least one fewer trailing zero, `i` is undefined, `t` is greater than 0 but less than the original `t`, `n` is an input integer, `res` is 0**. 

The trailing zero from the list `a` has been removed, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged.
