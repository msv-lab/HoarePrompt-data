Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `[*open(0)][1:]` must have at least 1 element.
   - `s` is the first element in the list `[*open(0)][1:]`.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by whitespace.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second part of `s` split by whitespace.

2. **Understanding the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is: `print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))`.

3. **Breaking Down the Expression:**
   - `(k // 2 + k % 2)`: This computes the ceiling of `k / 2`. For example, if `k` is 5, `k // 2` is 2 and `k % 2` is 1, so the result is 3.
   - `(k < 4 * n - 3)`: This is a boolean condition that evaluates to 1 if true and 0 if false.
   - `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)`: This multiplies `2 * n` by the boolean condition `(k >= 4 * n - 3)`, which evaluates to 1 if true and 0 if false.
   - `(k == 4 * n - 2)`: This is another boolean condition that evaluates to 1 if true and 0 if false.

4. **Combining the Expressions:**
   - The expression is a combination of these terms:
     - `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3)`: This term is the ceiling of `k / 2` if `k < 4 * n - 3`, otherwise 0.
     - `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)`: This term is `2 * n` if `k >= 4 * n - 3`, otherwise 0.
     - `(k == 4 * n - 2)`: This term is 1 if `k == 4 * n - 2`, otherwise 0.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The final value printed is the sum of these three terms.

6. **Possible Values:**
   - If `k < 4 * n - 3`, the expression simplifies to `(k // 2 + k % 2)`.
   - If `k >= 4 * n - 3` and `k != 4 * n - 2`, the expression simplifies to `2 * n`.
   - If `k == 4 * n - 2`, the expression simplifies to `2 * n + 1`.

Given the initial state, the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, but we can describe the output based on the conditions:

Output: **(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2) (where n is the integer value of the first part of s split by whitespace, and k is the integer value of the second part of s split by whitespace)**

This output will be the result of the expression based on the values of `n` and `k` derived from the first element `s` of the list `[*open(0)][1:]`.
