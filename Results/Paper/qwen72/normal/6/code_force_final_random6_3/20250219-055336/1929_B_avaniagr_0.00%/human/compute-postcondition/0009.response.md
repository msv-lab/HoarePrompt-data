Output State: **`[*open(0)][1:]` is exhausted, and all elements in the list `[*open(0)][1:]` have been processed. For each processed element `s`, `n` and `k` were assigned the integer values of the first and second parts of `s` split by whitespace, respectively, and the corresponding calculation was printed.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the list `[*open(0)][1:]`, which means it starts from the second element of the list obtained from reading the input file (file descriptor 0).
- For each element `s` in this list, the values of `n` and `k` are determined by splitting `s` on whitespace and converting the resulting strings to integers.
- The loop body performs a calculation based on `n` and `k` and prints the result.
- After all iterations, the list `[*open(0)][1:]` is exhausted, meaning all elements have been processed, and the loop has completed its execution.
