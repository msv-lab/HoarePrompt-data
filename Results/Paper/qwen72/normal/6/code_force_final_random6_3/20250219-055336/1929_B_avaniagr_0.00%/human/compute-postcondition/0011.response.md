Functionality: ** The function reads lines from the standard input, skipping the first line. For each subsequent line, it splits the line into two integers `n` and `k`, and prints a calculated value based on these integers. The calculation is as follows: if `k` is less than `4 * n - 3`, the function prints `(k // 2 + k % 2)`, otherwise, it prints `2 * n` plus 1 if `k` equals `4 * n - 2`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input source is exhausted, and the calculations for all lines have been printed. **
