### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total, which include both the main diagonals and the anti-diagonals.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Each cell in the grid can be part of up to 4 diagonals (2 main and 2 anti-diagonals).
   - To minimize the number of colored cells, we should try to maximize the number of diagonals each colored cell can cover.

3. **Solution Breakdown**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it parses the values of \( n \) and \( k \).
   - The formula used to determine the minimum number of cells to color is:
     \[
     \text{result} = (k // 2 + k \% 2) \times (k < 4n - 3) + 2n \times (k >= 4n - 3) + (k == 4n - 2)
     \]

4. **Formula Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: \( k < 4n - 3 \)**:
     - Here, \( k \) is less than the total number of diagonals minus one.
     - The formula \( k // 2 + k \% 2 \) calculates the ceiling of \( k / 2 \). This is because each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals, and if \( k \) is odd, we need one extra cell to cover the remaining diagonal.
   - **Case 2: \( k \geq 4n - 3 \)**:
     - Here, \( k \) is close to or equal to the total number of diagonals.
     - The formula \( 2n \) is used because if \( k \) is very close to the total number of diagonals, we need to color almost the entire grid to cover all diagonals.
   - **Case 3: \( k == 4n - 2 \)**:
     - This is a special case where \( k \) is exactly the total number of diagonals.
     - The formula adds 1 to the result, which is necessary because covering all \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals requires exactly \( 2n \) cells, plus one additional cell to ensure all diagonals are covered.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \) by adding 1 to the result.
   - It also handles the case where \( k \) is less than \( 4n - 3 \) by using the ceiling of \( k / 2 \).

6. **Input and Output**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - It correctly parses the input and prints the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum number of cells to color based on the problem description. The formula used is appropriate for the given constraints and edge cases.

### Correctness:
