Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1 if the first element of `num` is equal to the second element, otherwise `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `j` is 0. If the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
