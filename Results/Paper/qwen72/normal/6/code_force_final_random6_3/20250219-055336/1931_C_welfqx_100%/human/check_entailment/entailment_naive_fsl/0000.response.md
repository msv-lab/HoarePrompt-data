Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the array has multiple different values, and the optimal solution involves selecting a value that is not at the beginning or the end of the array. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

The correct output should be `3` because you can set the middle three elements to `2` (i.e., `i=2, j=4, x=2`), which would result in the array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` and then set the entire array to `2` (i.e., `i=1, j=5, x=2`), which would result in the array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. The total cost is `3` burles.

However, the given program will output `1`, which is incorrect. The program only considers the longest prefix and suffix of the same value, but it does not consider the optimal value that might be in the middle of the array.
