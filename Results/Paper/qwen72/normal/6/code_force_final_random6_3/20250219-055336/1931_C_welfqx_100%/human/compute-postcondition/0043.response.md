Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is the index where the first pair of consecutive elements differ (or `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking), `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 2. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 4. Otherwise, `cn` is 1 and `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`.***
