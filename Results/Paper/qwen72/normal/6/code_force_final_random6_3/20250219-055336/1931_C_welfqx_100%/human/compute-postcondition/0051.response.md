The only variables in the loop head are `ii` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `ii` and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`ii` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
