Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.** 

The value of `t` is updated to the integer input provided by the user, while the constraints and values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
