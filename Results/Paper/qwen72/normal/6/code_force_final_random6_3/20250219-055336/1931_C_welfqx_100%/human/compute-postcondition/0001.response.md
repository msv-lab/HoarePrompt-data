The only variables in the loop head are `r` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `r` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and `t` is already given as an input integer with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which ensures that the loop can execute at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1 and `r` is 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0**
