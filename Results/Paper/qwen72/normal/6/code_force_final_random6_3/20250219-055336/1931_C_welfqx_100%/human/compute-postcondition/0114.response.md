The only objects in the loop head are the variables `ii` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `ii` and the condition `ii < n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `ii` for the loop condition to hold true.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `ii` is incremented by 1, so `ii` is 1.
- `n` must still be greater than `ii + 1`, which means `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`ii` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2**
