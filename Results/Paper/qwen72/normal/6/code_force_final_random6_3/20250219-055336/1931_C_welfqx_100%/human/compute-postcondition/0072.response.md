Postcondition: ***`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `onum` that are equal, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `r` is `t`, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 0. If the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, `f` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
