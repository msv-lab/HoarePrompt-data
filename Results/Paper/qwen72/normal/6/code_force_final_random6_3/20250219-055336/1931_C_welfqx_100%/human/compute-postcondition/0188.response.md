Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `ii` is `n - 2`, and `ck` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `onum` up to the point where the elements differ, or `n - 1` if all elements from index 0 to `n - 2` are equal. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is updated to `cn + ck`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `ii`, `ck`, and `symb1` remain unchanged.***
