The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1. For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 1, but since `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2**
