Output State: **`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is `t`, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `j` is the index where the first pair of consecutive elements that are not equal was found, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 1, `cn` is 2 if `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, otherwise `cn` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The code `cn += 1` increments the value of `cn` by 1.
- If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` was initially 1 (as per the initial state), so after the increment, `cn` becomes 2.
- If `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` was initially 1 and the loop or if statement breaks, so `cn` remains 1.
- All other variables (`ii`, `ck`, `n`, `r`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
