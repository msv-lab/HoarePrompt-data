Postcondition: **`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `onum` that are equal, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `r` is `t`, `f` is 0 if any two consecutive elements in `num` are not equal, otherwise `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `j` is the index where the first pair of consecutive elements that are not equal was found. Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `f` is 1.**
