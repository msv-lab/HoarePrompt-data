Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment[0]` is `max_segment[0] + arr[1]`, `new_segment` is either an empty list or `[arr[1], 1]` based on the conditions described, `segments_variants` is updated with a new list that is `new_segment` plus `[1]`.**
