Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is updated based on the conditions described, `segments_variants` now includes the list `new_segment + [0]`, `max_segment` is equal to `new_segment`.**
