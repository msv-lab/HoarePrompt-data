The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `arr` being a list of integers with the specified range does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure `arr` has at least one element and `i` is 0.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1**
