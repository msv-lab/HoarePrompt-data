Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment[0]` is `max_segment[0] + arr[1]`. If `arr[2]` is non-negative, `new_segment` is `[arr[2], 2]` and `segments_variants` is updated based on the conditions described. If `arr[2]` is negative, `new_segment` and `segments_variants` remain unchanged.***
