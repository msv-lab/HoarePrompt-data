### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to maximize the sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where an operation consists of selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be output modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function correctly computes the remainder of `number` when divided by \(10^9 + 7\). This is essential for handling large numbers and ensuring the output is within the required range.

   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers. However, there are several issues:
       - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array contains all negative numbers. It should return 0 in such cases, but it does not.
       - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array contains a mix of positive and negative numbers. It should find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray, not just non-negative segments.
       - The function appends `new_segment` and `max_segment` to `segments_variants` even if they are empty or invalid, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic of the program is to use the result of `func_2` to determine the maximum segment sum and then compute the final answer using the formula:
     \[
     \text{answer} = \text{max\_segment}[0] \times 2^k + \sum(a) - \text{max\_segment}[0]
     \]
   - This formula is based on the idea that the maximum segment sum can be added `2^k` times to the array, and then the original sum of the array is adjusted by subtracting the maximum segment sum once.

4. **Issues:**
   - **Incorrect Handling of Negative Arrays:**
     - If `max_segment[0]` is -1, it is set to 0. This is incorrect because the maximum segment sum should be 0 if the array contains all negative numbers.
   - **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Segment Sum:**
     - The function `func_2` does not correctly find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray. It only considers non-negative segments, which is not the correct approach.
   - **Redundant Appends:**
     - The function `func_2` appends `new_segment` and `max_segment` to `segments_variants` even if they are empty or invalid, which can lead to incorrect results.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is to use Kadane's algorithm, which efficiently finds the maximum subarray sum in linear time.
   - After finding the maximum subarray sum, the formula should be applied correctly to compute the final answer.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the `func_2` function and the incorrect handling of negative arrays, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
