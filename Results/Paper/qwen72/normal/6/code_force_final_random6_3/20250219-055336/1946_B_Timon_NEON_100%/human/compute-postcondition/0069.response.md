The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `arr[i]` satisfies -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr). The function returns the segment in `segments_variants` with the highest sum, provided that the segment has more than one element. If no such segment is found, the function returns `[-1]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the segment with the highest sum from `segments_variants` if the segment has more than one element. If no such segment is found, it returns `[-1]`.**
