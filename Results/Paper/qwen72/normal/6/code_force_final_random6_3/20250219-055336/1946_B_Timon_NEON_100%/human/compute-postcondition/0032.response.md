Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment[0]` is `max_segment[0] + arr[1]`, `new_segment` is updated based on the conditions described, and `segments_variants` is updated based on the conditions described.**

Explanation:
- The value of `max_segment[0]` is updated by adding the value of `arr[1]` to it.
- The initial value of `arr[1]` is an integer within the range -10^9 to 10^9.
- The values of `arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` remain unchanged, except for the specific update to `max_segment[0]`.
