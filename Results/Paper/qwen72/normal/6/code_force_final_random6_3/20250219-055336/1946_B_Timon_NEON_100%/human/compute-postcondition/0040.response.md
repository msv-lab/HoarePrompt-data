Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment[0]` is `max_segment[0] + arr[1]`, `new_segment` is either an empty list or `[arr[1], 1]` based on the conditions, `segments_variants` is a list that includes the initial `max_segment` plus the value `[1]` at the end.**

Explanation:
- `segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])` appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list is `max_segment` with the value `[1]` appended to it (since `i` is 2, `i - 1` is 1).
- The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, `max_segment[0]`, and `new_segment`) remain unchanged or are updated based on the conditions described in the initial state.
