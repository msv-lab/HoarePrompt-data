Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list, `segments_variants` is updated based on the conditions described. If `max_segment[0]` > `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` is updated to include a new list `max_segment + [0]`. Otherwise, `segments_variants` now includes the list `new_segment + [0]` and `max_segment` is equal to `new_segment`.**

In natural language: The initial state is mostly unchanged, except that `new_segment` is now an empty list. The conditions for updating `segments_variants` and `max_segment` remain the same as described in the initial state.
