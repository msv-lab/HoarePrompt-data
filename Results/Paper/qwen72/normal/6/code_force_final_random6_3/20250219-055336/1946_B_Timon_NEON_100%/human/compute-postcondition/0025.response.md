The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than the length of `arr`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `arr` must still have at least 1 element remaining to be processed. Since the loop is iterating over the length of `arr`, and `i` is 0 at the end of the last iteration, after incrementing `i` by 1, `arr` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is updated based on the conditions described, and `segments_variants` is updated based on the conditions described.**
