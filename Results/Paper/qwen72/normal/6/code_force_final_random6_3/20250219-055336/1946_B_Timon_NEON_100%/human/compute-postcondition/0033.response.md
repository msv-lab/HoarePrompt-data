Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment[0]` is `max_segment[0] + arr[1]`, `new_segment[0]` is `new_segment[0] + arr[1]`, `segments_variants` is updated based on the conditions described.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` updates the value of `new_segment[0]` by adding the value of `arr[1]` to it.
- Since `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is `arr[1]`.
- The value of `max_segment[0]` is also updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[1]` as per the initial state.
- The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, and `segments_variants`) remain unchanged, but `segments_variants` is still updated based on the conditions described in the initial state.
