Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[1]`, `new_segment` is either an empty list or `[arr[1], 1]` based on the conditions described, and `segments_variants` is a list that includes the initial `max_segment` plus the value `[1]` at the end. If `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `new_segment[0]`, `max_segment` is updated to either an empty list or `[arr[1], 1]` based on the conditions described, `new_segment` is updated similarly, and `segments_variants` is updated with a new list that is `new_segment` plus `[1]`.***
