The objects in the loop head are `segment` and `segments_variants`. The loop will execute again if there is at least one more element in `segments_variants` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `segments_variants` must include at least one element: `new_segment` + [len(arr) - 1]. For the loop to execute one more time, `segments_variants` must have at least two elements, and `segment` will be the second element in `segments_variants`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `i` is len(arr) - 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is a list containing the sum of the last segment of non-negative numbers and the starting index of this segment, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of non-negative numbers found during the loop and the starting index of this segment, `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must include at least two elements, and `total_max_segment` is either unchanged or updated to `segment` if `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]` and `len(segment) != 1`, `segment` is the second element in `segments_variants`**
