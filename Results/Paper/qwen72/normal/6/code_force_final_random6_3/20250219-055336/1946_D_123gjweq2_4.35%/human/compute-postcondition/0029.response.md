Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`. Here, `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` is the result of the function `find_max` applied to the list `cur_arr` with the bit position decremented by 1. The length of `new_arr` is the number of elements in the list `new_arr`, which contains the cumulative XOR values of the elements in `cur_arr` that had the bit at position `bit` set to 0 at the time of their XOR operation.**
