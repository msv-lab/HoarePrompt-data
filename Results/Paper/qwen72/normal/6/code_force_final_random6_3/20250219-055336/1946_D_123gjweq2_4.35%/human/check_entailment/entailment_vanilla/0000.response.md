### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments `[l_1, r_1]`, `[l_2, r_2]`, ..., `[l_k, r_k]` such that:
     - `l_1 = 1`
     - `r_k = n`
     - `l_i <= r_i` for all `i` from 1 to `k`
     - `r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1}` for all `i` from 1 to `k - 1`
     - The bitwise OR of the XOR results of each segment is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(arr, x)`**:
     - This function calls `find_max(arr, 31)`. The choice of 31 is likely because the maximum value of `x` is less than `2^30`, so the highest bit to consider is the 30th bit (0-indexed), and 31 is the next bit.
   
   - **`find_max(cur_arr, bit)`**:
     - **Base Case**:
       - If `bit == -1`, it returns the length of `cur_arr`. This means we have considered all bits from 30 down to 0, and the length of the current array `cur_arr` is the number of segments that satisfy the condition.
     - **Recursive Case**:
       - It initializes `new_arr` and `xor` to 0.
       - It iterates through `cur_arr` and computes the running XOR of the elements.
       - If the current bit (bit `bit`) of the running XOR is not set (i.e., `xor >> bit & 1` is 0), it appends the current XOR to `new_arr` and resets `xor` to 0.
       - After the loop, if the current bit of the final `xor` is set, it sets `thing1` to -1, indicating that the current segment cannot be split further.
       - If the current bit of `x` is not set (i.e., `x >> bit & 1` is 0), it returns `thing1`.
       - If the current bit of `x` is set, it returns the maximum of:
         - The result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)`, which considers the next bit.
         - The length of `new_arr`, which represents the number of valid segments formed by the current bit.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `find_max` is designed to recursively check each bit from the highest to the lowest.
   - It correctly handles the base case when all bits have been considered.
   - It correctly splits the array into segments based on the current bit and checks if the segments can be valid.
   - The logic for handling the current bit of `x` and the running XOR is sound.
   - The function ensures that the segments are contiguous and start from the beginning and end at the end of the array.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function should handle cases where `x` is 0 or the array `arr` is all zeros.
   - The function should handle cases where no valid segments can be formed, returning -1.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The function has a time complexity of \(O(n \log x)\), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
