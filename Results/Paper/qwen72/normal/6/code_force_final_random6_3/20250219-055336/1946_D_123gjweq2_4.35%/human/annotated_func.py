#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find_max` accepts a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` such that 0 <= bit < 30.

The function then returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`, unless the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is set to 1, in which case it returns -1.
