The function `find_max` accepts a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` such that 0 <= bit < 30. It returns the length of `cur_arr` if `bit` is -1. Otherwise, it processes the list to create a new list `new_arr` containing cumulative XOR values of elements in `cur_arr` that had the bit at position `bit` set to 0 at the time of their XOR operation. The function then returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`, unless the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is set to 1, in which case it returns -1.
