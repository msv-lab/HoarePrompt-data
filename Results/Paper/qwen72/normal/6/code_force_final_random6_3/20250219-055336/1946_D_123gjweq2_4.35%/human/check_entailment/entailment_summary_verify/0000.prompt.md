You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr, x):

    return find_max(arr, 31)

#Function 2:
def find_max(cur_arr, bit):
    if bit == -1:
        return len(cur_arr)
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
    if xor >> bit & 1:
        thing1 = -1
    else:
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    if x >> bit & 1:
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
    else:
        return thing1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `find_max` accepts a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` such that 0 <= bit < 30. It returns the length of `cur_arr` if `bit` is -1. Otherwise, it processes the list to create a new list `new_arr` containing cumulative XOR values of elements in `cur_arr` that had the bit at position `bit` set to 0 at the time of their XOR operation. The function then returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`, unless the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is set to 1, in which case it returns -1.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` calls `find_max` with a fixed bit length of 31, which does not take into account the value of `x`. The problem description requires that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of the segments should be less than or equal to `x`, but the program does not properly check this condition. Instead, it seems to be trying to split the array based on the highest bit set in the elements, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

A specific test case where the program fails is:
```
Input:
1
3 1
1 2 3
```
Expected Output:
```
2
```
Actual Output:
```
3
```
The program incorrectly returns 3, which does not satisfy the condition that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of the segments should be less than or equal to `x` (which is 1 in this case). The correct segments should be [1, 1] and [2, 3], resulting in a bitwise OR of 1, which is the maximum possible `k` that satisfies the condition.
