Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is `a[0] + dif`, `ans_list` contains `a[0]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`, `res` remains `n - 1`, `k` is `k - dif`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - dif * (i + 1)`.
- Since `i` is 0, `dif * (i + 1)` simplifies to `dif * 1`, which is `dif`.
- Therefore, `k` is updated to `k - dif`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
