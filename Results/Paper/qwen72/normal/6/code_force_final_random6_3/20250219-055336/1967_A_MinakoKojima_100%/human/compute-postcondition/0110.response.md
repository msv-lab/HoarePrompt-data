Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is either `a[0]` or `a[0] + dif` or `a[0] + dif + k // 2`, `ans_list` contains `a[0]`, `n` is greater than 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `i` is 1, `k` remains unchanged, `res` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
