Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer provided by the user input where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a`, `res` is equal to `n - 1`, `i` is 0, `dif` is equal to `a[1] - a[0]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]` calculates the difference between the second element and the first element of the sorted list `a`. Since `i` is 0, `a[i + 1]` refers to the second element of `a`, and `a[i]` refers to the first element of `a`. The result of this subtraction is stored in the variable `dif`. All other variables remain unchanged.
