Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is either `a[0]` or `a[0] + dif`, `ans_list` contains `a[0]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]` and `dif` is not 0, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, `res` is `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
