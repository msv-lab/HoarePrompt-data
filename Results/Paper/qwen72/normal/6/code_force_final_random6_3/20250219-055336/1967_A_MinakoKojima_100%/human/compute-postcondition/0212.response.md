Output State: **`ans_list` contains the final `ans` value for each test case, and all elements in `ans_list` have been printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, every element in the `ans_list` has been printed to the console. The list `ans_list` remains unchanged, but all its elements have been processed by the loop.
