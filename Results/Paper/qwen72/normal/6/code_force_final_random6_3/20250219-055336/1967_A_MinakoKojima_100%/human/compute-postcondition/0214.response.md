Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result for each test case. Each test case involves the number of distinct types of cards `n`, the number of coins `k`, and a list `a` of integers representing the number of cards of each type. The function calculates and prints the maximum number of cards that can be bought with `k` coins for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but it prints the results to the console. The state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed, and the results have been printed. **
