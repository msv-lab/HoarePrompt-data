Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `ans` is `dif`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `res` is `n - 3`.** 

The value of `ans` is updated to be equal to `dif`, which is the difference between the second and first elements of the sorted list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 2`; otherwise, `res` is `n - 3`.
