Output State: **`a` remains a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is the final value after all iterations and is now `ans + k // n`, `ans_list` contains `a[0]`, `n` is the input integer, `k` is not 0, `res` is the final value after all iterations and is now `res + k % n`.**

The value of `res` is updated to `res + k % n`, where `k % n` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
