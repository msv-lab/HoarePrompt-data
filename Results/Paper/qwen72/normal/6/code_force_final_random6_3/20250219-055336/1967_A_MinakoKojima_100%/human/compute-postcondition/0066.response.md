The code snippet `ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)` updates the value of `ans` based on the current value of `ans` and the value of `n`.

- `ans` is initially the final value after all iterations.
- `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.

The expression `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` is added to the current value of `ans`. This means the new value of `ans` will be:

\[ \text{new\_ans} = \text{ans} + (\text{ans} - 1) \times (n - 1) \]

Let's break it down:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ans_list` is an empty list.
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `ans` is the final value after all iterations.
   - `res` is the number of unique elements in `a` minus 1. If `k` is not 0, `res` is increased by 0 % `n`.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The value of `ans` is updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`.

3. **Calculation:**
   - Let the initial value of `ans` be `ans_initial`.
   - The new value of `ans` will be:
     \[ \text{new\_ans} = \text{ans\_initial} + (\text{ans\_initial} - 1) \times (n - 1) \]

4. **Output State:**
   - `ans_list` is an empty list.
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `ans` is now `ans_initial + (ans_initial - 1) * (n - 1)`.
   - `res` is the number of unique elements in `a` minus 1. If `k` is not 0, `res` is increased by 0 % `n`.

Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, `_` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is now `ans_initial + (ans_initial - 1) * (n - 1)`, `res` is the number of unique elements in `a` minus 1. If `k` is not 0, `res` is increased by 0 % `n`.**
