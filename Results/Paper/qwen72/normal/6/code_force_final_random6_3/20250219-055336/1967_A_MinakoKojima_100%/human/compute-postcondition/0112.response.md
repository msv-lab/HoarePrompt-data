Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is either `a[0]` or `a[0] + dif` or `a[0] + dif + k // 2`, `ans_list` contains `a[0]`, `n` is greater than 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `i` is 1. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 3`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is 0, `k` remains unchanged, `res` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `k` is updated to `k - dif * 2` and `res` is `n - 4` if `k` is greater than 0, otherwise `res` is `n - 3`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0 and `res` remains unchanged.***
