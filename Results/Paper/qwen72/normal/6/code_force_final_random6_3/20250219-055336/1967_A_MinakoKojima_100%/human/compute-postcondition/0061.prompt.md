Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a`, `res` is equal to `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, and `dif` is 0. If `dif` is not 0, `res` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, and if `k` was initially 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `ans`, `res`, and `k` are updated based on the conditions provided. If `dif` is 0, `res` remains equal to `n - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`. If `dif` is not 0, `k` remains 0, `ans` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `res` is `n - 3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 3` and `ans` is 0. If `dif` is not 0, and `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, `res` is `n - 4`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is not 0, and `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * 3`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, `res` is `n - 5`, and `k` is reduced by `dif * 3`. If `dif` is not 0, and `k` is less than `dif * 3`, `k` is set to 0, `ans` is set to `k // 3`, and `res` remains as `n - 4 + k % 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
