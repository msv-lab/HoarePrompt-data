You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include them. For the problem to be solved, the function should accept parameters `t` (number of test cases), `n` and `k` (integers for each test case representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins), and a list `a` of length `n` containing integers representing the number of cards of each type. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Sorting and Initialization**: The program sorts the list `a` and initializes `ans` to the smallest number of cards of any type. This is a good starting point because the smallest number of cards will limit the number of complete permutations we can form.

3. **Balancing the Number of Cards**: The program iteratively balances the number of cards of each type by using the available coins `k` to increase the number of cards of the types that have fewer cards. It ensures that the difference between the number of cards of any two types is minimized, which is crucial for forming as many permutations as possible.

4. **Handling Remaining Coins**: If there are remaining coins after balancing the cards, the program uses them to further increase the number of cards of the type with the fewest cards, ensuring that the number of complete permutations is maximized.

5. **Calculating the Score**: The program calculates the score by considering the number of complete permutations that can be formed and the remaining cards that can contribute to additional subarrays.

The logic and steps in the program align with the problem requirements and handle edge cases such as when `k` is zero or when the number of cards of each type is already balanced. The program also correctly outputs the maximum score for each test case.

Given the complexity of the problem and the thorough handling of various cases, the program seems to be correct for all potential inputs.
