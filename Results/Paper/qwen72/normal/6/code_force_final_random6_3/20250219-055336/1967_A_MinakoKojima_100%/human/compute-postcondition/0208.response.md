To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for a in ans_list:
```

The objects in the loop head are:
- `a` (the current element being iterated over)
- `ans_list` (the list being iterated over)

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `ans_list` contains the final `ans` value for each test case and must have at least one element.
- `a` is the first element in `ans_list`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following must be true:
- `ans_list` must have at least two elements, so that there is a next element to iterate over.
- `a` will be the second element in `ans_list` at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`ans_list` contains the final `ans` value for each test case and must have at least two elements, `a` is the second element in `ans_list`**
