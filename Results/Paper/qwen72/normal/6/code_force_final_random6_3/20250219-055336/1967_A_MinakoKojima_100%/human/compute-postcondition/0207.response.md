The `print(a)` statement will print the first element of the list `ans_list`.

Based on the precondition:
- `ans_list` is a list that contains the final `ans` value for each test case.
- `ans_list` must have at least one element.
- `a` is the first element in `ans_list`.

Since the exact values in `ans_list` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the first element of `ans_list`.

Output: **a (where a is the first element in the ans_list)**
