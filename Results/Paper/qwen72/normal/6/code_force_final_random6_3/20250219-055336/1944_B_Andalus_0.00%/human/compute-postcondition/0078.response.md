Output State: **`sng` must contain at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `sng`, `sz` is increased by 1. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The list `sng` still contains at least three elements, and `elem` remains the third element in `sng`. The variable `sz` has been incremented by 1. If the new value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
