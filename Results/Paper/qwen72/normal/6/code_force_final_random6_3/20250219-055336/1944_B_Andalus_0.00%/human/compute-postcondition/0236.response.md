To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `sng` is a non-empty list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist) and must have at least one more element.
   - `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements.
   - `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` (or the total number of elements in `rdb` times 2, whichever is smaller) plus 2.
   - `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged.
   - `elem` is the next element in `sng`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Since `sng` is a non-empty list and must have at least one more element, `elem` will be the next element in `sng`.
   - The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space (without a newline).

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The value of `elem` is the next element in the `sng` list.
   - Since the exact elements of `sng` are not provided, we can only describe the value of `elem` in terms of the list `sng`.

Given the initial state and conditions, the output of the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will be the next element in the `sng` list followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the next element in the `sng` list)**
