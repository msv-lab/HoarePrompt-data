Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `sz` is 4 if `k - sz >= 2` was true, otherwise `sz` remains 2. `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged, `rdb` must have at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `rdb`. The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
