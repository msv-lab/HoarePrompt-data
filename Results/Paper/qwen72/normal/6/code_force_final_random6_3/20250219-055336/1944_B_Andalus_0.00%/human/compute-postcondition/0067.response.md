Based on the initial state provided:

- `sng` must contain at least one element.
- `elem` is the first element in `sng`.
- If the size of `sng` (`sz`) is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`sng` must contain at least one element**: This means `sng` is not empty and has at least one element.
2. **`elem` is the first element in `sng`**: This means `elem` is the value of the first element in the list `sng`.
3. **If the size of `sng` (`sz`) is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**: This condition affects the flow of the program but does not directly impact the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement will still execute as long as it is not inside a loop or if statement that is broken due to this condition.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the first element of the list `sng` followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the first element of the list sng)**
