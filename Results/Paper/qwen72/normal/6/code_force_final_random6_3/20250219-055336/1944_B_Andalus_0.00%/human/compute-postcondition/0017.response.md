Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of input integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list. `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`.***
