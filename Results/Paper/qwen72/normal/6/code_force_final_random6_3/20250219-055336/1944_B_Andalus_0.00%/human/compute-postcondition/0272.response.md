The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[1]`, `rdb` has `rgt[2]` appended to it. Otherwise, `rdb` remains unchanged.**
