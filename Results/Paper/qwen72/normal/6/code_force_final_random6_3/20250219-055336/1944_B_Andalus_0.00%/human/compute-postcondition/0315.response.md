Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements.
   - `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus 2.
   - The loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each.
   - `sng` must be a non-empty iterable.
   - `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the current `elem`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the next part of the loop or statement.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is printing the value of `elem` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `elem` is the next element in the iterable `sng` after the current `elem`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `sng` is a non-empty iterable and `elem` is the next element in `sng`, the `print` statement will output the next element in `sng`.
   - The exact value of `elem` is not provided, but it is the next element in the iterable `sng`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the next element in the iterable `sng` followed by a space.

Output: **[next element in sng] (where [next element in sng] is the next element in the iterable `sng`)**
