Output State: **`ldb` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the third element of `ldb`, `sz` is increased by 2, if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The value of `sz` is incremented by 2, but the initial value of `sz` is not specified, so we can only say that it is now 2 more than its original value. The condition that `sz` must be greater than or equal to `k` for the program to break out of the most internal loop or if statement remains unchanged. The other variables and conditions (`ldb` having at least three elements and `elem` being the third element of `ldb`) are still valid.
