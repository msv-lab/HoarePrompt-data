The value of `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. The code appends `rgt[i]` to `rdb`. Since `i` is 2, `rgt[2]` is appended to `rdb`. The condition that `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[1]` is not checked because the code directly appends `rgt[2]` to `rdb`. Therefore, `rdb` now contains the value of `rgt[2]` appended to it. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `rdb` has `rgt[2]` appended to it.**
