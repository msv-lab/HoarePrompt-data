The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. The variable `i` should start at 1 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of input integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
