Output State: **`sng` contains the element `lft[i]`, `sz` is the last even number less than `k` that can be achieved by adding 2 in each iteration, `T` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 3, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is a list containing the first element of `lft` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, otherwise `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `i` is 3.** 

The code snippet `sng.append(lft[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `sng`. Since `i` is 3, the element `lft[3]` is added to `sng`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
