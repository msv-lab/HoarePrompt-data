Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus 1, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, and `sng` must be a non-empty iterable. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sz` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The updated value of `sz` is now the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2, plus 1.
