Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist) and must have at least 2 elements.
   - `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements.
   - `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k + 1`.
   - `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged.
   - `elem` is the second element in `sng`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(elem, end=' ')` will print the value of `elem` followed by a space.

3. **Determine the Value of `elem`:**
   - `sng` is a list that contains elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements.
   - `sng` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `elem` is the second element in `sng`.

Since `sng` is a list with at least 2 elements, `elem` will be the second element of this list. The exact value of `elem` depends on the specific elements in `lft` and how they are filtered to form `sng`.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `elem` followed by a space.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **[elem] (where elem is the second element in the list sng, and sng is a list containing elements from lft that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements)**
