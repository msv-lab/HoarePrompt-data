The code `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the second element of the list `lft` to the list `ldb`. Given that `i` is 1, and the second element of `lft` is equal to the first element of `lft`, the value being appended to `ldb` is the same as the first element of `lft`.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of input integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is a list containing the second element of `lft`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and the second element of `lft` is equal to the first element of `lft`.**
