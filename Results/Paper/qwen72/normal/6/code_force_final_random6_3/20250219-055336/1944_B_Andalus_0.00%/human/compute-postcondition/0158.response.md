Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `sz`, `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged. If `rgt[3]` is equal to `rgt[2]`, `rdb` now contains the value of `rgt[3]` in addition to its previous elements. Otherwise, `rdb` remains unchanged.***
