The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the input integer `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of input integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `ldb` is a list containing the elements `lft[2]` and `lft[i]`, and `rdb` and `sng` are empty lists. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[2]`. If `i` is not less than `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` remains an empty list. In all cases, `ldb` and `rdb` are empty lists if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`.**
