Output State: **`i` remains `n - 1`, `n` remains greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` remains unchanged, `sz` is now `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + 2`, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(rdb))` elements of `rdb` twice each, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop has been exited and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then the loop has printed additional elements up to `k` times.**

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
