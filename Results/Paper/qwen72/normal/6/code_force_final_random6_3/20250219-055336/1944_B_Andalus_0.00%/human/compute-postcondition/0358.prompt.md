Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters: an integer `n` and an integer `k`, where `2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4` and `1 <= k <= floor(n / 2)`. Additionally, it should take a list `a` of length `2n` containing integers from `1` to `n`, each appearing exactly twice. `T` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lft = lst[:n]
    rgt = lst[n:]
    ldb = []
    rdb = []
    sng = []
    lft.sort()
    rgt.sort()
    for i in range(1, n):
        if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
            ldb.append(lft[i])
        elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
            sng.append(lft[i])
    for i in range(1, n):
        if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
            rdb.append(rgt[i])
    sz = 0
    for elem in ldb:
        if sz >= k:
            break
        if k - sz >= 2:
            print(elem, elem, end=' ')
            sz += 2
    for elem in sng:
        if sz >= k:
            break
        print(elem, end=' ')
        sz += 1
    print()
    sz = 0
    for elem in rdb:
        if sz >= k:
            break
        if k - sz >= 2:
            print(elem, elem, end=' ')
            sz += 2
    for elem in sng:
        if sz >= k:
            break
        print(elem, end=' ')
        sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sng` is processed until `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `sng` is exhausted. `sz` is the last even number less than `k` that can be achieved by adding 2 in each iteration. If `k` is reached, the loop breaks. If `sng` is exhausted before `sz` reaches `k`, `sz` will be the last even number added before the list ended.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` (or the total number of elements in `rdb` times 2, whichever is smaller) plus the number of elements printed from `sng` (which is an even number or `k` if `k` is reached first), `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before `sz` reached or exceeded `k` (or the last element in `sng` if `sz` never reaches or exceeds `k`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` remains `n - 1`, `n` remains greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` remains unchanged, `sz` is now `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + min(k - min(k, 2 * len(rdb)), len(sng))`, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(rdb))` elements of `rdb` twice each, and then printed additional elements from `sng` up to `k` times.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
