Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, `sng` must be a non-empty iterable, and `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
