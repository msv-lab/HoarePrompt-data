The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n`, so `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of input integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `ldb` is a list containing the second element of `lft`, `rdb` and `sng` are empty lists. Otherwise, `ldb` and `rdb` are empty lists, and `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. If `i` is not less than `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` remains an empty list.**
