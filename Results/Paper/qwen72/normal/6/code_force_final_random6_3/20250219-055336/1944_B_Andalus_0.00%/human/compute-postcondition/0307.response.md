The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`. The loop can execute again if `sng` has more elements to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus 1, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, and `sng` must be a non-empty iterable.

For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still be a non-empty iterable, and `elem` will be the next element in `sng`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus 1, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, `sng` must be a non-empty iterable, and `elem` is the next element in `sng`**
