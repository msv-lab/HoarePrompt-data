Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sng` is an empty list, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` (or the total number of elements in `rdb` times 2, whichever is smaller) plus the number of elements printed from `sng` (which is an even number or `k` if `k` is reached first), `T` is unchanged, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rdb` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before `sz` reached or exceeded `k` (or the last element in `sng` if `sz` never reaches or exceeds `k`), `_` is `n`, `rgt` is the list of elements in `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `sng` is a list that may contain the element `lft[1]` if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i] != lft[i + 1]`, otherwise `sng` remains an empty list, `ldb` is a list containing the first element of `lft` (which is `lft[1]`) if `lft[i] == lft[i - 1]`, otherwise `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` (or the total number of elements in `rdb` times 2, whichever is smaller) plus the number of elements printed from `sng` (which is 1 if `sng` contains `lft[1]`, otherwise 0), `T` is unchanged, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rdb` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before `sz` reached or exceeded `k` (or the last element in `sng` if `sz` never reaches or exceeds `k`), `_` is `n`, `rgt` is the list of elements in `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order. If `lft[i] == lft[i - 1]`, `ldb` contains `lft[1]`. Otherwise, `sng` may contain `lft[1]` if the conditions are met, and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rdb` is an empty list, `rgt` is the list of elements in `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `T` is unchanged, `_` is `n`, `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` (or the total number of elements in `rdb` times 2, whichever is smaller) plus the number of elements printed from `sng` (which is 1 if `sng` contains an element, otherwise 0). If `lft[i] == lft[i - 1]`, `ldb` contains `lft[1]` and `lft[2]`, and `sng` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `ldb` contains `lft[1]` if `lft[2] == lft[1]`, otherwise `ldb` is an empty list, and `sng` may contain `lft[2]` if `i < n - 1` and `lft[2] != lft[3]`, otherwise `sng` remains an empty list. `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before `sz` reached or exceeded `k` (or the last element in `sng` if `sz` never reaches or exceeds `k`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rdb` is an empty list, `rgt` is the list of elements in `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `T` is unchanged, `_` is `n`, `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` (or the total number of elements in `rdb` times 2, whichever is smaller) plus the number of elements printed from `sng` (which is 1 if `sng` contains an element, otherwise 0). If `lft[i] == lft[i - 1]`, `ldb` contains `lft[1]` and `lft[3]`, and `sng` remains an empty list. Otherwise, if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i] != lft[i + 1]`, `sng` contains `lft[3]`, and `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before `sz` reached or exceeded `k` (or the last element in `sng` if `sz` never reaches or exceeds `k`). If `lft[i] != lft[i - 1]` and either `i >= n - 1` or `lft[i] == lft[i + 1]`, `sng` remains an empty list, `ldb` is the same as before, and `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before `sz` reached or exceeded `k` (or the last element in `sng` if `sz` never reaches or exceeds `k`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
