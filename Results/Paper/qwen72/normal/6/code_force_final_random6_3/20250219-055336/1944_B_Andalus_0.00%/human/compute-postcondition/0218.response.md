Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist).
   - `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements.
   - `sz` is 4 if `k - sz >= 2` was true, otherwise `sz` remains 2.
   - `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged.
   - `rdb` must have at least three elements.
   - `elem` is the third element in `rdb`.
   - The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is printing the variable `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `elem` is defined as the third element in the list `rdb`.
   - Since `rdb` must have at least three elements, `elem` is a valid reference to the third element of `rdb`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.

Given the initial state, the value of `elem` is the third element in `rdb`. Since the exact values of `rdb` are not provided, we can only describe `elem` in terms of its position in the list.

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the third element in the list `rdb`)**
