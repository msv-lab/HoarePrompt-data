Postcondition: ***`ldb` must have at least two elements, `elem` is the second element of `ldb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and the program exits the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `k - sz` is at least 2, `sz` is increased by 2. If `k - sz` is less than 2, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block without modifying `sz`.***
