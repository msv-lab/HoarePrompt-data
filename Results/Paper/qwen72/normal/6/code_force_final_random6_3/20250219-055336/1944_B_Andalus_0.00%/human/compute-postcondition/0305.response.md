To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context in which the statement is executed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements.
   - `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2.
   - The loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each.
   - `sng` must be a non-empty iterable.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Context:**
   - The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement is inside a loop or conditional block that is iterating over the elements of `sng`.

3. **Determine the Value of `elem`:**
   - Since `sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` will be the current element of `sng` being processed by the loop.

4. **Determine the Output:**
   - The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space, without moving to a new line.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The exact value of `elem` is not specified, but it is an element from the non-empty iterable `sng`.

Given this information, the output will be the value of `elem` followed by a space. Since `sng` is non-empty, `elem` will be some value from `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is the current element from the non-empty iterable sng)**
