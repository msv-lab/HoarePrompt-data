Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `sng` is processed until `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, or `sng` is exhausted.
   - `sz` is now 0.
   - `rdb` is a list that must have at least 1 element.
   - `elem` is the first element in `rdb`.
   - The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 2, which means `k` is at least 2 since `sz` is currently 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Determine the Value of `elem`:**
   - `elem` is the first element in the list `rdb`.
   - Since `rdb` must have at least 1 element, `elem` is a known value.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output `elem` followed by `elem` and a space at the end.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the first element in the list `rdb`)**
