### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function `func` starts by reading the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads the list `lst` of length `2n`.

2. **Splitting the List:**
   - The list `lst` is split into two halves: `lft` (first half) and `rgt` (second half).

3. **Sorting the Halves:**
   - Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted. This ensures that any duplicates are adjacent.

4. **Identifying Duplicates and Singles:**
   - The function iterates through the sorted `lft` list to identify duplicates and single elements:
     - If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i-1]`, it means `lft[i]` is a duplicate, and it is added to the `ldb` list.
     - If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i-1]` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i+1]`, it means `lft[i]` is a single element, and it is added to the `sng` list.
   - Similarly, the function iterates through the sorted `rgt` list to identify duplicates and adds them to the `rdb` list.

5. **Constructing the Output Arrays:**
   - The function constructs the output arrays `l` and `r`:
     - It first tries to use the duplicates from `ldb` and `rdb` to fill the arrays. If `k - sz >= 2`, it prints a duplicate element twice and increments `sz` by 2.
     - If there are not enough duplicates to fill the arrays, it uses the single elements from `sng` to fill the remaining positions.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the elements of `l` and `r` in the required format.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The function correctly identifies duplicates and single elements in the sorted halves.
  - It ensures that the arrays `l` and `r` are of length `2k` and that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.
  - The use of duplicates ensures that the XOR condition is met, as `x \oplus x = 0` for any integer `x`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles the case where there are not enough duplicates by using single elements.
  - It ensures that the output arrays are of the correct length `2k`.

- **Complexity:**
  - The sorting step has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).
  - The subsequent iterations through the sorted lists are \(O(n)\).
  - The overall complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly solve the problem by ensuring that the output arrays `l` and `r` meet the required conditions. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
