Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `ldb` must have at least two elements.
- `elem` is the second element of `ldb`.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and the program exits the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, if `k - sz` is at least 2, `sz` is increased by 2.
- If `k - sz` is less than 2, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block without modifying `sz`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`elem`**: This variable is defined as the second element of the list `ldb`. Since `ldb` must have at least two elements, `elem` will always be a valid element.
2. **`print(elem, elem, end=' ')`**: This print statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and will not move to a new line after printing (due to `end=' '`).

### Output:
The code will print the second element of the list `ldb` twice, separated by a space, and will not move to a new line after printing.

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the second element of the list `ldb`)**
