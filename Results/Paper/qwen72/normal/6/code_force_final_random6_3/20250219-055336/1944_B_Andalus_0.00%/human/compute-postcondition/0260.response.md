Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `sng` is a list that may contain `lft[2]` if `i < n - 1` and `lft[2] != lft[3]`, otherwise `sng` remains an empty list, `ldb` is a list containing the first element of `lft` (which is `lft[1]`) if `lft[2] == lft[1]`, otherwise `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` (or the total number of elements in `rdb` times 2, whichever is smaller) plus the number of elements printed from `sng` (which is 1 if `sng` contains `lft[2]`, otherwise 0), `T` is unchanged, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rdb` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before `sz` reached or exceeded `k` (or the last element in `sng` if `sz` never reaches or exceeds `k`), `_` is `n`, `rgt` is the list of elements in `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.***
