The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and the list `rdb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `rdb`. If `rdb` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `sng` and `sz` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute, `rdb` must have at least one element, and `elem` should be the first element in `rdb`.

State: **`sng` is processed until `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, or `sng` is exhausted, `sz` is now 0, `rdb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`**
