a and p are lists of integers of the same length n, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and each element in p is a unique integer from 1 to n. s is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, where 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. k is a positive integer representing the number of turns, where 1 <= k <= 10^9.
