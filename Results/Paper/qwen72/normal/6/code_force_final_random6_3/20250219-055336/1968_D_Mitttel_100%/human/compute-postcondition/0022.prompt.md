Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where each element of `p` is a distinct integer from 1 to `n`, and each element of `a` is an integer (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). `s` is a list of two integers [P_B, P_S] representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively, where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ `n`. `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) representing the number of turns in the game. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is 0. `cur` is 0. `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.
Code of the loop:
while not vis[s] and k > 0:
    vis[s] = 1
    mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
    cur += a[s]
    k -= 1
    s = p[s]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` and `p` remain unchanged, `s` is updated to `p[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `mx` is updated to `max(0, cur + k * a[P_B])` or `max(0, cur + k * a[P_S])`, `cur` is updated to `a[P_B] + a[P_S]`, `vis` is updated such that `vis[P_B - 1]` and `vis[P_S - 1]` are both set to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` and `p` remain unchanged, `s` is updated to `p[s]`, `k` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `mx` is updated to `max(mx, cur + (k-1) * a[s])`, `cur` is updated to `a[P_B] + a[P_S] + a[s]`, `vis` is updated such that `vis[P_B - 1]`, `vis[P_S - 1]`, and `vis[s]` are all set to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` and `p` remain unchanged, `s` is updated to `p[s]`, `k` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `mx` is updated to `max(mx, cur + (k-1) * a[s])`, `cur` is updated to `a[P_B] + a[P_S] + a[s] + a[s]`, `vis[s]` is `True`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
