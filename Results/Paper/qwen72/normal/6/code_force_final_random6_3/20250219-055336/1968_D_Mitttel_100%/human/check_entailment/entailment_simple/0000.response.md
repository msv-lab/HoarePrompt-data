### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Adjustments:**
   - The program correctly parses the input for each test case.
   - It adjusts the indices for the permutation `p` and the array `a` by subtracting 1, which is necessary because Python uses 0-based indexing while the problem description uses 1-based indexing.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the game for a single player starting from position `s` for `k` turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score observed.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score.
   - It initializes `vis` to a list of zeros, which will keep track of visited positions to detect cycles.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues until either `k` reaches 0 or the current position `s` has been visited (`vis[s]` becomes 1).
   - Inside the loop:
     - The current position `s` is marked as visited.
     - The maximum score `mx` is updated to the maximum of the current `mx` and the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining `k` turns (`cur + k * a[s]`).
     - The current score `cur` is increased by the value at the current position `a[s]`.
     - The number of turns `k` is decremented by 1.
     - The player moves to the next position `p[s]`.

4. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The loop correctly detects cycles by marking visited positions.
   - When a cycle is detected, the loop terminates, and the function returns the maximum score observed.

5. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After simulating the game for both Bodya and Sasha, the program compares their scores.
   - It prints "Draw" if both scores are equal, "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, and "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input parsing, simulates the game for both players, and correctly compares their scores to determine the winner. The cycle detection mechanism ensures that the program does not get stuck in an infinite loop.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
