Output State: **`a` and `p` remain unchanged, `s` remains `[P_B, P_S]`, `k` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `mx` is updated to `max(0, cur + k * a[P_B])` or `max(0, cur + k * a[P_S])`, `cur` remains 0, `vis` is updated such that `vis[P_B - 1]` and `vis[P_S - 1]` are both set to 1.**

Explanation:
- `mx` is updated to the maximum of its current value (which is 0) and the value of `cur + k * a[s]`.
- Since `s` is `[P_B, P_S]`, `a[s]` could be either `a[P_B]` or `a[P_S]`.
- `cur` remains 0, so the new value of `mx` will be `max(0, 0 + k * a[P_B])` or `max(0, 0 + k * a[P_S])`, which simplifies to `max(0, k * a[P_B])` or `max(0, k * a[P_S])`.
- All other variables (`a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, `n`, `cur`, `vis`) remain unchanged, except for the specific updates to `vis` mentioned in the initial state.
