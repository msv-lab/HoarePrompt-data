Output State: **`a` and `p` remain unchanged, `s` is updated to `p[s]`, `k` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `mx` is updated to `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`, `cur` is updated to `a[P_B] + a[P_S] + a[s] + a[s]`, `vis[s]` is `True`**

Explanation:
- `cur` is updated by adding `a[s]` to its current value, which was previously `a[P_B] + a[P_S] + a[s]`. Therefore, the new value of `cur` is `a[P_B] + a[P_S] + a[s] + a[s]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
