Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not always generate the correct output for every potential case. For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 3`. The program generates the string `abcabc`, but this string does not contain all possible substrings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets (`a`, `b`, `c`). Specifically, the substring `cc` is missing. The correct output should be a string like `abcbac` which contains all the required substrings: `aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, and `cc`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
