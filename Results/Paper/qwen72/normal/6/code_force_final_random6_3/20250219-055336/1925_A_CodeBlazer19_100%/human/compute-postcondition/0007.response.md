The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is an integer between 1 and 676, inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `t` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `t` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 676, inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
