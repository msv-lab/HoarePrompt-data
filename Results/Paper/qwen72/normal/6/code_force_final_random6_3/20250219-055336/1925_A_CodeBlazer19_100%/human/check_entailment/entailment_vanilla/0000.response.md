Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`. The goal is to find the shortest possible string `s` that satisfies this condition.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `k`.

3. **Generating the String**:
   - The program generates the string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` and repeating this substring `n` times.
   - For example, if `k = 3` and `n = 2`, the program will generate the string `'abcabc'`.

4. **Correctness of the Generated String**:
   - The generated string `s` is of length `k * n`.
   - The string `s` contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets because each character from the first `k` alphabets appears at least `n` times in the string.
   - However, the program does not necessarily generate the shortest possible string `s` that satisfies the condition. For example, for `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the program generates `'aabb'`, but the correct shortest string is `'baab'`.

5. **Optimality**:
   - The program's approach of repeating the first `k` characters `n` times is not optimal. The optimal solution should aim to minimize the length of `s` while ensuring all required subsequences are present.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the optimal string is `'baab'` because it is the shortest string that contains all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 2 alphabets (`'aa'`, `'ab'`, `'ba'`, `'bb'`).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program generates a valid string `s` that contains all required subsequences, but it does not always generate the shortest possible string.
   - Since the problem specifically asks for the shortest string, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
