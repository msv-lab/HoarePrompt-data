Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676, inclusive, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, `k` is the last input integer.**

**Explanation**: After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the loop variable `i` will have incremented from 0 to `t-1`. The variables `n` and `k` will be set to the values of the last input provided during the final iteration of the loop. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, as it was defined before the loop and is not modified within the loop.
