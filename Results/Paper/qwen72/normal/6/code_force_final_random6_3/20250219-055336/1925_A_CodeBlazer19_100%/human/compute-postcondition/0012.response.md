Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from standard input. It then prints a string that consists of the first `k` letters of the English alphabet repeated `n` times. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state of the program includes the printed results for each test case. **
