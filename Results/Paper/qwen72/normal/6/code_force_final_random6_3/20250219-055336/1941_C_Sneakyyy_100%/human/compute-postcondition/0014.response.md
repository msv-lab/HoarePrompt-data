Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string with length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to index `i + 2` (inclusive). If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1. `len(a)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 3, otherwise `len(a)` must be greater than 3 if `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to be the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2` (inclusive).
- The values of `n`, `a`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The condition for the length of `a` based on the value of `i` still holds.
