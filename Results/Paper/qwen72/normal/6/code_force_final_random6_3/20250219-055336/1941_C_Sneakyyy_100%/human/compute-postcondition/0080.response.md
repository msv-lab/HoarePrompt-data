To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a new input string.
   - `ans` is the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`.
   - `i` is the final index after the loop has completed, which is `len(a) - 2` or greater.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `n` is not directly used in the `print(ans)` statement, so we can ignore it for this specific task.
   - `a` is the input string, and the exact value of `a` is not provided, but it is a string.
   - `ans` is the count of how many times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in the string `a`.
   - `i` is the final index after the loop has completed, but it is not used in the `print(ans)` statement, so we can also ignore it for this task.

3. **Determine the Output**:
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.

Since the exact value of `a` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the count of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string a)**
