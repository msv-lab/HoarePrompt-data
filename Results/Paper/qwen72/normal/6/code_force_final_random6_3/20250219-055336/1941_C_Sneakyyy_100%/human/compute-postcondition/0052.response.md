Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string, `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' or 'pie' appears in `a`, and `i` is the length of `a` minus 2.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `a` also remains unchanged as it is the input string and is not altered within the loop.
- The variable `ans` will be the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`. Each time the loop finds one of these substrings, `ans` is incremented by 1.
- The variable `i` will be the length of the string `a` minus 2. This is because the loop increments `i` by 3 each time it finds 'map' or 'pie', and by 1 otherwise. The loop stops when `i` is no longer less than `len(a) - 2`, so the final value of `i` will be `len(a) - 2`.
