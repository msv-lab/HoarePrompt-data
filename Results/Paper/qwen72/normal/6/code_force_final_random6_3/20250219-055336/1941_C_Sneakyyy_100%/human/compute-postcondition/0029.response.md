Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string, `ans` is the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the previous `a`, and `i` is the length of the previous `a` minus 2 or the index just after the last checked substring in the previous `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a = input()` updates the value of `a` to a new input string. The other variables (`n`, `ans`, and `i`) are not affected by this code, so their values remain as they were in the initial state. The value of `ans` still represents the number of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the previous `a`, and `i` still represents the length of the previous `a` minus 2 or the index just after the last checked substring in the previous `a`.
