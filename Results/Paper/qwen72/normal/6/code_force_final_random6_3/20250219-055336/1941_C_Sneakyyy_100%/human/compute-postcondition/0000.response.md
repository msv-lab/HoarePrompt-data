The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly adjusted, as it will be assigned values from 0 to `int(input()) - 1` during the loop execution.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input provided to the loop is a positive integer, which will allow the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
