The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop is controlled by the value of `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t` and the current value of `_`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, and the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
- `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from the input.
- `queries` is a list of integers.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, and the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from the input, `queries` is a list of integers, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`**.
