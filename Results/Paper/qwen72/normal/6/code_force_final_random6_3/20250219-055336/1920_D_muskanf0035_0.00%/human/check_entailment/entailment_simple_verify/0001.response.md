Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires handling two types of operations on an initially empty array:
     - Append an integer `x` to the array.
     - Append `x` copies of the current array to itself.
   - After performing all operations, we need to answer queries about the `k`-th element of the array.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (number of operations), `operations` (list of operations), and `queries` (list of queries).
   - It initializes an empty array `array` and an empty result list `result`.
   - It iterates through each operation:
     - If the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the array.
     - If the operation type is 2, it extends the array by appending `x` copies of the current array to itself.
   - After all operations, it processes each query by appending the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` to the result list.
   - Finally, it returns the result list.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It reads the operations and queries.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Memory and Performance:**
     - The array can grow very large, especially with operation type 2, which appends `x` copies of the current array. This can lead to memory issues and slow performance.
     - For example, if `x` is a large number (up to \(10^9\)), the array can become extremely large, which is not feasible to store in memory.
   - **Correctness of Query Handling:**
     - The query handling in `func_1` uses `(k - 1) % len(array)` to find the `k`-th element. This assumes that the array is cyclic, which is not always the case.
     - For large `x` values in operation type 2, the array length can exceed the query indices, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

5. **Annotated Code Evaluation:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The initial state before `func_1` is called is accurate: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of tuples, and `queries` is a list of positive integers.
   - The state after processing each operation is also accurate: `array` is updated correctly based on the operation type.
   - The state after processing all queries is accurate: `result` contains the elements at indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`.

6. **Correctness Evaluation:**
   - The current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` will work for small inputs and simple cases, but it will fail for large inputs due to memory and performance issues.
   - The query handling is incorrect for large `x` values in operation type 2, as it does not account for the actual size of the array after each operation. Specifically, the cyclic nature of the array is not a valid assumption for all cases, especially when `x` is very large.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all valid inputs as described in the problem.

Final: **False**
