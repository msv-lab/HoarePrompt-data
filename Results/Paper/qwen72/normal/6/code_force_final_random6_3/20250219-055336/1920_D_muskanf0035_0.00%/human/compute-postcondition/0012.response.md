To determine what will be printed by the `print(*result)` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` and `q` are specific positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, q \leq 10^5\).
   - The sum of `n` and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).
   - `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from the input.
   - `queries` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.
   - `_` is incremented by `n`.
   - `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`.

2. **Understanding the `print(*result)` Statement:**
   - The `print(*result)` statement will unpack the elements of the `result` list and print them separated by spaces.

3. **Analyzing `func_1(n, operations, queries)`:**
   - The function `func_1` is not provided, but we know it takes three parameters: `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.
   - The function returns a value `result`, which is a list of some kind.

4. **Constraints and Implications:**
   - Since `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`, and `_` is incremented by `n`, it implies that `t` is greater than the sum of all `n` values across all test cases.
   - This constraint ensures that the number of test cases `t` is valid and that the function `func_1` is called multiple times with different `n` and `q` values.

5. **Output Determination:**
   - The exact values in `result` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided.
   - However, based on the initial state, `result` is a list of values that are the results of processing `operations` and `queries` with the given `n`.

Given the lack of specific details about `func_1`, we can only describe the output in general terms:

Output: **[result elements] (where `result` is the list returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, and each element in `result` is the result of processing the corresponding `operations` and `queries` with the given `n`)**

This description indicates that the output will be the unpacked elements of the `result` list, which are the results of the function `func_1` for the given inputs.
