The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` was incremented by `n`, and `t` must be greater than the current value of `_` for the loop to execute again.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000
- `_` is incremented by `n`, and `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `_` must be incremented by `n` again, so the new value of `_` is `_ + n`
- `t` must still be greater than the new value of `_` for the loop to continue

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are specific positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, and the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from the input, `queries` is a list of integers from the input, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is incremented by `n` again, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`**.
