Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are specific positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from the input, `queries` is a list of integers read from the input, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is incremented by `n` again, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.**

Explanation:
- The code `queries = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `queries`.
- The initial state specifies that `queries` is a list of integers from the input, and after the code execution, `queries` is updated to a list of integers read from the new input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, `result`, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code snippet.
