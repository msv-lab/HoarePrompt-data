Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, and the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `n` and `q` are now assigned the values from the input.**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `q` are read from the input and assigned to the variables `n` and `q` respectively. The initial state constraints for `t`, `n`, and `q` remain valid, and the new values of `n` and `q` are now specified by the input.
