Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the second type of operation correctly. Specifically, the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` in `func_1` should append `x` copies of the array to itself, but it only appends one copy. This means that when the operation type is 2, the array is not being expanded as required by the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 10
1 1
1 2
2 1
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20
```
After the first three operations, the array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2]`. However, the fourth operation (1 3) should append 3 to the array, making it `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`. The fifth operation (2 3) should then append 3 copies of `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3]` to itself, resulting in:
```
[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]
```
However, the program will only append one copy, resulting in:
```
[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]
```
This discrepancy means the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
