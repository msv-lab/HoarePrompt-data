To determine what will be printed by the `print(*result)` statement, we need to understand the context and the values of the variables and objects involved based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This means `t` represents the number of test cases.
- `n` and `q` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, q \leq 10^5\). `n` represents the number of operations, and `q` represents the number of queries.
- The sum of `n` and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).
- `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from the input.
- `queries` is a list of integers.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

### Understanding the `print(*result)` Statement:
- The `*` operator in the `print` function is used to unpack the elements of the `result` list, so each element will be printed separated by spaces.

### Determining the Output:
- The `result` is the output of the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`. Since the function `func_1` is not provided, we can only infer the structure of the output based on the given information.
- Typically, such a function would process the `operations` and `queries` and return a list of results corresponding to each query.

### Example Scenario:
- Suppose `func_1` processes the `operations` to build some data structure (like a list or a dictionary) and then uses the `queries` to generate a list of results.
- For each query, `func_1` might return a specific value based on the operations performed.

### General Output:
- The `print(*result)` statement will print the elements of the `result` list separated by spaces.
- The exact values in `result` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, but we can describe the output in general terms.

### Final Output:
Output: **[result elements separated by spaces] (where each element is the result of processing the corresponding query based on the operations)**

This description indicates that the output will be a sequence of values, each corresponding to a query, and these values are determined by the operations performed in `func_1`.
