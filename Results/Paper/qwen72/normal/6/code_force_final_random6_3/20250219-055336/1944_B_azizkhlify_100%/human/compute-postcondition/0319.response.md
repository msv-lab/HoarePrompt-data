Postcondition: ***`res` is a list with all elements processed. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is set to `2 * n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and for each `i` in the range `n` to `2 * n - 1`, if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `r[a[i] - 1]` is now 0 and `ur` is incremented by 2 for each such occurrence. If `ul` was equal to `ur` at any point during the loop execution, the loop would have broken out early, and the values of `r[a[i] - 1]` and `ur` would remain as they were at that point. Otherwise, if `ul` is equal to `ur`, `i` remains undefined or retains its value from the precondition.***
