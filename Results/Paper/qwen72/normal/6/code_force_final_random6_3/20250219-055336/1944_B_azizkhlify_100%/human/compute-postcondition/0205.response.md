Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is `n + 2`.
- `r[a[n] - 1]` retains its original value.
- If `ul` is equal to `ur` and `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `ul` becomes `ur + 2` and `r[a[i] - 1]` becomes 0.
- Otherwise, if `ul` is equal to `ur`, `ul` retains its original value and `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged.
- If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `ul` and `r[a[i] - 1]` retain their original values.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is defined as `n + 2`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `i` will be at least 3 (if `n` is 1, `i` would be 3, but `n` is greater than 1, so `i` is at least 4).

2. **Determine the value of `a[i]`:**
   - The value of `a[i]` is not explicitly provided in the initial state. However, we know that `a` is a list and `i` is an index into this list. The value of `a[i]` will be the element at index `i` in the list `a`.

3. **Determine the value of `r[a[i] - 1]`:**
   - The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is not explicitly provided, but it is mentioned that if `ul` is equal to `ur` and `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `r[a[i] - 1]` becomes 0. Otherwise, `r[a[i] - 1]` retains its original value. However, this condition does not affect the `print` statement directly.

4. **Determine the value of `ul` and `ur`:**
   - The values of `ul` and `ur` are not explicitly provided, but they are mentioned in the conditions. The `print` statement does not directly depend on `ul` or `ur`.

5. **Evaluate the `print` statement:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `a` and `i` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables and their relationships.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i in the list a, and i is n + 2)**
