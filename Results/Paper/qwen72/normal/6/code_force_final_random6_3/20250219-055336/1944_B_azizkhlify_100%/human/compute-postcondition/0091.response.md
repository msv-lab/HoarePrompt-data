To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `res` must contain all the elements that were processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
   - `i` is the last element of `res` + 1.
   - `i` must be less than `2 * n`.

2. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `res` is a list of indices where `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `ul` and `ur` are distinct values.
   - `i` is the index just after the last element in `res`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

4. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `i` is the index just after the last element in `res`, which means `i` is the next index to be processed.
   - Since `i` is less than `2 * n`, it is a valid index in the list `a`.

5. **Output:**
   - The exact value of `a[i]` depends on the list `a` and the value of `i`.
   - Given the initial state, `i` is the next index to be processed, and `a[i]` is the element at that index.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i in the list a, and i is the last element of res + 1)**
