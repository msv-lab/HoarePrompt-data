The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `res`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `res`. If `res` has at least two elements, the loop will execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `res` must contain at least one element, and `i` is the first element of `res`. For the loop to execute one more time, `res` must contain at least two elements, and `i` will be the second element of `res`.

State: **`res` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `res`**
