Output State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `n` is an input integer, `_` is a variable that will be assigned a value from `int(input())` which must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `r` is a list of `n` zeros.**

The code snippet `r = [0] * n` initializes the variable `r` as a list of `n` zeros. The other variables (`a`, `k`, `n`, `_`, `l`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
