The code snippet `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` by 1. The value of `i` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0. Therefore, the index used is `a[n] - 1`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, the value at index `a[n] - 1` in list `r` is incremented by 1.**
