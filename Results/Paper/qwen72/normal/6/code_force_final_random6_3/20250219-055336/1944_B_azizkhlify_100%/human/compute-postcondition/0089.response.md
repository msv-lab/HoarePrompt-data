Postcondition: ***`res` must contain all the elements that were processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is the last element of `res`. If `ul` is equal to `ur` and `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
