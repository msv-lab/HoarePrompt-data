Postcondition: **`res` is a list with all elements processed, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ul` is not equal to `ur`, and `ul` is equal to `ur`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `ur` is updated to `ur + 2` and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0. Otherwise, the values of `ur` and `r[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, this means:
- `res` is a list with all elements processed.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `ul` is not equal to `ur` (this is the precondition, but it is overridden by the if condition).
- `ul` is now equal to `ur` (this is the if condition).
- If `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `ur` has been updated to `ur + 2` and `r[a[i] - 1]` is now set to 0.
- Otherwise, the values of `ur` and `r[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged.
