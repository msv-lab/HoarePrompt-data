Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`. If `ul` is equal to `ur` and `r[a[n] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is increased by 2, and `ul` is equal to `ur`. Otherwise, `r[a[n] - 1]` retains its original value, and `ul` is equal to `ur`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `r[a[n] - 1]` retains its original value.***
