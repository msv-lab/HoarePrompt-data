Output State: **`res` must contain all the elements that were processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is the last element of `res` + 2, and `i` must be less than `2 * n`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0.**

In natural language: The initial state remains unchanged except for the value of `r[a[i] - 1]`, which is now set to 0. The other conditions and variable values remain the same.
