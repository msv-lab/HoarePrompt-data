The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the second element of the list `res`, followed by a space. 

Since the initial state specifies that `res` must be a list with at least 2 elements, and `i` is the second element of `res`, the output will be the value of the second element of `res`.

Output: **[i] (where [i] is the second element of the list `res`)**
