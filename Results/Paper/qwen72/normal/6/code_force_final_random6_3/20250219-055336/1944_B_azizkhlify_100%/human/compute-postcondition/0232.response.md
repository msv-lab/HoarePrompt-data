The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `2 * n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1` and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `n + 2`. The loop condition `i < 2 * n` must still hold true for the next iteration, so `n + 2` must be less than `2 * n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n + 2`, the value at index `a[n + 1] - 1` in list `r` is incremented by 1.**
