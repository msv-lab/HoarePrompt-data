The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `res`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `res`. If `res` has at least three elements, the loop will execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `res` must contain at least two elements, and `i` is the second element in `res`. For the loop to execute one more time, `res` must have at least three elements, and `i` will be the third element in `res`.

State: **`res` must contain at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `res`**
