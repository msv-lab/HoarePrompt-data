To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the precondition and the code step by step:

### Precondition Analysis:
1. **`res` must contain all the elements that were processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1:**
   - This means `res` is a list of indices where the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` was true during some processing.
   
2. **`n` must be greater than 0:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   
3. **`ul` is not equal to `ur`:**
   - `ul` and `ur` are different values, but their exact values are not specified.
   
4. **`i` is the last element of `res` + 2:**
   - `i` is calculated by taking the last element in the list `res` and adding 2 to it.
   
5. **`i` must be less than `2 * n`:**
   - The value of `i` must be less than twice the value of `n`.

### Code Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```
- This statement prints the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is the last element of `res` + 2.
   - Since `res` contains indices where `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, `i` is derived from the last processed index in `res`.
   - Let's denote the last element of `res` as `last_res`. Then, `i = last_res + 2`.

2. **Check the condition `i < 2 * n`:**
   - This condition ensures that `i` is a valid index within the bounds of the list `a`.

3. **Determine the value of `a[i]`:**
   - `a[i]` is the element in the list `a` at the index `i`.
   - Since `i` is derived from `res` and `res` contains indices where `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, the value of `a[i]` is not explicitly known but it is an element in the list `a`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space. The exact value of `a[i]` is not known from the given information, but it is an element in the list `a` at the index `i`, where `i` is the last element of `res` + 2 and `i < 2 * n`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element in the list `a` at the index `i`, and `i` is the last element of `res` + 2, with `i < 2 * n`)**
