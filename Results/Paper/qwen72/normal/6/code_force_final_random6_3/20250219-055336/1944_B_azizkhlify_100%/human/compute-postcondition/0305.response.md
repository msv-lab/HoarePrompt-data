Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `res` is a list with all elements processed.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `ul` is not equal to `ur`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is defined as `n + 1`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 1, `i` will be at least 2 (if `n` is 1, `i` would be 2, but `n` is greater than 1, so `i` will be at least 3).

2. **List `a`**:
   - The list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state.
   - However, the code snippet is trying to access `a[i]`, which implies that `a` must have at least `i + 1` elements to avoid an `IndexError`.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i in the list a, and i is n + 1, with n being greater than 1)**
