To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the conditions provided. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`.
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of `n` zeros with the elements at indices `a[i] - 1` set to 0 for each `i` in the range `0` to `n-1` where `l[a[i] - 1]` was originally 2.
   - `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `n` to `2n-1`.
   - `re` is 0 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is not 1, otherwise `re` is 1.
   - `ul` is 2 times the number of elements in `a` that caused `l[a[i] - 1]` to be set to 0 (up to `k * 2`).
   - `ur` is 0.
   - `res` is an empty list if `l[a[i] - 1]` is not 1, otherwise `res` is a list containing the first element of `a` and the element at index `i` of `a`.
   - `i` is 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is not 1, otherwise `i` is 3.
   - If `re` is equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `k` is updated based on the value of `ul`.
   - `l` is a list of `n` zeros, modified based on the values in `a`.
   - `r` is a list of `n` zeros, modified based on the values in `a` in the second half of the range.
   - `re` is a flag that indicates whether `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.
   - `ul` is a count of elements in `a` that caused `l[a[i] - 1]` to be set to 0.
   - `ur` is 0 (not used in the print statement).
   - `res` is a list that is populated based on the value of `l[a[i] - 1]`.
   - `i` is determined based on the value of `l[a[i] - 1]`.

3. **Determining `i`:**
   - `i` is 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is not 1.
   - `i` is 3 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(a[i], end=' ')` will print the value of `a[i]` with a space at the end.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since `i` is determined based on the value of `l[a[i] - 1]`, we need to consider both cases:
     - If `l[a[2] - 1]` is not 1, then `i` is 2.
     - If `l[a[2] - 1]` is 1, then `i` is 3.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the value of `i` can be either 2 or 3. However, without the exact values of `a` and `l`, we can't determine the exact value of `i`. Therefore, we need to consider both possibilities:

- If `i` is 2, the output will be `a[2]`.
- If `i` is 3, the output will be `a[3]`.

Since we don't have the exact values of `a` and `l`, we can't determine which one of these will be printed. However, based on the given conditions, the output will be one of these two values.

Output: **a[2] or a[3] (where a[2] is the third element of the list a and a[3] is the fourth element of the list a)**
