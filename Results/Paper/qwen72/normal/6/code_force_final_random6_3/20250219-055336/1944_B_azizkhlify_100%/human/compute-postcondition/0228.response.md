The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range of the loop is from `n` to `2 * n`, which means it will start at `n` and stop before `2 * n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at `n`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`**
