Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `n` to `2n-1`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is equal to 2.**
