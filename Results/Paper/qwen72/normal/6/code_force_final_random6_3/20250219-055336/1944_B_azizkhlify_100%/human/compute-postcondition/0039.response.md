Output State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[0] - 1` set to 0 if `l[a[0] - 1]` was originally 2, and the element at index `a[1] - 1` set to 0 if `l[a[1] - 1]` was originally 2, and the element at index `a[2] - 1` is now set to 0, otherwise `l` remains unchanged. `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `n` to `2n-1`. `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 if `l[a[0] - 1]` was originally 2 or if `l[a[1] - 1]` was originally 2, otherwise `ul` remains 0. `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 2. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement.**
