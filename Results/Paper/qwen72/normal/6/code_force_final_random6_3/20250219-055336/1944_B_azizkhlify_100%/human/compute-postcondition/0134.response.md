Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element `r[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by the number of times `a[j]` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 2, `ur` is 0, and `ul` is equal to `k * 2`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `l[a[0] - 1]` is set to 0.**
