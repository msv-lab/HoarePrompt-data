The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. However, the initial state provided indicates that `i` is `2 * n`, which is not consistent with the loop head where `i` starts from 0 and iterates up to `n-1`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state so that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
