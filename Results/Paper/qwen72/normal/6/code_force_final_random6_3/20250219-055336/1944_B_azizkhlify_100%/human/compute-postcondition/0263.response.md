Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- The element at the index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The value of `i` is given as 0.
2. **Variable `a[i]`**: Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` refers to the first element of the list `a`. Let's denote this element as `a[0]`.
3. **List `l`**: The initial state mentions that the element at the index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 1. This means that `a[0]` must be a valid index for the list `l` and that the element at this index is 1. However, the exact value of `a[0]` is not provided, but we know it is an integer greater than 0 (since `a[0] - 1` must be a valid index).

### Output Calculation:
- The `print` statement will print the value of `a[0]` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since the exact value of `a[0]` is not provided, we can only describe it based on the given information. The value of `a[0]` is an integer greater than 0, and the element at the index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 1.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[0] (where a[0] is an integer greater than 0)**
