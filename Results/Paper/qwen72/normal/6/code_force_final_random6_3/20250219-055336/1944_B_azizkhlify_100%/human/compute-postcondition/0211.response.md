Output State: **After all iterations, `i` is `2 * n - 1`, and `res` contains all elements added during the loop execution. If `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2 for any `i` in the range `[n, 2 * n)`, then `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, and `ur` is increased by 2 for each occurrence. If at any point `ul` becomes equal to `ur`, the loop breaks, and `ul` and `ur` retain their values at that point. Otherwise, `ul` remains unchanged and is not equal to `ur`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`, so after all iterations, `i` will be `2 * n - 1`.
- The list `res` will contain all elements added during the loop execution, as specified in the initial state.
- For each `i` in the range `[n, 2 * n)`, if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, it is set to 0, and `ur` is increased by 2.
- If at any point `ul` becomes equal to `ur`, the loop breaks immediately, and `ul` and `ur` retain their values at that point.
- If the loop completes without `ul` becoming equal to `ur`, `ul` remains unchanged and is not equal to `ur`.
