Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element `l[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by the number of times `a[j]` appears in the list `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[n] - 1]` is incremented by 1 and `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 2, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.
- Since `i` is `n + 2`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` was already incremented by 1 in the initial state, it is now incremented by an additional 1, making the total increment 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
