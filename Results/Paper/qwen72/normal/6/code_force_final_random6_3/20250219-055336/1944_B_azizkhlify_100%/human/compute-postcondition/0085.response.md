Output State: **`res` must contain all the elements that were processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is the last element of `res`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, `ur` is increased by 2.**

The value of `ur` is incremented by 2, while the values of `res`, `n`, `ul`, `i`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged. The condition that `ul` is not equal to `ur` is still valid, as `ur` has been increased.
