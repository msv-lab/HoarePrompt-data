Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `l` is a list of `n` integers.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element `r[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by the number of times `a[j]` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`.
- `re` is 0.
- `ur` is 0.
- `ul` is 0 or 2 depending on the initial value of `l[a[1] - 1]`.
- If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ul` remains 0 or 2 as it was before the condition check.

### Print Statement:
```
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is printing the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- The value of `i` is 2, so we are printing `a[2]` twice.

### Output:
- Since `i` is 2, the print statement will print the value of `a[2]` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **a[2] a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list `a`)**
