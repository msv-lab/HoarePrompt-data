Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates the maximum number of elements that can be removed from the list `a` such that the remaining list has no consecutive equal elements. The result for each test case is printed as the maximum of 0 and the calculated number of removable elements. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. **
