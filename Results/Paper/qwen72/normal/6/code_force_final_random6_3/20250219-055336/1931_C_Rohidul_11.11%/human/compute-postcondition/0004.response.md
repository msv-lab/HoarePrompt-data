Output State: **`_` is a temporary variable, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1, `st` is 0, `end` is 0.**

The variables `st` and `end` are both assigned the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged: `_` is still a temporary variable, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10,000, `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n` - 1.
