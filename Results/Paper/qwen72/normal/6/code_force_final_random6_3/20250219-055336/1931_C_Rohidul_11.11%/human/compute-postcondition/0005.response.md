To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to consider the conditions in the loop head: `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

1. **Condition `l < r`**:
   - Right before the loop, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`.
   - For `l < r` to be true, `r` must be greater than 0. Since `r` is `n - 1`, this means `n` must be greater than 1.

2. **Condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]`**:
   - Right before the loop, `l` is 0, so we need to check if `a[0] == a[1]`.
   - This condition depends on the values in the list `a`, which are provided by the user. We cannot adjust the values of `a`, but we can ensure that the list has at least two elements to make the comparison valid.

Given these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 1 and the list `a` has at least two elements. However, since we cannot adjust the list `a` itself, we focus on the variables `l` and `r`.

State: **`_` is a temporary variable, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is equal to `t` and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1, `st` is 0, `end` is 0**
