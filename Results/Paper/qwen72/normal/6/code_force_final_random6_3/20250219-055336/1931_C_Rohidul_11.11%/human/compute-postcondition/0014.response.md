Output State: **`_` is a temporary variable, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to `a[l + 1]` or `r` if all elements are equal, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal, `end` is 0.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the variable `l` will point to the first index in the list `a` where the element is not equal to the next element, or it will be equal to `r` if all elements in the list are equal. The variable `st` will contain the count of how many consecutive elements from the beginning of the list `a` are equal. The variables `t`, `n`, and `end` remain unchanged, and `r` is still `n - 1`.
