Output State: **`_` is a temporary variable, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least two elements and the last two elements are equal, `l` is less than `r` or `r` is equal to `l`, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to `a[r + 1]` or `l` if all elements from `l` to `r` are equal, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, `ans` is equal to `len(a) - 1`.**

The code snippet `ans = len(a) - 1` assigns the value of `len(a) - 1` to the variable `ans`. The length of the list `a` is reduced by 1 to get the value of `ans`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
