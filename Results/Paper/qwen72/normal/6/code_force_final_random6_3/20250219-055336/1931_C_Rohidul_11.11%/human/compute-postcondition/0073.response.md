Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer and `n >= 5`, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`, and so on until `a[l - 1]` must be equal to `a[l]`, if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`, if `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and `st` is 0, then `end` is 0 and `ans` is the length of `a` minus 1, otherwise, `st` is `l`, `end` is the number of times the loop executed, and `ans` is `r - l`.**
