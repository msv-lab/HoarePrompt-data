Output State: **`_` is a temporary variable, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least two elements and the last two elements are equal, `l` is less than `r` or `r` is equal to `l`, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to `a[r + 1]` or `l` if all elements from `l` to `r` are equal, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal, `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the variable `r` will be the index of the last element in the list `a` that is not equal to the element immediately before it. If all elements from `l` to `r` are equal, `r` will be equal to `l`. The variable `end` will count the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal. The other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `st`) will remain unchanged from their initial values.
