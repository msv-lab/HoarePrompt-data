Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is the largest index such that `a[l] == a[l + 1]` for all `l < r` and `l` is at least 3, `r` is `n - 1` and `r` must be greater than `l`, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`, and so on until `a[l - 1]` must be equal to `a[l]`, `st` is `l`, `end` is 0, `ans` is the difference `r - l`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the variable `l` will be the largest index where `a[l]` is equal to `a[l + 1]` for all indices from 0 to `l - 1`. The variable `st` will be equal to `l`, and `ans` will be the difference between `r` and `l`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `end` remain unchanged. The loop will stop when `l` is no longer less than `r` or when `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l + 1]`.
