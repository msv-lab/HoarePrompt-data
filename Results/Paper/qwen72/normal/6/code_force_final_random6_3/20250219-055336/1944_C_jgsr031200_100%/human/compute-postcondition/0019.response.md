Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` corresponds to the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`. `cou` is 1 if `freq[i]` is 1, otherwise `cou` remains 0. `n` must be at least 0, and `i` is 0. The current value of `freq[i]` is either 1 or greater than or equal to 2. If `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
