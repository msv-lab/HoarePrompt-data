The `break` statement causes the program to exit the current loop or conditional block it is inside. The values of the variables `arr`, `freq`, `cou`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The conditions specified in the initial state still hold true.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` corresponds to the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`. `cou` is 1 if `freq[i]` is 1, otherwise `cou` remains 0. `n` must be at least 0, and `i` is 0. The current value of `freq[i]` is either 1 or greater than or equal to 2. Additionally, either `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
