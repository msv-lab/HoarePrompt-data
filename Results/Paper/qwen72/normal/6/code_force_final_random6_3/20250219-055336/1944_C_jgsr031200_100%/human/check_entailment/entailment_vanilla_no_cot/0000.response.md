Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each element in the array `arr` using a list `freq` where `freq[i]` represents the number of occurrences of the integer `i` in `arr`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The game's score is determined by the MEX of the array `c` after all elements have been removed from `a`. Alice and Bob play optimally:
   - Alice wants to maximize the score, so she will try to include as many unique elements as possible in `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the score, so he will try to prevent Alice from including unique elements in `c`.

4. **MEX Calculation**: The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c` by iterating through the `freq` list. It keeps track of the number of unique elements (`cou`) that have been included in `c`:
   - If `freq[i] >= 2`, it means there are at least two occurrences of `i` in `arr`, so Alice can always pick one and Bob can pick the other, and `i` will not be the MEX.
   - If `freq[i] == 1`, it means there is exactly one occurrence of `i` in `arr`, and Alice will try to include it in `c` if possible.
   - If `cou == 2`, it means that Alice has included two unique elements in `c`, and the next smallest integer that is not in `c` will be the MEX.
   - If `freq[i] == 0`, it means `i` is not in `arr`, and thus it is the MEX.

5. **Output**: The program prints the MEX for each test case, which is the correct output based on the problem description.

The program follows the optimal strategy for both players and correctly calculates the MEX for the final array `c`. Therefore, the program is correct.
