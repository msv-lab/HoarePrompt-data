The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 2, and `n` must be at least 1 (since `i` must be less than `n + 1`).

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` corresponds to the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`. `n` must be at least 1, and `i` is 2. `cou` remains 1.**
