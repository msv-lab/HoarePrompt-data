The value of `freq[i]` is incremented by 1. The variable `i` is the first element of `arr`, and `freq` is assumed to be a list or dictionary that tracks the frequency of elements in `arr`. The initial state of `arr` being a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` being between 1 and 2 * 10^5, remains unchanged. The value of `i` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is incremented by 1.**
