Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `freq[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the second element of `arr`. The initial state conditions for `arr` and `i` remain unchanged.
