Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. The function `func_1` only checks the frequency of elements in the array `arr` and prints the first index where the frequency is less than 2 or 0. This approach does not consider the strategic choices that Alice and Bob would make to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c` respectively.

The provided counterexample is valid and demonstrates that the program's output is incorrect for the given input. The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob would result in a different MEX, as shown in the step-by-step optimal game play. The program fails to account for the dynamic nature of the game and the strategic decisions that each player would make based on the current state of the array `a`.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
