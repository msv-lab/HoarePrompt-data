Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` corresponds to the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`. `cou` is 0, `n` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
