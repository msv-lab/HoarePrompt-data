Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` corresponds to the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`. `cou` is 0.**

The variable `cou` has been initialized to 0, and no other variables have been affected. The initial conditions for `arr` and `freq` remain unchanged.
