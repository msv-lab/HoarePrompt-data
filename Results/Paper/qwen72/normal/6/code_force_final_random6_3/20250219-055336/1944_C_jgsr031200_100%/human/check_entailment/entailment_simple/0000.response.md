### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a frequency list `freq` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - It then iterates over `arr` and increments the corresponding index in `freq` for each element in `arr`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.
   - Alice and Bob play optimally, so Alice will try to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it.
   - The key insight is that if an integer appears at least twice in `arr`, it can be ignored because Alice can always pick it, and Bob will not be able to prevent it from being in `c`.
   - The program correctly identifies this by checking if `freq[i] >= 2` and continuing the loop if true.
   - If an integer appears exactly once, it is a candidate for the MEX. The program counts such unique integers using `cou`.
   - If `cou` reaches 2, it means there are two unique integers, and the smallest one will be the MEX.
   - If `freq[i] == 0`, it means the integer `i` is not present in `arr`, and it will be the MEX.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the smallest integer `i` that is either not present in `arr` or is the second unique integer encountered.

### Analysis of the Code:
- The program correctly handles the input and calculates the frequency of each integer.
- The logic for determining the MEX is sound and follows the optimal strategy for both players.
- The program ensures that it prints the correct MEX based on the conditions described.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. It correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
