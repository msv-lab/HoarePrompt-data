The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, and the loop is controlled by the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input provided must be greater than 0. The state before the loop starts should ensure that the input is a positive integer, which will determine the number of iterations the loop will perform.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
