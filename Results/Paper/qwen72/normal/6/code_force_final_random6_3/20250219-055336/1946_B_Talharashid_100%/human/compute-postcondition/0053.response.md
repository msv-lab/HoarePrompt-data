Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `c` is the sum of the non-negative elements of `l` from the last negative element (or from the start if no negative element is encountered) to the end of the list, and `maxi` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subsequence of non-negative elements in `l` that does not include a negative element whose absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- `i` remains 1.
- `n` and `k` remain as the integers provided by the user, both greater than 1.
- `l` remains the list of integers input by the user, with at least `n` elements.
- `c` is the sum of the non-negative elements from the last negative element encountered (or from the start if no negative element is encountered) to the end of the list.
- `maxi` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subsequence of non-negative elements in `l` that does not include a negative element whose absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`.
