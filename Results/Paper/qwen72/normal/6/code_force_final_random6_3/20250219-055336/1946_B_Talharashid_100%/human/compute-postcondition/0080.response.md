Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, and `ele` is the third element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, and `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.***
