The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ele` and the list `l`. The loop iterates over the elements of the list `l`, and for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the list `l` after the current element `ele`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, and `ele` is the first element in the list `l`. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must have at least 2 elements, and `ele` will be the second element in the list `l`.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If `ele` < 0 and `c` <= `abs(ele)`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `ele` and 0.**
