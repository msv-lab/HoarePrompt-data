Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, and `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of the original `maxi` and the updated `c`.***
