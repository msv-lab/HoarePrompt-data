The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ele` and the list `l`. For the loop to execute, the list `l` must contain at least one element. The variable `ele` will take the value of the first element in the list `l` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`**
