The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range value `10`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute 10 times regardless of the values of `t`, `_`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`, and `total`. However, to ensure the loop starts, we need to set the initial state of `i` to 0, which is the starting point for the range.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each representing a value of `n` that was read during the loop execution, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
