Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). It computes a list `values` where each element `values[i]` is the sum of the values of the last digit and the remainder of the number `i` (for i ≥ 10). It also computes a list `sum_values` where each element `sum_values[i]` is the cumulative sum of the `values` list up to index `i`. Finally, for each test case, it prints the cumulative sum of the `values` list up to the corresponding `n`. The function does not return any value, but it outputs the results for each test case to the console. **
