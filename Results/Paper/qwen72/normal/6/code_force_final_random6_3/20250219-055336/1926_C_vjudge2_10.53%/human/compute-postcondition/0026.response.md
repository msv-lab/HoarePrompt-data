Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except `values[0]` which is 0, `values[1]` which is 1, and `values[2]` which is 2, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 3, `i` is 2, `sum_values[1]` is 1, `sum_values[0]` is 0, `sum_values[2]` is 3**

Explanation: The code snippet `sum_values[i] = total` assigns the value of `total` (which is 3) to the element at index `i` (which is 2) in the list `sum_values`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `sum_values[2]` is now 3.
