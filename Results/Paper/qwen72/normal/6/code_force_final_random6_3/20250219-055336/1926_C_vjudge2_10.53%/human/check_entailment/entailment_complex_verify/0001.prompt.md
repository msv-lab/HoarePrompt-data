You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) provided before the individual test cases.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). It computes a list `values` where each element `values[i]` is the sum of the values of the last digit and the remainder of the number `i` (for i ≥ 10). It also computes a list `sum_values` where each element `sum_values[i]` is the cumulative sum of the `values` list up to index `i`. Finally, for each test case, it prints the cumulative sum of the `values` list up to the corresponding `n`. The function does not return any value, but it outputs the results for each test case to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers `n` from the input. This is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, are initialized to store the sum of digits for each number and the cumulative sum of these values, respectively. This is a good approach to avoid recalculating the sum of digits for each number multiple times.

3. **Base Case**:
   - The first 10 values in `values` and `sum_values` are set correctly. For numbers from 1 to 9, the sum of digits is the number itself, and the cumulative sum is calculated correctly.

4. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - The function uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the sum of digits for numbers greater than 9.
   - For each number `i` from 10 to `n`, it converts the number to a string to extract the last digit and the remainder of the number when the last digit is removed.
   - The sum of digits for `i` is calculated as the sum of the last digit and the sum of digits of the remainder.
   - The cumulative sum `sum_values[i]` is then updated by adding the current value `values[i]` to the previous cumulative sum `sum_values[i - 1]`.

5. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the function prints the cumulative sum of the sum of digits for the number `n`.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The function processes each number from 1 to `n` exactly once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n). This should be sufficient given the constraints (n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and t ≤ 10^4).

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is less than 10 correctly by using the precomputed values.
   - It also handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly, as the base case is set up to handle this.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct and efficient. It correctly calculates the sum of the digits for each number and the cumulative sum for each test case. The approach is sound and should work within the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
