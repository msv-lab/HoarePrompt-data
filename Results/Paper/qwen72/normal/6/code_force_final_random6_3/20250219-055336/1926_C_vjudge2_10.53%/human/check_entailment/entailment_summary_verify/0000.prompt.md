You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())

    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). It computes a list `values` where each element `values[i]` is the sum of the values of the last digit and the remainder of the number `i` (for i ≥ 10). It also computes a list `sum_values` where each element `sum_values[i]` is the cumulative sum of the `values` list up to index `i`. Finally, for each test case, it prints the cumulative sum of the `values` list up to the corresponding `n`. The function does not return any value, but it outputs the results for each test case to the console.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the way it calculates the sum of the digits for numbers greater than 9. Specifically, the line `remainder = int(word[:-1])` does not correctly handle the sum of the digits for multi-digit numbers. For example, for the number 100, `remainder` would be 10, and the program would treat it as a single digit, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which will cause a runtime error. 

To illustrate, consider the input `n = 100`:
- The program will incorrectly calculate the sum of the digits for 100 as `values[0] + values[10]`, which is 0 + 1 = 1, instead of the correct sum of digits 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
- However, the sum of the digits for 100 should be 1, but the program will not correctly accumulate the sum for all numbers up to 100 due to the incorrect handling of multi-digit numbers.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
