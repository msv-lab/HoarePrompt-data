Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each representing a value of `n` that was read during the loop execution, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except `values[0]` which is 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `values[0]` is set to 0.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- The initial state conditions are still valid.
