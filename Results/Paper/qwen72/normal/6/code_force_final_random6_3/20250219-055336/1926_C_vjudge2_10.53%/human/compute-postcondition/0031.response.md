The code snippet `remainder = int(word[:-1])` extracts all characters from the string `word` except the last one, converts the resulting substring to an integer, and assigns this value to the variable `remainder`.

Given the initial state:
- `word` is '10'

The substring `word[:-1]` is '1', and `int('1')` is 1. Therefore, `remainder` is assigned the value 1.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, and 45 respectively, `total` is 45, `i` is 10, `n` must be at least 9, `word` is '10', `last` is 0, `remainder` is 1.**
