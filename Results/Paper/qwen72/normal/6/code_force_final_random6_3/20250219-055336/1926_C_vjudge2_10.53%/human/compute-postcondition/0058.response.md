The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `n`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `n` is an integer representing the largest number Vladislav writes, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function processes each test case and returns the result for each case.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `t` and `n`. `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `n` is the largest number Vladislav writes (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the value of `n`.**
