You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` should actually be defined with an input parameter `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) provided before the individual test cases.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        numbers.append(n)
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each representing a value of `n` that was read during the loop execution.
    values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    sum_values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        
        total += i
        
        sum_values[i] = total
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, and 45 respectively, `total` is 45, `i` is 9.
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively, and the elements from 10 to `n` are the computed values based on the loop logic. `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, and 45 respectively, and the elements from 10 to `n` are the cumulative sums of the `values` list up to that index. `total` is 45, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 9, and all other variables remain unchanged.
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively, and the elements from 10 to `max(numbers)` are the computed values based on the loop logic, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, and 45 respectively, and the elements from 10 to `max(numbers)` are the cumulative sums of the `values` list up to that index, `total` is 45, `i` is the last value of `n` in `numbers`, `n` is the last value of `n` in `numbers`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `t` and `n`. `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `n` is the largest number Vladislav writes (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the value of `n`.
