Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except `values[0]` which is 0 and `values[1]` which is 1, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 1, `i` is 1, `sum_values[1]` is 1, `sum_values[0]` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `sum_values[i] = total` assigns the value of `total` (which is 1) to the element at index `i` (which is 1) in the list `sum_values`.
- The initial state specifies that `sum_values[0]` is 0, and this remains unchanged.
- The value of `sum_values[1]` is now 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain the same as they were in the initial state.
