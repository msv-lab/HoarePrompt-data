### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers `n` from the input. This is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, are initialized to store the sum of digits for each number and the cumulative sum of these values, respectively. This is a good approach to avoid recalculating the sum of digits for each number multiple times.

3. **Base Case**:
   - The first 10 values in `values` and `sum_values` are set correctly. For numbers from 1 to 9, the sum of digits is the number itself, and the cumulative sum is calculated correctly.

4. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - The function uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the sum of digits for numbers greater than 9.
   - For each number `i` from 10 to `n`, it converts the number to a string to extract the last digit and the remainder of the number when the last digit is removed.
   - The sum of digits for `i` is calculated as the sum of the last digit and the sum of digits of the remainder.
   - The cumulative sum `sum_values[i]` is then updated by adding the current value `values[i]` to the previous cumulative sum `sum_values[i - 1]`.

5. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the function prints the cumulative sum of the sum of digits for the number `n`.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The function processes each number from 1 to `n` exactly once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n). This should be sufficient given the constraints (n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and t ≤ 10^4).

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is less than 10 correctly by using the precomputed values.
   - It also handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly, as the base case is set up to handle this.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct and efficient. It correctly calculates the sum of the digits for each number and the cumulative sum for each test case. The approach is sound and should work within the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
