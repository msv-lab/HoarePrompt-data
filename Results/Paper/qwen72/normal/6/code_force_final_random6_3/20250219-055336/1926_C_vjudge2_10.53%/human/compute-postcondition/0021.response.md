Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except `values[0]` which is 0 and `values[1]` which is 1, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 1, `i` is 1, `sum_values[0]` is 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is 1. Therefore, `total` is now 1.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The value of `sum_values[0]` remains 0.
- All other conditions from the initial state remain valid.
