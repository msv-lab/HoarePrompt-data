The value of `sum_values[i]` is updated to `sum_total`. Given that `i` is 10 and `sum_total` is 54, `sum_values[10]` is now 54. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, and 45 respectively, `sum_values[10]` is 54, `total` is 45, `i` is 10, `n` must be at least 9, `word` is '10', `last` is 0, `remainder` is 1, `values[10]` is 9, `sum_total` is 54.**
