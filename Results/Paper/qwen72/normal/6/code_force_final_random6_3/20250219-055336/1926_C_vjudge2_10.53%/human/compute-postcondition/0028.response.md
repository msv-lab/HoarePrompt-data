To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:
```
for i in range(10, n + 1):
```
The variables and objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 10, and it will iterate as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. Therefore, `i` should be 10 at the start of the loop.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n + 1` is greater than 10, which means `n` must be at least 9 for the loop to run at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `_` is `t-1`
- `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers
- `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively
- `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, and 45 respectively
- `total` is 45
- `i` is 9

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to set `i` to 10 and ensure `n` is at least 9.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, and 45 respectively, `total` is 45, `i` is 10, `n` must be at least 9**
