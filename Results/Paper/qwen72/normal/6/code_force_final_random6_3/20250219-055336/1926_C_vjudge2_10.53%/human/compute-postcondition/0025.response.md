Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except `values[0]` which is 0, `values[1]` which is 1, and `values[2]` which is 2, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 3, `i` is 2, `sum_values[1]` is 1, `sum_values[0]` is 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `i`.
- Initially, `total` is 1 and `i` is 2, so `total` becomes 3.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
