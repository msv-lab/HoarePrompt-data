Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each representing a value of `n` that was read during the loop execution, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros.**

The code initializes a new list `sum_values` with the same length as `values`, which is `max(numbers) + 1`, and sets all elements in `sum_values` to zero. The other variables remain unchanged.
