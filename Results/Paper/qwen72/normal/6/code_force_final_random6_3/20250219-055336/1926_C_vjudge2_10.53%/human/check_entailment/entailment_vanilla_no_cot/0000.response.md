Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Range for `n` in the Main Loop**:
   - The loop `for i in range(10, n + 1):` should be `for i in range(10, max(numbers) + 1):` because `n` is the current test case number, not the maximum number across all test cases. This is important because the `values` and `sum_values` arrays need to be populated up to the maximum number in the test cases.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `remainder`**:
   - The calculation `remainder = int(word[:-1])` is incorrect because it can lead to incorrect values for `remainder`. For example, if `i = 100`, `word[:-1]` will be `"10"`, and `remainder` will be `10`, which is not the correct remainder when `100` is divided by 10. Instead, you should use `remainder = i // 10`.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of `values[i]`**:
   - The calculation `values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]` is incorrect because `last` is the last digit of `i`, and `remainder` is the number formed by the digits of `i` except the last one. However, the sum of the digits of `i` should be `last + sum_of_digits(remainder)`, not `values[last] + values[remainder]`.

4. **Performance Concern**:
   - The program may not meet the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case, especially for large values of `n` (up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\)). The current approach has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is inefficient.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues and is more efficient:

```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    max_n = 0
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_n = max(max_n, n)
        results.append(n)
    
    values = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    sum_values = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):
        values[i] = sum_of_digits(i)
        sum_values[i] = sum_values[i - 1] + values[i]
    
    for n in results:
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Sum of Digits Function**:
   - `sum_of_digits(n)` is a helper function that calculates the sum of the digits of `n`.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and the numbers `n` for each test case, storing them in `results` and finding the maximum `n` in `max_n`.

3. **Precomputation**:
   - The program precomputes the sum of digits for all numbers from 1 to `max_n` and stores them in `values`.
   - It also precomputes the cumulative sum of these values in `sum_values`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints the precomputed sum of the digits for the number `n`.

This approach ensures that the program is efficient and meets the time limit requirements.
