Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, and 45 respectively, `sum_values[10]` is 54, `sum_values[11]` is 64, `total` is 45, `i` is 12, `n` must be at least 12, `word` is '12', `last` is 2, `remainder` is 12, `values[12]` is 11, `sum_total` is 75.**

Explanation:
- `sum_total` is assigned the value of `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`.
- `i` is 12, so `values[12]` is 11.
- `i - 1` is 11, so `sum_values[11]` is 64.
- Therefore, `sum_total` is 11 + 64 = 75.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
