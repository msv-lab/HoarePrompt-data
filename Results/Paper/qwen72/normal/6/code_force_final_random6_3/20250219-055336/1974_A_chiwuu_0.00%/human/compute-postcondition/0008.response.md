Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer representing the first value input by the user, `b` is an integer representing the second value input by the user, `t` is now equal to `b * 2`, and `t` is not divisible by 5.**
