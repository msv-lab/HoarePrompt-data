Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1`.***
