Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer representing the first value input by the user, `b` is an integer representing the second value input by the user.**

The code snippet `b = int(b)` converts the string `b` to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Now, `b` holds an integer value, and the initial conditions for `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, and `a` still hold true.
