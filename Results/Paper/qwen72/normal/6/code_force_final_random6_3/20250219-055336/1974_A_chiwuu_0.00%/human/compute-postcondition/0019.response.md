Output State: **`t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`, `t2` is not divisible by 15, `i` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer representing the first value input by the user, `b` is an integer representing the second value input by the user.**

Explanation:
- `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.
- The values of `t1` and `t2` are not directly changed by the code, but they are still valid as per their initial conditions.
- `i` remains 0.
- `x` and `y` remain integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` remain the integers representing the first and second values input by the user, respectively.
