### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the number of 1x1 icons `a` and the number of 2x2 icons `b`.

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons using `t = b * 2`. This is incorrect. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a screen has 15 cells. Therefore, the number of screens required for 2x2 icons should be calculated based on the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons, not just the number of rows they occupy.
   - The correct calculation should be `t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15` to account for the total cells occupied by 2x2 icons and to handle partial screens correctly.

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells:**
   - The program calculates the total number of cells used by the 2x2 icons as `b * 4`.
   - It then calculates the number of remaining cells on the screens already used by the 2x2 icons as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This part is correct.

4. **Checking if Remaining Cells are Sufficient for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`t1 >= a`), the program does not need to add any more screens.
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the program calculates the additional number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - The calculation `t2 = a - t1` is correct, as it determines how many more 1x1 icons need to be placed.
   - The program then checks if `t2` is divisible by 15 (the total number of cells in a screen). If it is, it adds `t2 // 15` screens. If not, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1` screens to account for the partial screen. This part is correct.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is incorrect. The program should calculate the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons and then determine the number of screens needed based on that.
- The logic for calculating the remaining cells and checking if they are sufficient for 1x1 icons is correct.
- The logic for calculating additional screens needed for 1x1 icons is correct.

### Potential Issues:
- The incorrect calculation of `t` for 2x2 icons can lead to incorrect results, especially when the number of 2x2 icons is large enough to require more than one screen.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described due to the incorrect calculation of the number of screens required for 2x2 icons. The logic for handling 1x1 icons and the remaining cells is correct, but the initial calculation of screens for 2x2 icons is flawed.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
