Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer representing the first value input by the user, `b` is an integer representing the second value input by the user, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1.***
