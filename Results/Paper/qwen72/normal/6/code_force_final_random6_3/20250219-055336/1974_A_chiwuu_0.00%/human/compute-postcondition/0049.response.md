Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`**

The value of `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, where `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`. Therefore, `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
