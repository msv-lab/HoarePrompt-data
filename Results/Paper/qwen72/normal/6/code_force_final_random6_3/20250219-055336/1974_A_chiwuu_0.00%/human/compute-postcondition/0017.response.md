Output State: **`t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`, `t2` is divisible by 15, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers representing the first and second values input by the user, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, and since `t2` is divisible by 15, `t2 // 15` is an integer.
- `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`.
- The values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The conditions `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4` and `t1` is less than `a` still hold.
- The condition that `t2` is divisible by 15 still holds.
