Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer representing the first value input by the user, `b` is an integer representing the second value input by the user, `t` is now equal to `b * 2 // 5`.**

Explanation:
- `t` was initially equal to `b * 2` and was divisible by 5.
- After executing `t = t // 5`, `t` is now `b * 2 // 5`.
- Since `t` was originally between 1 and 10,000 and was divisible by 5, `t` after the operation will be between 1 and 2000.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
