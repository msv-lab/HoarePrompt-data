Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is `(b * 2) // 5`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1 < a`, then `t2` is `a - t1`, and if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`. If `t2 % 15 != 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1`.**
