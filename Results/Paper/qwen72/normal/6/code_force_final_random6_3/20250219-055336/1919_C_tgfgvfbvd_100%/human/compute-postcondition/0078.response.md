Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
2. `_` is 1.
3. `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
4. `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
5. `x` is `n-1`.
6. `a` is the smallest integer in `l`.
7. `b` is the second smallest integer in `l` (if it exists).
8. `c` is the count of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(c)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input for `n`**:
   - The user provides an integer `n` which must be greater than 0.

2. **List `l`**:
   - The user provides a list of integers `l`.

3. **Variable `x`**:
   - `x` is calculated as `n-1`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `x` will be a non-negative integer.

4. **Variable `a`**:
   - `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`.

5. **Variable `b`**:
   - `b` is the second smallest integer in the list `l`, if it exists. If the list `l` has fewer than 2 elements, `b` will not exist.

6. **Variable `c`**:
   - `c` is the count of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.
   - If `b` does not exist (i.e., the list has fewer than 2 elements), `c` will be 0 because there are no integers to compare with both `a` and `b`.

### Final Output:
- The `print(c)` statement will print the value of `c`, which is the count of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.
- If the list `l` has fewer than 2 elements, `c` will be 0.

Output: **c (where c is the count of integers in `l` that are greater than both the smallest integer `a` and the second smallest integer `b` in `l`, or 0 if `l` has fewer than 2 elements)**
