The only objects in the loop head are variables `x` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x` being less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `x` is 1.
- `c` is 0 or 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `x` must be incremented by 1, so `x` becomes 2.
- `n` must remain greater than `x` for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 2, and `c` is 0 or 1.**
