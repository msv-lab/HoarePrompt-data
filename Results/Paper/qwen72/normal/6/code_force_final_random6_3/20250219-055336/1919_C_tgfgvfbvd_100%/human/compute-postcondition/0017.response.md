Postcondition: ***`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 0. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is the element at index `x` in `l`, `a` is equal to `b`, and `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is equal to `l[x]`, `b` is infinity, and `c` is 1. In both cases, the element at index `x` in `l` is greater than `a` and the condition `a` > `b` is not possible.***
