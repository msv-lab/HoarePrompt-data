Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 1, `a` is updated to `l[1]`, `b` remains infinity, and `c` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = l[x]` updates the value of `a` to the value at index `x` in the list `l`.
- Since `x` is 1, `a` is updated to `l[1]`.
- The value of `b` remains infinity.
- The value of `c` remains 0, as the conditions for changing `c` to 1 are not met by this code snippet.
- The values of `int(input())`, `_`, `n`, and `l` are not affected by this code snippet.
