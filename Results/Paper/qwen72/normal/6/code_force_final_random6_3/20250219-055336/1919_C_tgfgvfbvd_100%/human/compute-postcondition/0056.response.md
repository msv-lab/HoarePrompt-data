Postcondition: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 0, and `c` is 0 or 1. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is set to `l[0]` and `a` remains `float('inf')`. If `l[0]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is set to `l[0]` and `b` remains `float('inf')`. In both cases, if `a` > `b`, then `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is equal to `a`. The first element of `l` (i.e., `l[0]`) is greater than `a` if `c` is 1, otherwise, it is less than or equal to `b`.**
