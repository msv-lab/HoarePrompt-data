Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array into two subsequences. The issue lies in the way the program updates the values of `a` and `b` and counts the penalty `c`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The expected output is `3` because the optimal way to split the array is to have one subsequence as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the other as `[]`. The penalty for the first subsequence is `3` (since there are 3 indices where `b_i < b_{i+1}`), and the penalty for the second subsequence is `0`.

However, the program will output `4` because it incorrectly counts the penalty. The logic in the program does not correctly handle the case where the array is strictly increasing, leading to an incorrect penalty count.

### Detailed Analysis:
- The program initializes `a` and `b` to `float('inf')` and then iterates through the array.
- It updates `a` and `b` based on the current element `l[x]`.
- The condition `if a > b: (a, b) = (b, a)` is intended to keep `a` and `b` in a specific order, but it does not help in correctly calculating the penalty.
- The program increments `c` whenever `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, which does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences.

The correct approach should involve a more sophisticated method to split the array and calculate the penalty, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to ensure the minimum penalty is achieved. The provided program does not meet this requirement and thus is incorrect.
