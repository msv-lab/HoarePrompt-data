Postcondition: ***`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 1, and `c` is 0 or 1. If `a` > `b`, `a` and `b` are swapped. After the swap, if `l[0]` is less than or equal to the original `a`, then `a` is `float('inf')` and `b` is `l[0]`. If `l[0]` is greater than the original `a` but less than or equal to the original `b`, then `a` is `l[0]` and `b` is `float('inf')`. If `l[0]` is greater than both the original `a` and `b`, then `a` is `float('inf')` and `b` is `l[0]`. If `a` â‰¤ `b`, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is set to `l[1]`. If `l[x]` is greater than `a` but less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is set to 1 or 2, and `a` is set to `l[1]`.***
