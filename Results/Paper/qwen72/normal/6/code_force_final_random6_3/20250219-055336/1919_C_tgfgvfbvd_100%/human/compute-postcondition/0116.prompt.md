Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is `n-1`, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(n):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    if l[x] <= a:
        a = l[x]
    elif l[x] <= b:
        b = l[x]
    else:
        a = l[x]
        c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `x` is 0. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[0]`. If `a` > `b` initially, `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the previous value of `a`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `l[0]` is greater than `a`, then if `l[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, `b` is updated to `l[0]`. If `a` > `b` initially, `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to `l[0]`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `b` is updated to `l[0]`. If `l[0]` is greater than `b`, then if `a` > `b` initially, `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the previous value of `a`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `a` is updated to `l[0]`. Additionally, `c` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `x` is 1, and `c` is increased by 1. If `l[1]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[1]`. If `l[1]` is greater than `a` but less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to `l[1]`. If `l[1]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[1]`. If `a` > `b` initially, `a` and `b` swap values. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `x` is 2, and `c` is increased by 1. If `l[2]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[2]`. If `a` > `b` initially, `a` and `b` swap values; otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `l[2]` is greater than `a`, then `b` is equal to `l[2]` if `l[2]` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise `a` is equal to `l[2]`. If `a` > `b` initially, `a` and `b` swap values; otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
