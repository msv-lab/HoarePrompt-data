Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 2, `a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the previous value of `a`, `c` is 0 or 1 depending on the previous conditions.**

Explanation:
- The values of `int(input())`, `_`, `n`, `l`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, so `a` now holds the previous value of `b`, and `b` now holds the previous value of `a`.
- The value of `c` remains as it was determined by the previous conditions (either 0 or 1).
