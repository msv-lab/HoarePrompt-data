Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 2, `a` is updated to `l[2]`, `b` remains infinity, and `c` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is updated to `l[2]`, which is the third element of the list `l`.
- The value of `b` remains infinity.
- The value of `c` is set to 0 because the condition for updating `c` to 1 (i.e., `l[x]` being greater than `b`) is not met.
- The values of `int(input())`, `_`, `n`, `l`, and `x` remain unchanged.
