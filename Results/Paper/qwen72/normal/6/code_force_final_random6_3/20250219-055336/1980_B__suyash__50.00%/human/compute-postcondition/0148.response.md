Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `l` must have at least one element.
   - `fav` is equal to `l[0]`.
   - `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[0]]`.
   - The current value of `k` is less than 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('MAYBE')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'MAYBE'`.
   - The values of `i`, `l`, `fav`, and `k` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'MAYBE'`.

Output: **MAYBE**
