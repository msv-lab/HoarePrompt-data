Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` and converting each element to an integer, `o` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input and sorted in descending order, `n` is equal to the first integer in the list `b`, `f` is equal to the second integer in the list `b`, `k` is equal to the third integer in the list `b` minus the count of the first unique string in the list `l` as found in the dictionary `dic` if `fav` is not equal to the first element of `l`, otherwise `k` is equal to the third integer in the list `b` minus the count of the string at index `i` in the list `l` in the dictionary `dic` minus the count of the string at index `i` in the list `l` in the dictionary `dic`. If `k` is less than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is greater than or equal to 0, the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
