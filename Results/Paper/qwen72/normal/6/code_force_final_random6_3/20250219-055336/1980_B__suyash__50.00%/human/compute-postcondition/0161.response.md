The `print('MAYBE')` statement will print the string `'MAYBE'`.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `i` is 1.
- `l` has at least two elements.
- `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[1]]`.

However, the `print` statement itself does not use any of these variables or objects. It simply prints a constant string.

Output: **MAYBE**
