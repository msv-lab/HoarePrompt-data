The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `l` has at least two elements.
   - `k` is decreased by `dic[l[2]]`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

3. **Variables and Objects**:
   - The variables `i`, `l`, and `k` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
   - The dictionary `dic` is also mentioned, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - Since the `print` statement only contains a string literal `'YES'`, the output will be exactly that string.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
