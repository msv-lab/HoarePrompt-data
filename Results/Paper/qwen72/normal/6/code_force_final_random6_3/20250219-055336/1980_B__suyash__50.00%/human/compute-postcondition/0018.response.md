Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` and converting each element to an integer, `o` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input and sorted in descending order, `n` is equal to the first integer in the list `b`, `f` is equal to the second integer in the list `b`, `k` is equal to the third integer in the list `b`, `fav` is the string at the index `f - 1` in the list `o` before it was sorted, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a string from `o` and each value is the count of how many times that string appears in `o`. If the index of `fav` in the sorted list `o` is greater than `k - 1`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program proceeds as usual.***
