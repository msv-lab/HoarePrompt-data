Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `l`, `i` is the length of the list `l`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the new `a` and converting each element to an integer, `n` is equal to the first integer in the new list `b`, `f` is equal to the second integer in the new list `b`, `k` is equal to the third integer in the new list `b`, `fav` is the string at the index `f - 1` in the list `o` after it has been sorted in descending order, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a string from `o` and each value is the count of how many times that string appears in `o`, `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order, and `o` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, now sorted in descending order. If the index of `fav` in `o` is greater than `k - 1`, then the program retains all the above conditions. Otherwise, the program retains all the above conditions.*** 

Note: Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition with the additional condition that the index of `fav` in `o` is greater than `k - 1` if the if condition is true. If the if condition is false, the program simply retains the precondition.
