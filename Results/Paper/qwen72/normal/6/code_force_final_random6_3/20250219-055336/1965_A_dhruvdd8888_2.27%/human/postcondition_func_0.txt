The function reads an integer `N` and a list of integers from the user, converts the list to a set of unique integers, sorts them, and then determines the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob') based on the following logic: If the list has only one unique integer, 'Alice' wins. If the list has two unique integers, 'Bob' wins. If the list has more than two unique integers, the function checks for consecutive pairs of integers with a difference of 1. If the count of such consecutive pairs is odd, 'Bob' wins; otherwise, 'Alice' wins. The function prints the winner and returns `None`.
