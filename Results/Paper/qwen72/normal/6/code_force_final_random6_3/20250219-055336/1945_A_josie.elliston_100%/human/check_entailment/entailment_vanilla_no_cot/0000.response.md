Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the participants based on their preferences. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the universals can form a complete tent (i.e., `extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3`).
   - If it can, it returns the total number of tents needed for extroverts and universals using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.
   - If it cannot, it returns `None` indicating that it's impossible to form the required tents.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function combines the results from `func_1` with the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when there are no participants or when it's impossible to form the required tents for extroverts and universals. The example cases provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program. Therefore, the program is correct.
