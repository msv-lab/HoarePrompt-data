You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
from math import ceil
from typing import Optional
#Function 1:
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
            return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

#Function 2:
def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts three non-negative integers `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`. It returns -1 if `func_1(extroverts, universals)` returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - **Introverts**: Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - **Extroverts**: Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - **Universals**: Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two other people.
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, or output -1 if it is impossible.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - **Condition 1**: If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it means there are some extroverts that cannot form complete groups of 3. In this case, we need to check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots.
   - **Condition 2**: If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts. This makes it impossible to accommodate all extroverts, so the function returns `None`.
   - **Return Value**: If the above conditions are not met, the function returns the ceiling of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`, which is the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all extroverts and universals.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**:
   - This function combines the results from `func_1` and the number of introverts.
   - **Step 1**: Call `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.
   - **Step 2**: If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate all extroverts and universals, so the function returns `-1`.
   - **Step 3**: If `func_1` returns a valid number of tents, add the number of introverts to this value and return the result. This is because each introvert needs a separate tent.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3`
     - Introverts: 1 tent
     - Extroverts: 2 extroverts + 1 universal = 1 tent
     - Remaining universals: 2 universals = 1 tent
     - Total tents: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - **Case 2**: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 1`
     - Introverts: 1 tent
     - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 4/3 = 1.33 tents, but since we can't have a fraction of a tent, we need 2 tents. However, we only have 1 universal, which is not enough to fill the remaining spots in the second tent.
     - Total tents: -1 (impossible)
   - **Case 3**: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 2`
     - Introverts: 1 tent
     - Extroverts: 4 extroverts + 2 universals = 2 tents
     - Total tents: 1 + 2 = 3
   - **Case 4**: `a = 1, b = 1, c = 1`
     - Introverts: 1 tent
     - Extroverts: 1 extrovert needs 1/3 = 0.33 tents, but we need 1 tent. We have 1 universal, which is not enough to form a complete tent.
     - Total tents: -1 (impossible)
   - **Case 5**: `a = 1, b = 3, c = 2`
     - Introverts: 1 tent
     - Extroverts: 3 extroverts + 2 universals = 1 tent
     - Total tents: 1 + 1 = 3
   - **Case 6**: `a = 19, b = 7, c = 18`
     - Introverts: 19 tents
     - Extroverts: 7 extroverts + 18 universals = 7 + 18 = 25 people, which can be accommodated in 25/3 = 8.33 tents, rounded up to 9 tents.
     - Total tents: 19 + 9 = 28
   - **Case 7**: `a = 0, b = 0, c = 0`
     - No participants, so 0 tents.
   - **Case 8**: `a = 7, b = 0, c = 0`
     - Introverts: 7 tents
     - No extroverts or universals, so 7 tents.
   - **Case 9**: `a = 0, b = 24, c = 0`
     - Extroverts: 24 extroverts = 24/3 = 8 tents
     - No introverts or universals, so 8 tents.
   - **Case 10**: `a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000, c = 1000000000`
     - Introverts: 1000000000 tents
     - Extroverts: 1000000000 extroverts + 1000000000 universals = 2000000000 people, which can be accommodated in 2000000000/3 = 666666666.67 tents, rounded up to 666666667 tents.
     - Total tents: 1000000000 + 666666667 = 1666666667

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly handles the logic for determining the number of tents needed for introverts, extroverts, and universals.
   - It correctly returns `-1` when it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.
   - The program also handles edge cases and large inputs correctly.
