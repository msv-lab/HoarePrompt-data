Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 3]` and must be greater than 0, `t` remains `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + n + 3 + n`, `data` remains a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is a list containing two string representations of `ans`, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `v[x]` is now `n`, `cnt` is the value of `v[i]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 2 + n - 1]`, `_` is `n - 1`, `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to its current value.
- `cnt` is the value of `v[i]`, which is `v[1]`.
- `v[1]` is 0 (since `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`).
- Therefore, `ans` is updated by adding `0 * 0 * (0 - 1) // 2` to its current value, which is 0.
- The value of `ans` remains unchanged after this operation.
- All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
