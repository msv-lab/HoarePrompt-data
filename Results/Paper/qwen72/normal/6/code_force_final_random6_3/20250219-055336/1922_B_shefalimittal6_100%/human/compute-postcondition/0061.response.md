Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + 6`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is a list containing a single string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `v[x]` is now 2, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 2]` and must be greater than 0, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `n`, `x` is the integer value of `data[n + 5]`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`.**

Explanation:
- `idx` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `n + 6`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
