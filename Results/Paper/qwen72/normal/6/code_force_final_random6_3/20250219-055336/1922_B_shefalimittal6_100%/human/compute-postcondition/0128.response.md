Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 3]` and must be greater than 0, `t` remains `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + n + 3 + n`, `data` remains a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is a list containing three string representations of `ans`, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `v[x]` is now `n`, `cnt` is the sum of all values in `v`, `x` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 2 + n - 1]`, `_` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is the sum of all combinations of 2 and 3 from the values in `v` that are greater than or equal to 2 and 3, respectively.**
