Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 3]` and must be greater than 0, `t` remains `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + n + 3 + n`, `data` remains a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is a list containing two string representations of `ans`, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `v[x]` is now `n`, `cnt` is the value of `v[i]` plus 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 2 + n - 1]`, `_` is `n - 1`, `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to it.
- `cnt` is `v[i] + 1`.
- `v[i]` is a specific value from the list `v`, which is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` and `v[x]` is `n`.
- The other variables (`i`, `n`, `t`, `idx`, `data`, `results`, `v`, `x`, `_`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
