Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 4, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `v[x]` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer equal to `int(data[3])`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `v[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `v` by 1. Initially, `v[x]` was 1, so after the increment, `v[x]` is now 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
