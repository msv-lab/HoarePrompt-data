Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a list of lists `sticks` (where each inner list contains integers representing the exponents of the lengths of the sticks, and the sum of the lengths of all inner lists does not exceed 3 · 10^5). The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and indicates whether it is possible to form a square using the sticks in that test case.**
