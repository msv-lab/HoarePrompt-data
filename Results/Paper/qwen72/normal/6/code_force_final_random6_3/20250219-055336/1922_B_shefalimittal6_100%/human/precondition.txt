The function `main` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) where each `a_i` represents the exponent of the length of the i-th stick, which is 2^{a_i}. The input is provided in a specific format where the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, the first line contains `n`, followed by the second line containing the list of exponents. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
