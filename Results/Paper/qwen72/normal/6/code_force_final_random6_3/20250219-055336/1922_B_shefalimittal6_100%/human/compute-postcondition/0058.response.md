Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + 5`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is a list containing a single string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `v[x]` is now 2, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 2]` and must be greater than 0, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `n`, `x` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`, `_` is incremented by 1**

Explanation:
- `v[x]` was initially 1, and the code `v[x] += 1` increments it by 1, making it 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
