### Reasoning:

Let's evaluate the provided program step by step using the annotations and the problem description.

#### Function 1: `func_1(lst)`
- **Purpose**: This function is intended to find the subarray `[a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r]` that, when replaced with its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
- **Logic**:
  - It initializes `r` and `l` to 0.
  - It calculates the initial sum of the array `over_sum`.
  - It iterates over all possible subarrays `[a_i, a_{i+1}, ..., a_j]` and calculates the sum of the array if the subarray is replaced with the length of the subarray squared, `(j - i + 1) ** 2`.
  - If this new sum `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, it updates `r` and `l` to the current indices `i` and `j` and updates `over_sum` to `sm`.
- **Annotation**:
  - The function returns the indices `r` and `l` where the maximum sum `sm` was found.
  - The annotation suggests that `r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray that, when replaced with its MEX, maximizes the sum. However, the function does not compute the MEX; it simply uses the length of the subarray squared, which is not the correct MEX value.

#### Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops)`
- **Purpose**: This function is intended to generate a sequence of operations to replace the subarray `[a_r, a_{r+1}, ..., a_l]` with its MEX.
- **Logic**:
  - If `r` equals `l`, it appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`.
  - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `l - 1` and appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` twice.
- **Annotation**:
  - The function appends operations to `ops` but does not actually compute the MEX or replace the subarray elements with the MEX.

#### Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst, ops)`
- **Purpose**: This function is intended to apply the operation to the subarray `[a_r, a_{r+1}, ..., a_l]` and update the array and operations list.
- **Logic**:
  - It appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`.
  - If the minimum value in the subarray `[a_r, a_{r+1}, ..., a_l]` is 0, it appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` again.
  - It appends `[r + 1, r + 1]` to `ops`.
  - It recursively calls `func_2` with `r` and `l`.
  - It appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` again.
  - It updates the subarray `[a_r, a_{r+1}, ..., a_l]` with the length of the subarray `n`.
- **Annotation**:
  - The function updates the subarray with the length of the subarray, which is not the correct MEX value.
  - The function appends operations to `ops` but does not correctly handle the MEX computation or the replacement logic.

#### Main Program
- **Logic**:
  - It reads the input and initializes the list `lst` and the operations list `ops`.
  - It calls `func_1` to find the subarray that maximizes the sum.
  - It enters a loop to repeatedly call `func_3` and `func_1` until `r` equals `l`.
  - It then enters a loop to replace all 0s in the array with 1s and appends the corresponding operations to `ops`.
  - Finally, it prints the sum of the array and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.
- **Annotation**:
  - The main program correctly reads the input and initializes the lists.
  - It calls `func_1` and `func_3` to update the array and operations list.
  - The final loop to replace 0s with 1s is a valid step to ensure the maximum sum, but it does not address the core issue of computing the MEX and applying the operations correctly.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment

The original assessment is correct in stating that the program does not correctly implement the required operations to maximize the sum of the array elements. The key issues are:

1. **MEX Calculation**: The program does not compute the MEX of the subarray. Instead, it uses the length of the subarray squared, which is incorrect.
2. **Subarray Replacement**: The program does not replace the subarray elements with the MEX. Instead, it replaces them with the length of the subarray, which is not the correct value.
3. **Operation Sequence**: The operations generated by the program do not correctly reflect the MEX-based replacements required by the problem.

### Final Evaluation

Given the issues identified above, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
