### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing operations that set a subarray to its MEX.
   - The MEX of a subarray is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The number of operations should not exceed 5 * 10^5.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**:
   - This function aims to find the optimal subarray `[l, r]` that, when replaced by its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
   - The function iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the subarray `[i, j]` is replaced by its MEX.
   - However, the MEX is approximated by `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is incorrect. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not the square of the subarray length.
   - The function returns the indices of the optimal subarray and the maximum possible sum.
   - **Inaccuracy**: The MEX calculation is incorrect, leading to incorrect potential sums and subarray indices.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**:
   - This function is intended to recursively add operations to the list `ops` to set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX of the subarray.
   - The function does not correctly compute the MEX and does not handle the subarray replacement correctly.
   - It appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` but does not actually set the subarray to the MEX.
   - **Inaccuracy**: The function does not compute the MEX and does not perform the required subarray replacement.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**:
   - This function is supposed to set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX of the subarray and update the operations list `ops`.
   - It appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`.
   - It checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0 and appends the operation again if true.
   - It then appends the operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` and recursively calls `func_2`.
   - Finally, it sets the subarray `[r, l]` to the length of the subarray.
   - **Inaccuracy**: The function does not correctly compute the MEX. It sets the subarray to the length of the subarray, which is not the MEX. The recursive calls to `func_2` are also incorrect and do not align with the problem requirements.

5. **Overall Program**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the MEX of a subarray.
   - The recursive functions `func_2` and `func_3` do not correctly handle the subarray replacement and the operations.
   - The program does not ensure that the sum is maximized or that the operations are valid according to the problem constraints.
   - **Inaccuracy**: The core logic for computing the MEX and performing the operations is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly compute the MEX of a subarray, and the recursive functions do not handle the subarray replacement and operations correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
