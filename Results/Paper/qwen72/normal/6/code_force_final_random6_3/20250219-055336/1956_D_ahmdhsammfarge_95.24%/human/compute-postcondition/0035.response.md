Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 <= n <= 18` and `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[1]`, `lst[2]`, and `lst[3]` plus 25, `r` is 1, `l` is 3, and `over_sum` is equal to `sm`.**

Explanation:
- The code `over_sum = sm` updates the value of `over_sum` to be equal to `sm`.
- According to the initial state, if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is set to 1, `l` is set to 3, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`. Since the code snippet directly sets `over_sum` to `sm`, this condition is met, and the values of `r` and `l` are updated accordingly.
- The values of `lst`, `i`, `j`, and `sm` remain unchanged.
- The updated values are reflected in the output state.
