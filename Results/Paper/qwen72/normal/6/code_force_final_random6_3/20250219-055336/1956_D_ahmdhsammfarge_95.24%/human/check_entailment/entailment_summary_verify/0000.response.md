### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function 1: `func_1(lst)`
- **Purpose**: This function is intended to find the subarray that, when replaced with its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
- **Behavior**: It iterates over all possible subarrays, computes the sum of the array if the subarray is replaced with its length squared, and keeps track of the subarray that results in the maximum sum.
- **Issues**:
  - The function does not compute the MEX of the subarray; it simply uses the length of the subarray squared.
  - The function returns the indices of the subarray that maximizes the sum, but it does not actually perform the operation or update the array.
  - The function does not ensure that the MEX is the correct value to replace the subarray with.

#### Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`
- **Purpose**: This function is intended to recursively add operations to the `ops` list.
- **Behavior**: It adds the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list and recursively calls itself with `l - 1` until `r == l`.
- **Issues**:
  - The function does not compute the MEX of the subarray.
  - The function does not update the array elements.
  - The function does not ensure that the operations are valid or optimal.

#### Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`
- **Purpose**: This function is intended to apply the operation to the subarray `lst[r:l + 1]` and update the `ops` list.
- **Behavior**: It appends several operations to the `ops` list and sets the elements in the subarray to the length of the subarray.
- **Issues**:
  - The function does not compute the MEX of the subarray.
  - The function appends operations in a way that does not necessarily maximize the sum.
  - The function updates the subarray with the length of the subarray, which is not the correct MEX value.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program does not correctly implement the required operations to maximize the sum of the array elements. This is accurate because:

1. **MEX Calculation**: None of the functions correctly compute the MEX of a subarray. The MEX is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray, but the functions use the length of the subarray squared or other incorrect values.
2. **Operation Application**: The functions do not correctly apply the operations to replace the elements in the subarray with the MEX. Instead, they use incorrect values and append operations in a non-optimal way.
3. **Maximizing the Sum**: The functions do not ensure that the sum of the array is maximized by repeatedly applying the correct operations. The logic for identifying and applying the optimal subarray operations is missing.

### Specific Example:
For the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The expected output is:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
However, the actual output of the provided program will be incorrect because:
- `func_1` will not correctly identify the subarray that maximizes the sum.
- `func_2` and `func_3` will not correctly apply the operations to replace the subarray with the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the required operations to maximize the sum of the array elements as described in the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
