Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 <= n <= 18`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` plus `1`, `r` is 1, `l` is 2, and `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations of the loop, and the current value of `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `r, l = [i, j]` assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `r` and `l` respectively. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, `r` becomes 1 and `l` becomes 2. The other variables (`lst`, `sm`, and `over_sum`) remain unchanged.
