Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 < n <= 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` from index 0 to 1 and from index 4 to `n-1` plus 4, `r` is 2, `l` is 3, `over_sum` is now equal to `sm`.** 

The value of `over_sum` has been updated to be equal to the current value of `sm`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
