The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of `lst`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 <= n <= 18`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `lst` must still have a length greater than `j`.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 <= n <= 18`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` plus 1, `r` is 0, and `l` is the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `r` is 1, `l` is 2, and `over_sum` is updated to be equal to `sm`. Otherwise, `r` remains 0 and `over_sum` remains unchanged.**
