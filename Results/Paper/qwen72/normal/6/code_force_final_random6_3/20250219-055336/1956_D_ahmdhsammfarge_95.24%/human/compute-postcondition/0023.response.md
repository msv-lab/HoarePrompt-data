Postcondition: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 <= n <= 18`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` plus `1`, `r` is 0, and `l` is the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found. `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations of the loop, and the current value of `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.**
