You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers of length n, where 1 <= n <= 18.
def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):

    #State: `lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `1 <= n <= 18`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `n`, `r` is the value of `i` where the maximum `sm` was found, `l` is the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found, and `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations of the loop.
    return r, l
    #The program returns the value of `i` where the maximum `sm` was found (`r`), and the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found (`l`). `r` is `n-1` and `l` is `n`, where `n` is the length of the list `lst`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers with a length between 1 and 18. It calculates the maximum possible sum of the elements outside a subarray of `lst` plus the square of the length of that subarray. The function returns two integers, `r` and `l`, which represent the starting and ending indices of the subarray that results in this maximum sum. After the function concludes, `lst` remains unchanged, and `r` and `l` are the indices that define the subarray contributing to the maximum sum.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: r and l are non-negative integers such that r <= l, and ops is a list that can store lists of integers.
def func_2(r, l, ops):
    if (r == l) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
        #The program does not return any value.
    #State: r and l are non-negative integers such that r < l, and ops is a list that can store lists of integers.
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `r` and `l` where `r` is less than or equal to `l`, and a list `ops` that can store lists of integers. It modifies the `ops` list by appending pairs of integers `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times, depending on the values of `r` and `l`. The function does not return any value, but the `ops` list will contain the appended pairs after the function concludes. The number of appended pairs is determined by the difference between `l` and `r`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers, r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), and ops is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers.
def func_3(r, l, lst, ops):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if (min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    #State: `lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers, and `ops` now includes an additional list `[r + 1, l + 1]`. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
    #The program returns the list `lst` where the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` contains `n` elements, each equal to `n`. The values of `r`, `l`, and `ops` remain unchanged. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is no longer 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It modifies the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` such that each element in this sublist is set to the length of the sublist (`n`). The function also appends several lists to `ops`, including `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times and `[r + 1, r + 1]` once. The function returns the modified list `lst`, ensuring that the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is no longer 0. The values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required operations to maximize the sum of the array elements as described in the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not follow the correct logic for computing the MEX of a subarray and applying the operations to maximize the sum.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
4
1 100 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```

**Actual Output:**
The actual output of the provided program will not match the expected output because the functions do not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray and apply the operations as required.

The program should:
1. Identify the subarray that, when replaced with its MEX, maximizes the sum.
2. Apply the operation to replace the elements in the subarray with the MEX.
3. Repeat the process until no further improvement can be made, ensuring the total number of operations does not exceed 5 * 10^5.

The provided functions do not correctly handle these steps, leading to incorrect results.
