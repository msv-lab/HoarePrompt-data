Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n, where 1 <= n <= 18, `i` is 0, `j` is n-1, `sm` is equal to the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[0]` and `lst[n-1]` plus (n-1)^2, `r` is 0, and `l` is the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found. `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations of the loop.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all possible values of `j` from `i + 1` to `len(lst) - 1`.
- For each iteration, `sm` is calculated as the sum of all elements in `lst` except those from `lst[0]` to `lst[i]` and from `lst[j + 1]` to the end of the list, plus the square of the length of the segment from `lst[i]` to `lst[j]`.
- If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, `over_sum` is updated to `sm`, and `r` and `l` are set to `i` and `j`, respectively.
- After all iterations, `j` will have reached `n-1`, and `over_sum` will hold the maximum value of `sm` found, with `r` and `l` indicating the indices that produced this maximum value.
