The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers with a length between 1 and 18. It calculates the maximum possible sum of the elements outside a subarray of `lst` plus the square of the length of that subarray. The function returns two integers, `r` and `l`, which represent the starting and ending indices of the subarray that results in this maximum sum. After the function concludes, `lst` remains unchanged, and `r` and `l` are the indices that define the subarray contributing to the maximum sum.
