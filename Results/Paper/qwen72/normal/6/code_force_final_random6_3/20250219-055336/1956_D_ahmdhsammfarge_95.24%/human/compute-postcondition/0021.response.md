To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `lst`. The loop will execute if `j` is within the range defined by `i + 1` to `len(lst) - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `lst` is a list of integers of length `n`, where `1 <= n <= 18`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is `n-1`.

For the loop to execute, `j` must be adjusted to be within the range `i + 1` to `len(lst) - 1`. Since `i` is 1, the loop will start with `j = 2` and will iterate as long as `j < len(lst)`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `j` is 2 (the starting value for the loop).
- `lst` must have a length greater than 2 to ensure the loop has at least one iteration.

The other variables (`sm`, `r`, `l`, and `over_sum`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 <= n <= 18`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `sm` is equal to the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[0]` and `lst[n-1]` plus `(n-1)^2`, `r` is 0, and `l` is the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found. `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations of the loop.**
