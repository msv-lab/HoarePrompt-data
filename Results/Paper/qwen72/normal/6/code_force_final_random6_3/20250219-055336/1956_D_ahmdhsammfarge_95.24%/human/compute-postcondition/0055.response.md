Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 < n <= 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is `n-1`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` from index 0 to 1 and from index `n-1` to `n-1` plus `(n-3)^2`, `r` is the value of `i` where the maximum `sm` was found, `l` is the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found, and `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations of the loop.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The list `lst` remains unchanged.
- The variable `i` is still 2.
- The variable `j` has reached the value `n-1`, which is the last index of the list minus one.
- The variable `sm` is the sum of the elements from index 0 to 1 and from index `n-1` to `n-1` (which is just `lst[n-1]`), plus the square of the difference between `j` and `i` plus one, which is `(n-3)^2`.
- The variable `r` is the value of `i` where the maximum `sm` was found.
- The variable `l` is the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found.
- The variable `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations of the loop.
