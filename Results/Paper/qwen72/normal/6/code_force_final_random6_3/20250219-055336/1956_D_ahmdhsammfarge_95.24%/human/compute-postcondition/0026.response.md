Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 <= n <= 18`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` plus 1, `r` is 0, and `l` is the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `r` is 1, `l` is 2, and `over_sum` is updated to be equal to `sm`. Otherwise, `r` remains 0 and `over_sum` remains unchanged.***
