Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 <= n <= 18`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[0]`, `lst[1]`, `lst[2]`, and `lst[3]` plus 4. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `r` is 1, `l` is 3, and `over_sum` is updated to be equal to `sm`. Otherwise, `r` remains 0 and `over_sum` remains unchanged.***
