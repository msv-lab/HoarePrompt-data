Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 <= n <= 18` and `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[1]` and `lst[2]` and `lst[3]` plus 25. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `r` is 1, `l` is 3, and `over_sum` is updated to be equal to `sm`. Otherwise, `r` remains 0 and `over_sum` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `sm` is updated to the sum of all elements in `lst` from the start up to `lst[0]` (which is `sum(lst[:i])`), plus the sum of all elements in `lst` from `lst[5]` to the end (which is `sum(lst[j + 1:])`), plus the square of the difference `(j - i + 1)`, which is 25.
- The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
- The value of `over_sum` and `r` are only updated if the new `sm` is greater than `over_sum`. If not, they remain as they were in the initial state.
