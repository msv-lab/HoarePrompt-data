Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 < n <= 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` from index 0 to 1 and from index 4 to `n-1` plus 4, `r` is 1, `l` is the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found, and `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations of the loop. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `r` is 2, `l` is 3, and `over_sum` is updated to the value of `sm`. Otherwise, `r` remains 1 and `over_sum` remains unchanged.***
