The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= r <= l < len(lst)`. `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers. After executing the function body, the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is modified such that each element in this sublist is set to the length of the sublist (`n`), where `n` is the number of elements in `lst[r:l + 1]`. The function returns the modified list `lst`, ensuring that the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is no longer 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It modifies the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` such that each element in this sublist is set to the length of the sublist (`n`).
