Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `test` is greater than 1, and `t` is 2. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the program executes the if part. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the program executes the else part. The specific actions within the if and else parts are not detailed, but the sum of `a` and `b` retains its even or odd nature based on the user input.***
