Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in the condition used to determine the winner. Specifically, the condition `if a + b & 1 == 0:` is incorrect. The bitwise AND operator `&` has higher precedence than the addition operator `+`, so the expression `a + b & 1` is not equivalent to `(a + b) & 1`. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1
```
The correct output should be "Bob" because both Alice and Bob have 1 coin, and after Alice's move, Bob will win. However, the program will incorrectly compute `1 + 1 & 1` as `1 & 1` which is `1`, and thus it will print "Alice" instead of "Bob".

To fix this, the condition should be written as:
```python
if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
```
This correctly checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, which is the correct logic for determining the winner.
