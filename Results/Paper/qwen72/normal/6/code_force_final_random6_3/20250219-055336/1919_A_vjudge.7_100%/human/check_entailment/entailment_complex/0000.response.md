### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`test`) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

2. **Game Logic**:
   - The game involves a series of moves where each player can either swap wallets or keep their own, and then remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (even or odd) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win because the game will end in a state where both wallets are empty, and it will be Alice's turn to move, making her unable to make a valid move.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win because the game will end in a state where one wallet is empty and the other has one coin, and it will be Bob's turn to move, making him unable to make a valid move.

3. **Parity Check**:
   - The program uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to check the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.
   - The expression `a + b & 1` is used to determine if the sum is odd or even. However, this should be written as `(a + b) & 1` to ensure the addition is performed before the bitwise AND operation.
   - If `(a + b) & 1` is 0, the sum is even, and the program prints 'Bob'.
   - If `(a + b) & 1` is 1, the sum is odd, and the program prints 'Alice'.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even and 'Alice' if the sum is odd for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation. The only minor issue is the placement of parentheses in the parity check, but this does not affect the correctness of the program because Python's operator precedence ensures that addition is performed before the bitwise AND operation.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
