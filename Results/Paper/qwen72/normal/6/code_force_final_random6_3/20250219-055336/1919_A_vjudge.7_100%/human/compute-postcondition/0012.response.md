Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `test` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, and the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd based on the user input. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the program executes the if part. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the program executes the else part.***
