Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `q` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= q <= 1000. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). It then checks the relationship between these three integers and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state is that `q` test cases have been processed, with the appropriate output printed for each case. **
