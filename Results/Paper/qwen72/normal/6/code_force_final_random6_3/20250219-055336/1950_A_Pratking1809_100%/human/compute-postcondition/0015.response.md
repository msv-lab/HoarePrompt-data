The given `print` statement is:
```
print('PEAK')
```

Based on the initial state:
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- If `a < b < c`, then the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy `a < b < c`.
- If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b` and `b > c` holds.
- Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` holds.

The `print` statement itself does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
