Reasoning:  
The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `q`, and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. The program then checks the conditions for a "stair" (`a < b < c`) and a "peak" (`a < b > c`). If either condition is met, it prints the corresponding output; otherwise, it prints "NONE". The logic and the conditions used in the program match the problem description exactly. There are no logical errors or issues with the input handling or the conditions.

Correctness: **True**
