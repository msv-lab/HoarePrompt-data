Postcondition: ***`ii` is 2, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 1 and updated to the values provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `t` is a user input string, `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`, `i` is `n - 2`, and `y` is a list of `n` integers where each element is 0 except the last element which is `k`. If the last character of `t` is 'L', `k` is `a[l - 1] % m` and if the character at index `i` in `t` is 'R', `q1` is `l - 2` and `q2` is `l + 1`, and the new value of `k` is `k * a[q2] % m`. If the character at index `i` in `t` is not 'R', `q1` is `l - 3` and `q2` is `l`, and the new value of `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`. If the last character of `t` is not 'L', `k` is `a[l] % m` and if the character at index `i` in `t` is 'R', `q1` is `l - 1` and `q2` is `l + 2`, and the new value of `k` is `k * a[q2] % m`. If the character at index `i` in `t` is not 'R', `q1` is `l - 2` and `q2` is `l + 1`, and the new value of `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`.***
