Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `t` is a user input string, `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`, the current value of `i` is such that the character at `t[i]` is 'R', if the last character of `t` is 'L', `k` is `a[l - 1] % m * a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l + 1`; otherwise, `k` is `a[l] % m * a[l + 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, and `q2` is `l + 2`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros, with the last element set to the updated `k`.**
