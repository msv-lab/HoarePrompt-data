Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `t` is a user input string, `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input. If the last character of `t` is 'L', `k` is set to `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is set to `l - 2`, and `q2` is set to `l`. Otherwise, `k` is set to `a[l] % m`, `q1` is set to `l - 1`, and `q2` is set to `l + 1`.**
