### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the command string `t`.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function initializes `l` as the count of 'L' characters in the command string `t`.
   - It initializes `k` to the modulo result of the appropriate element in `a` based on the last command in `t`.
   - It sets `q1` and `q2` to the appropriate indices for the initial state of the array `a`.

3. **Output List Initialization:**
   - The function initializes a list `y` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.

4. **Final Element Calculation:**
   - The function correctly sets the last element of `y` to `k`, which is the result of the modulo operation for the last command.

5. **Loop for Remaining Commands:**
   - The function iterates from `n-2` to `0` (i.e., from the second-to-last command to the first command).
   - For each command, it updates `k` by multiplying it with the appropriate element in `a` and taking the modulo `m`.
   - It correctly updates `q1` and `q2` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
   - It sets the corresponding element in `y` to the updated value of `k`.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the list `y` for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Initial Value for `k`:**
  - The initial value of `k` is set based on the last command in `t`, but this is incorrect. The initial value of `k` should be the product of all elements in `a` modulo `m`.
  - The correct initial value of `k` should be calculated as `k = 1` and then `k = (k * a[i]) % m` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

- **Incorrect Update of `q1` and `q2`:**
  - The initial values of `q1` and `q2` are set based on the last command, which is incorrect. They should be set to the appropriate indices for the initial state of the array.
  - The correct initial values should be `q1 = 0` and `q2 = n - 1`.

- **Incorrect Multiplication in the Loop:**
  - The loop should multiply `k` with the appropriate element in `a` and then take the modulo `m`.
  - The current implementation is incorrect because it uses `q1` and `q2` incorrectly.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for ii in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        t = input()
        
        # Calculate the initial product modulo m
        k = 1
        for num in a:
            k = (k * num) % m
        
        y = [0] * n
        
        q1 = 0
        q2 = n - 1
        
        for i in range(n):
            y[i] = k
            if t[i] == 'L':
                k = (k * pow(a[q1], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove the leftmost element
                q1 += 1
            else:
                k = (k * pow(a[q2], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove the rightmost element
                q2 -= 1
        
        print(*y)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initial Product Calculation:**
  - The initial value of `k` is calculated as the product of all elements in `a` modulo `m`.

- **Loop for Each Command:**
  - For each command, the current value of `k` is stored in `y`.
  - If the command is 'L', the leftmost element is removed by multiplying `k` with the modular inverse of `a[q1]` and then incrementing `q1`.
  - If the command is 'R', the rightmost element is removed by multiplying `k` with the modular inverse of `a[q2]` and then decrementing `q2`.

- **Modular Inverse:**
  - The modular inverse of `a[q1]` or `a[q2]` is calculated using `pow(a[q1], m-2, m)` or `pow(a[q2], m-2, m)`, which works because `m` is a positive integer and the elements of `a` are non-zero.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues identified. The corrected program should work as expected.
