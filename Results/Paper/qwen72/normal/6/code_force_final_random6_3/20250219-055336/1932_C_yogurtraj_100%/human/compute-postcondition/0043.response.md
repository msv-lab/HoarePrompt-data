To determine what will be printed by the `print(*y)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ii` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
   - `m` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by user input.
   - `t` is a user input string.
   - `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`.
   - `y` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the updated value of `k` at each iteration, starting from the last element and moving backwards.
   - `k` is the final value of `k` after all iterations.
   - `q1` and `q2` are updated based on the conditions described in the loop, but their final values depend on the specific characters in `t` and the length of `t`.

2. **Understanding the List `y`:**
   - The list `y` is populated with the values of `k` at each iteration, starting from the last element and moving backwards.
   - The exact values of `k` at each iteration depend on the conditions and updates described in the loop, which are not provided in the initial state.

3. **Output of `print(*y)`:**
   - The `print(*y)` statement will print the elements of the list `y` separated by spaces.
   - Since the exact values of `k` at each iteration are not provided, we can only describe the values of `y` in terms of the conditions and updates that affect `k`.

Given the initial state and the lack of specific conditions and updates for `k`, the output will be a list of `n` integers, where each integer is the value of `k` at a specific iteration, starting from the last element and moving backwards.

Output: **[k_n, k_(n-1), ..., k_1] (where k_i is the value of k at the i-th iteration, starting from the last element and moving backwards)**
