Postcondition: ***`ii` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `t` is a user input string, `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element set to the updated value of `k`, `i` is -1. If `t[i]` is 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m` and `q2` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is decreased by 1.***
