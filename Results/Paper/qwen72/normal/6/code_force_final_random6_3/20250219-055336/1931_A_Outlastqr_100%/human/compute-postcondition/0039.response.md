Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed by the `print(word)` statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer within the range 3 to 78.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `word` is determined based on the value of `n` as follows:
     - If `n` > 52, `word` is the string corresponding to the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string, followed by 'zz'.
     - If `n` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `word` is a string containing 'a' followed by the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` list, followed by 'z'.
     - If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'.
     - If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), `word` is 'aa' + `alphabet[n - 3]`.

2. **Determine the value of `word` based on the value of `n`:**
   - **Case 1: `n` > 52**
     - `word` will be the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string, followed by 'zz'.
     - For example, if `n = 55`, then `word` will be `alphabet[55 - 53] + 'zz'` which is `alphabet[2] + 'zz'` (since `alphabet[2]` is 'c'), so `word` will be 'czz'.
   - **Case 2: 28 ≤ `n` ≤ 52**
     - `word` will be 'a' followed by the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` list, followed by 'z'.
     - For example, if `n = 30`, then `word` will be `'a' + alphabet[30 - 28] + 'z'` which is `'a' + alphabet[2] + 'z'` (since `alphabet[2]` is 'c'), so `word` will be 'acz'.
   - **Case 3: `n` = 27**
     - `word` will be 'aay'.
   - **Case 4: 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 26**
     - `word` will be 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3` in the `alphabet` list.
     - For example, if `n = 5`, then `word` will be `'aa' + alphabet[5 - 3]` which is `'aa' + alphabet[2]` (since `alphabet[2]` is 'c'), so `word` will be 'aac'.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(word)` statement will print the value of `word` based on the conditions described above.

Output: **word (where word is determined as follows: if `n` > 52, `word` is the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string followed by 'zz'; if 28 ≤ `n` ≤ 52, `word` is 'a' followed by the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` list followed by 'z'; if `n` = 27, `word` is 'aay'; if 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 26, `word` is 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3` in the `alphabet` list)**
