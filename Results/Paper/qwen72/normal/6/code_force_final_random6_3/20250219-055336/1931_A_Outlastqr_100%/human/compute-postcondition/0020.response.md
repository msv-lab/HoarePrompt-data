Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 3 to 78, `i` is 1, and `word` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `word = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `word`.
- The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `word` based on the value of `n` are not applied because the code snippet only resets `word` to an empty string.
- Therefore, the output state reflects that `word` is now an empty string, while `n` and `i` retain their initial values.
