Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 3 to 78, `i` is 0, `word` is a string containing the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz', and the current value of `n` is greater than 52.**

Explanation:
- `word` is updated by concatenating the character at index `n - 53` from the `alphabet` list and the string 'zz'.
- Since `n` is greater than 52, `n - 53` will be a positive integer within the range 0 to 25, which is a valid index for the `alphabet` list.
- The states of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
- The `word` is no longer an empty string but contains the specified characters.
