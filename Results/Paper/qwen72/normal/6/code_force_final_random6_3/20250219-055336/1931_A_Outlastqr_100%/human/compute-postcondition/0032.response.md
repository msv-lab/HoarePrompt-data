Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 3 to 78, `i` is 2, `word` is the string corresponding to the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string, followed by 'zz'.**

Explanation:
- `n` remains an input integer within the range 3 to 78.
- `i` remains 2.
- `word` is updated to include the character at index `n - 53` from the `alphabet` string, followed by the string 'zz'. For example, if `n` is 55, `word` becomes 'a' + 'zz' = 'azz'.
