Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer within the range 3 to 78, `i` is 2. If `n` > 52, `word` is the string corresponding to the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string, followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `word` is a string containing 'a' followed by the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` list, followed by 'z'. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), `word` is 'aa' + `alphabet[n - 3]`.***
