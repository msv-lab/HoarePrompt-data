Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 3 to 78, `i` is 1, `word` is 'aa' + the nth letter of the alphabet (where n is `n - 3`).**

Explanation: The code appends 'aa' followed by the letter from the alphabet corresponding to the position `n - 3` to the `word` variable. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The `word` variable, which was initially an empty string, now contains 'aa' plus the letter from the alphabet at position `n - 3`.
