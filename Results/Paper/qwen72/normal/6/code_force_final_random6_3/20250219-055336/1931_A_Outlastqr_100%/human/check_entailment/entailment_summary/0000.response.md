Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and then reads each test case's integer `n`.

2. **Alphabet Initialization**: The function initializes the alphabet correctly using `string.ascii_lowercase`, which provides a string of all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: `n > 52`**:
     - The function correctly calculates the lexicographically smallest word by using the character at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. This is because the maximum sum for a word "azz" (1 + 26 + 26 = 53) is 53, so any `n` greater than 52 must use a character with a higher index than 'a' for the first letter.
   - **Case 2: `28 <= n <= 52`**:
     - The function correctly calculates the lexicographically smallest word by using 'a' followed by the character at index `n - 28` and then 'z'. This is because the maximum sum for a word "az" (1 + 26 = 27) is 27, so any `n` between 28 and 52 must use a character with a higher index than 'a' for the second letter.
   - **Case 3: `n == 27`**:
     - The function correctly handles the special case where `n` is 27 by outputting 'aay'. This is because the only way to get a sum of 27 with three letters is 'aay' (1 + 1 + 25 = 27).
   - **Case 4: `3 <= n <= 26`**:
     - The function correctly calculates the lexicographically smallest word by using 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3`. This is because the sum of 'aa' is 2, so the third letter must have an index of `n - 2`.

4. **Output**: The function prints the resulting word for each test case, which is the expected behavior.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles all edge cases within the given range (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle all the specified cases and produce the lexicographically smallest word for each encoded sum.

Correctness: **True**
