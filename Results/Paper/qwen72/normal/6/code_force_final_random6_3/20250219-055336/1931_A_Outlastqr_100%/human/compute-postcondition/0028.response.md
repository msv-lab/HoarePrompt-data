To determine what will be printed by the `print(word)` statement, we need to evaluate the value of `word` based on the given conditions for the input integer `n`.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:

1. **Condition 1: `n` > 52**
   - If `n` is greater than 52, `word` is a string containing the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string followed by 'zz'.
   - For example, if `n` is 53, `word` will be `alphabet[0] + 'zz'`, which is 'a' + 'zz' = 'azz'.
   - If `n` is 54, `word` will be `alphabet[1] + 'zz'`, which is 'b' + 'zz' = 'bzz'.
   - And so on.

2. **Condition 2: `n` > 27 and `n` ≤ 52**
   - If `n` is greater than 27 and less than or equal to 52, `word` is a string 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'.
   - For example, if `n` is 28, `word` will be 'a' + `alphabet[0]` + 'z', which is 'a' + 'a' + 'z' = 'aaz'.
   - If `n` is 29, `word` will be 'a' + `alphabet[1]` + 'z', which is 'a' + 'b' + 'z' = 'abz'.
   - And so on.

3. **Condition 3: `n` is 27**
   - If `n` is exactly 27, `word` is the string 'aay'.

4. **Condition 4: `n` is between 3 and 26**
   - If `n` is between 3 and 26, `word` is a string 'aa' followed by the `(n-3)`th letter of the alphabet.
   - For example, if `n` is 3, `word` will be 'aa' + `alphabet[0]`, which is 'aa' + 'a' = 'aaa'.
   - If `n` is 4, `word` will be 'aa' + `alphabet[1]`, which is 'aa' + 'b' = 'aab'.
   - And so on.

### Final Output:

Given the initial state and the conditions, the `print(word)` statement will output the value of `word` based on the value of `n`:

- If `n` > 52, `word` will be the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string followed by 'zz'.
- If `n` > 27 and `n` ≤ 52, `word` will be 'a' + the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string + 'z'.
- If `n` is 27, `word` will be 'aay'.
- If `n` is between 3 and 26, `word` will be 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3` in the `alphabet` string.

Output: **word (where word is determined by the conditions based on the value of n)**

To provide a more precise description:

- If `n` > 52, Output: **[alphabet[n - 53]]zz**
- If `n` > 27 and `n` ≤ 52, Output: **a[alphabet[n - 28]]z**
- If `n` is 27, Output: **aay**
- If `n` is between 3 and 26, Output: **aa[alphabet[n - 3]]**

For example, if `n` is 55, the output will be 'czz'. If `n` is 30, the output will be 'acz'. If `n` is 27, the output will be 'aay'. If `n` is 5, the output will be 'aad'.
