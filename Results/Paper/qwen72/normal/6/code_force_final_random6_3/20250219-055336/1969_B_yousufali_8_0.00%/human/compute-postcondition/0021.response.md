Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. **`i` is `len(s) - 1`**: This means that `i` is the index of the last element in the list `s`.
2. **`n` is the number of 1s in the list `s`**: This variable `n` counts the total number of 1s in the list `s`.
3. **`ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 in `s` that is preceded by at least one 1**: This means that for each 0 in the list `s`, if there is at least one 1 before it, `ans` will be incremented by `n + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Count the number of 1s in `s`**:
   - `n` is the total number of 1s in the list `s`.

2. **Determine the value of `ans`**:
   - For each 0 in the list `s`, check if there is at least one 1 before it.
   - If there is at least one 1 before a 0, increment `ans` by `n + 1`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example list `s` to illustrate the calculation:
- Suppose `s = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`.

1. **Count the number of 1s**:
   - `n = 3` (since there are three 1s in the list).

2. **Determine the value of `ans`**:
   - The first 0 is at index 1, and there is a 1 before it (at index 0). So, `ans` is incremented by `n + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.
   - The second 0 is at index 3, and there is a 1 before it (at index 2). So, `ans` is incremented by `n + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.
   - The third 0 is at index 5, and there is a 1 before it (at index 4). So, `ans` is incremented by `n + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.

   Therefore, `ans = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12`.

### General Case:
- The value of `ans` depends on the number of 0s in `s` that are preceded by at least one 1.
- For each such 0, `ans` is incremented by `n + 1`, where `n` is the total number of 1s in the list.

### Final Output:
Since the exact list `s` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the value of `ans` calculated as described.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of n + 1 for each 0 in s that is preceded by at least one 1, and n is the number of 1s in the list s)**
