Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Binary String Parsing in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` reads a binary string `s` from the input and converts it into a list of integers.
   - However, the input parsing `list(map(int, input().split()))` is incorrect. The input is a single binary string, not a space-separated list of integers. The correct way to parse the input should be `list(map(int, input().strip()))`.

3. **Logic for Calculating the Minimum Cost**:
   - The variable `n` is used to count the number of 1s in the string.
   - The variable `ans` is used to accumulate the cost of operations.
   - The loop iterates over the string `s` and updates `n` whenever a 1 is encountered.
   - If a 0 is encountered and there have been 1s before it (`n != 0`), the cost `n + 1` is added to `ans`. This is because each 0 that is preceded by 1s requires a cyclic shift of the substring containing the 1s and the 0 to move the 0 to the end of the sorted segment.

4. **Output**:
   - The function `func_1` prints the accumulated cost `ans` after processing the string `s`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the cost should be 0, which the current logic correctly handles.
   - If the string contains only 1s or only 0s, the cost should also be 0, which the current logic correctly handles.

6. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The logic for calculating the cost is based on the idea that each 0 that is preceded by 1s requires a cyclic shift of the substring containing the 1s and the 0. This is a correct approach to minimize the total cost.

However, the input parsing in `func_1` is incorrect, which would lead to incorrect results for the test cases. The correct way to parse the input should be `list(map(int, input().strip()))`.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the input parsing issue in `func_1`. Fixing this issue would make the program correct.
