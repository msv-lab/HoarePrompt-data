Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input format and the logic for calculating the minimum cost to sort the binary string. Specifically:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` expects a list of integers, but the input is a binary string. The `input().split()` method is used to split a string into a list of substrings, which is not appropriate here. Instead, the input should be read as a single string.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost**: The logic in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string. The program increments `ans` by `n + 1` whenever it encounters a `0` and `n` is not zero. This does not follow the problem's requirement to find the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
For the input:
```
5
10
0000
11000
101011
01101001
```
The expected output is:
```
2
0
9
5
11
```
However, the program will produce incorrect results because it does not correctly parse the input as a binary string and does not correctly calculate the minimum cost.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that follows the problem description:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    ones = 0
    cost = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            ones += 1
        else:
            cost += ones
    return cost

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        print(min_cost_to_sort(s))

# Example usage
func_2()
```

This corrected program reads the input correctly as a binary string and calculates the minimum cost to sort the string by counting the number of `1`s before each `0` and summing these counts. This approach ensures that the string is sorted in non-descending order with the minimum total cost.
