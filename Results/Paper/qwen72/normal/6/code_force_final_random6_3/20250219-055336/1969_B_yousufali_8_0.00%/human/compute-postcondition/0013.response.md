Output State: **`s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with a length of at least 2 and at most 200,000, `i` is 1, `n` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is 1, otherwise `n` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `n` + 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is increased by `n + 1`.
- The value of `n` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is 1, otherwise `n` remains unchanged.
- The values of `s` and `i` remain the same as in the initial state.
