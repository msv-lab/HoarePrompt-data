### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the input handling in `func_1` is flawed. The function `func_1` uses `input().split()` which is intended to split a string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. However, the input is a binary string without spaces, so this method will not work as intended. The correct approach would be to read the input as a single string and then convert it to a list of integers if needed.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost**:
   - The original assessment also correctly points out that the logic in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string. The program increments `ans` by `n + 1` whenever it encounters a `0` and `n` is not zero. This logic does not align with the problem's requirement to find the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string.
   - The problem requires counting the number of `1`s before each `0` and summing these counts to get the minimum cost. The original program's logic is incorrect because it adds `n + 1` instead of just `n`.

3. **Example Case**:
   - The original assessment provides an example case where the program fails. For the input:
     ```
     5
     10
     0000
     11000
     101011
     01101001
     ```
     The expected output is:
     ```
     2
     0
     9
     5
     11
     ```
     However, the original program will produce incorrect results due to the issues mentioned above.

4. **Corrected Program**:
   - The corrected program provided in the original assessment is accurate and follows the problem description. It reads the input correctly as a binary string, counts the number of `1`s before each `0`, and sums these counts to get the minimum cost.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the issues with input handling and the incorrect logic for calculating the minimum cost, the original assessment is accurate. The program as written does not solve the problem correctly.

Final: **False**
