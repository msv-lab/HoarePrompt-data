Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the corresponding element in `a` up to that index, and `ans` remains a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The loop variable `i` has reached the value `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `a`.
- The list `last` has grown to be of length `n`, and each element in `last` at index `i` represents the index of the last occurrence of the element `a[i]` up to that point in the list `a`. If the element `a[i]` is different from `a[i-1]`, then `last[i]` is `i`. If `a[i]` is the same as `a[i-1]`, then `last[i]` is the same as `last[i-1]`.
- The list `ans` remains unchanged, with all its elements still set to -1, as the loop does not modify `ans`.
