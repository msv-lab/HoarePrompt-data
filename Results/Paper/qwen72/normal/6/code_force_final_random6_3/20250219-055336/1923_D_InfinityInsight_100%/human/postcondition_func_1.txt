The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of integers and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element is either -1 or a value calculated based on the conditions within the function. Specifically, for each index `i` in the list `a` (starting from 1 to `n-1`), if `a[i]` is not less than `a[i-1]` and the index of the last occurrence of `a[i-1]` (stored in `last`) is less than the index found by a function `func_1` applied to the cumulative sum list `left` and a calculated value `x`, then `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` remains -1.
