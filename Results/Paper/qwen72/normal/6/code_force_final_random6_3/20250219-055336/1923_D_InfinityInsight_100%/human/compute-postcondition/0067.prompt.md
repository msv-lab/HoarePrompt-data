You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9, and n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5.
def func_2(a, n):
    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
        
    #State: `i` is `n-1`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the corresponding element in `a` up to that index, and `ans` remains a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1.
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
        
    #State: `a` must be a non-empty list, `i` is the last element in `a`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the corresponding element in `a` up to that index, `ans` remains a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, `left` is a list with `len(a) + 1` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the corresponding index.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
        
    #State: `a` is a non-empty list, `i` is the last element in `a`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the corresponding element in `a` up to that index, `ans` is a list of length `n` with elements set to `i + 1 - inx` for each index `i` where the loop condition `a[i] < a[i - 1]` is not met and `inx2 < inx`, otherwise elements remain -1, `left` is a list with `len(a) + 1` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the corresponding index, `n` is the length of the list `a`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the list `ans` of length `n` where each element is set to `i + 1 - inx` for each index `i` where the loop condition `a[i] < a[i - 1]` is not met and `inx2 < inx`, otherwise elements remain -1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `a` of integers and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element is `i + 1 - inx` if the condition `a[i] < a[i - 1]` is not met and `inx2 < inx` for the index `i`, otherwise the element remains -1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `ans` of length `n` where each element is set to `i + 1 - inx` for each index `i` where the loop condition `a[i] < a[i - 1]` is not met and `inx2 < inx`, otherwise elements remain -1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
