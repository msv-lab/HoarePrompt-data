### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a line of slimes, each with a specific size.
   - Each second, a slime can eat one of its neighbors if it is strictly larger than the neighbor.
   - We need to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten, or report -1 if it is impossible.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is used to find the index of the first element in a list `a` that is greater than or equal to a given value `x`.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the slimes and calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.

3. **Breaking Down `func_1`:**
   - `func_1(a, x)` uses `bisect_left` to find the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1.
   - If the element at the found index is exactly `x`, it returns `inx + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `inx`.

4. **Breaking Down `func_2`:**
   - `func_2(a, n)` processes the list `a` of size `n`.
   - It initializes `left` and `last` lists to keep track of cumulative sums and the last index of the same size slime, respectively.
   - It initializes `ans` with -1 for all slimes, indicating that initially, no slime is eaten.
   - It iterates through the slimes:
     - If the current slime `a[i]` is smaller than the previous slime `a[i - 1]`, it sets `ans[i]` to 1, meaning the current slime can be eaten by the previous slime in one second.
     - Otherwise, it calculates `x` as the cumulative sum of slimes up to `i` minus the size of the current slime minus 1.
     - It uses `func_1` to find the index `inx` of the first cumulative sum that is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - It also finds `inx2` as the last index of the same size slime before `i`.
     - If `inx2` is less than `inx`, it updates `inx` to `inx2`.
     - If `inx` is less than 0, it continues to the next iteration.
     - Otherwise, it sets `ans[i]` to `i + 1 - inx`, which is the minimum number of seconds it takes for the current slime to be eaten.

5. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where a slime is smaller than its previous neighbor.
   - The cumulative sum and the last index of the same size slime are used to determine the minimum number of seconds for a slime to be eaten.
   - The use of `bisect_left` ensures efficient searching for the cumulative sum.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle cases where no slime can be eaten (e.g., all slimes are the same size).
   - It should also handle cases where the slimes are in a configuration that prevents some slimes from being eaten.

7. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program seems to correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.
   - The use of cumulative sums and the `bisect_left` function is appropriate for the problem.
