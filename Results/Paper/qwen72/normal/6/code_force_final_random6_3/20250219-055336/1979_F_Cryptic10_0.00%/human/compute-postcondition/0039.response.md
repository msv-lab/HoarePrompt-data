Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` is a list that includes `v` and at most one other vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set, `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one vertex, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`, `v` has been removed from `remaining_vertices`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
