The only objects in the loop head are the variables `d` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over `d` starting from `n - 1` and decreases `d` by 1 until it reaches -1. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is `n - 2`, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be decreased by 1 to `n - 3`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 3`, and `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `remaining_vertices` no longer includes the current value of `v`, and `path` is a list that now includes the current value of `v`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` or if `v` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
