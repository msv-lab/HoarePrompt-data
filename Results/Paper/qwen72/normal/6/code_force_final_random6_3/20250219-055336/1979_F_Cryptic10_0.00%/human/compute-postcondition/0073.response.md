Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 2`, `path` is a list that now includes `v` and at most one other vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set, `remaining_vertices` no longer contains `v` but still contains at least one vertex, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
