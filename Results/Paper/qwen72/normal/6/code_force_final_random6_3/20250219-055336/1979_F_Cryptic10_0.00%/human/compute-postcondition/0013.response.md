The loop head contains the variables `d` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables. The loop iterates in reverse, starting from `n - 1` and decrementing `d` by 1 each time until `d` is -1.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `d` is `n - 1`.
- `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `d` must be decremented by 1, so `d` will be `n - 2`.
- `n` must remain the same, as it is the upper bound of the loop and does not change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 2`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `remaining_vertices` no longer includes the current value of `v`, and `path` is a list that now includes the current value of `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
