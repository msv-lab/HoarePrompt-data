### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves finding a Hamiltonian path in a graph that initially is a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices, from which \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed.
   - The solution must use at most \( n \) queries to the judge, each of which returns a vertex \( v \) with a degree at least \( d \) and another vertex \( u \) not connected to \( v \).

2. **Interaction Protocol:**
   - The query format is `"? d"`, and the response is a pair of integers \((v, u)\).
   - If no vertex with a degree at least \( d \) is found, the response is \((0, 0)\).
   - If a vertex \( v \) is found, it is removed from the graph along with all its edges.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `path` and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from 1 to \( n \).
   - It enters a loop that continues until `remaining_vertices` is empty.
   - For each degree \( d \) from \( n-1 \) down to 0, it makes a query to find a vertex \( v \) with a degree at least \( d \) and another vertex \( u \) not connected to \( v \).
   - If \( v \) is found and is still in `remaining_vertices`, it adds \( v \) to the `path` and removes \( v \) from `remaining_vertices`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly handles the query responses and updates the `path` and `remaining_vertices` accordingly.
   - By starting with the highest degree and working down, the algorithm ensures that it finds a vertex with the minimum degree that meets the criteria.
   - The removal of vertices and edges is done correctly, and the program ensures that it does not exceed the \( n \) query limit.
   - The final path is printed in the correct format, and the output is flushed to ensure proper interaction with the judge.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no vertex with a degree at least \( d \) is found by continuing to the next degree.
   - It also handles the case where the graph is fully processed and `remaining_vertices` is empty by breaking out of the loop and printing the path.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The algorithm makes at most \( n \) queries, which is within the allowed limit.
   - The time complexity is \( O(n^2) \) in the worst case, but this is acceptable given the constraints.

### Validation of Annotations:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - For `func_1(d)`, \( d \) is a non-negative integer such that \( 0 \le d \le n - 1 \).
  - For `func_2(n)`, \( n \) is an integer such that \( 2 \le n \le 10^5 \).

- **Behavior of `func_1(d)`:**
  - It prints the query `"? d"`.
  - It reads the response \((v, u)\) and returns it.
  - The response \((v, u)\) is correctly handled and returned.

- **Behavior of `func_2(n)`:**
  - It initializes `path` and `remaining_vertices`.
  - It enters a loop that continues until `remaining_vertices` is empty.
  - For each degree \( d \) from \( n-1 \) down to 0, it makes a query using `func_1(d)`.
  - If \( v \) is found and is still in `remaining_vertices`, it adds \( v \) to the `path` and removes \( v \) from `remaining_vertices`.
  - The loop ensures that the program continues to find and remove vertices until all vertices are processed.
  - The final path is printed in the correct format, and the output is flushed.

### Final Evaluation:

The program correctly implements the algorithm to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using the allowed number of queries. The logic and interaction with the judge are handled appropriately, and the edge cases are correctly managed. The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state and behavior throughout its execution.

Final: **True**
