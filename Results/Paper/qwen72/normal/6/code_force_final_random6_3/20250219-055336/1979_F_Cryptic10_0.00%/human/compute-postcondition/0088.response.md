Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `path` is a list that includes all vertices from the initial `remaining_vertices` set, and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call ensures that any buffered output is written to the console immediately, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
