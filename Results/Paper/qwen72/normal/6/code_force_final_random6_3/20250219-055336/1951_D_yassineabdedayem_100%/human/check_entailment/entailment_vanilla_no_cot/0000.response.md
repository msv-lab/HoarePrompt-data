Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly addresses the problem by determining if Bob can set up the stalls in such a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. If `n` is equal to `k`, then Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up just one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. This is because Alice will buy `n` jewels (which is equal to `k` in this case) and spend all her coins.

2. If `n + 2` is greater than `2 * k`, then it is possible to set up two stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The first stall is set to a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel, and the second stall is set to 1 coin per jewel. This ensures that Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling `k` jewels.

3. If neither of the above conditions is met, then it is impossible to set up the stalls in such a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, and the program outputs "NO".

The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements, and the output format matches the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
