Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` and `k` are input integers.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The current value of `n + 2` is greater than the current value of `k * 2`.

The print statement is:
```
print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
```

Let's break down the values and the output:

1. **`n - k + 1`**:
   - `n` and `k` are integers.
   - Since `n + 2 > k * 2`, we can infer that `n > 2k - 2`.
   - The expression `n - k + 1` will be evaluated as the difference between `n` and `k`, plus 1.

2. **`end=' '`**:
   - This means that the output will be followed by a space instead of a newline.

Given the conditions, the value of `n - k + 1` will be a positive integer because:
- `n > 2k - 2` implies `n - k > k - 2`.
- Since `n` and `k` are integers and `n` is not equal to `k`, `n - k` is at least 1 (if `n` is just greater than `k`).

Therefore, `n - k + 1` will always be a positive integer greater than 1.

Output: **n - k + 1 (where n - k + 1 is a positive integer greater than 1)**
