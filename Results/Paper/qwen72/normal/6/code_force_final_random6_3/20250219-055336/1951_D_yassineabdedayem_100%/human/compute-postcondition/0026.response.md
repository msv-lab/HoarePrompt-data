The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the conditions and values of variables `t`, `_`, `n`, and `k`, but these conditions do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or conditions.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
