Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 2.
2. `_` is 2.
3. `n` and `k` are new input integers.
4. If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition `n == k` holds.
5. If `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds.
6. Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'NO'`.
- The initial state provides conditions involving `n` and `k`, but the `print` statement does not depend on these conditions. It always prints the string `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **NO**
