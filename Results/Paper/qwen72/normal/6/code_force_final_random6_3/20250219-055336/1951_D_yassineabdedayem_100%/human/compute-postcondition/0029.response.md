The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `t` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are the new input integers. If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition `n == k` holds. If `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds. Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.**
