Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are the last set of input integers. If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition `n == k` holds. If `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds. Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` is reduced to 0 because the loop has run `t` times. The variable `_` is equal to `t - 1` because it increments with each iteration of the loop. The variables `n` and `k` hold the values of the last set of integers read from the input. If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition `n == k` is true. If `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` is true. Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.
