Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the program fails to consider cases where `k` is greater than 1 and `n` is less than `k`, which should always result in "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels with fewer than `k` coins. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 5
```
Here, Alice has 3 coins and Bob wants her to buy 5 jewels. Since Alice cannot buy more than 3 jewels with 3 coins, the correct output should be "NO". However, the program will incorrectly output:
```
YES
2
3 1
```
This is incorrect because Alice can only buy 3 jewels in total, not 5.

Additionally, the program does not handle cases where `k` is greater than 60, which should also result in "NO" because Bob can only set up at most 60 stalls. For example:
```
1
100 61
```
The program will output:
```
YES
2
40 1
```
This is incorrect because Alice can only buy 2 jewels in total, not 61, and Bob cannot set up more than 60 stalls.

These examples demonstrate that the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
