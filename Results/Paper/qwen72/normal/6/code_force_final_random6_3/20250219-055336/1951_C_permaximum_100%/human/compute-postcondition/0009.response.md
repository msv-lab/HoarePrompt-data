Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. `pq` is a heap with one less element than before. `total_cost` is now `price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` is 0. `price` is the smallest price in the heap before the operation plus `price_increase`. `day` is the index of this smallest price in the `prices` list. `price_increase` is 0. `tickets_to_buy` is min(m, k - tickets_bought).**

Explanation:
- `total_cost` is updated by adding `price * tickets_to_buy` to its previous value (which was 0).
- The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `pq`, `tickets_bought`, `price`, `day`, and `price_increase` remain unchanged.
- `tickets_to_buy` is still calculated as `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, but since `tickets_bought` is 0, `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k)`.
