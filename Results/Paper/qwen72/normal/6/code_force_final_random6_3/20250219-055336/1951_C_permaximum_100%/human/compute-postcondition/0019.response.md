The variable in the loop head is `tickets_bought`, which needs to be less than `k` for the loop to execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `tickets_bought` was updated to `tickets_bought + min(m, k - tickets_bought)`. For the loop to execute again, `tickets_bought` must still be less than `k`.

Given the current state:
- `tickets_bought` is `tickets_bought + min(m, k - tickets_bought)`
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`. Since `tickets_bought` was updated by adding `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, the loop can execute again if `tickets_bought + min(m, k - tickets_bought)` is still less than `k`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute one more time, as the condition `tickets_bought < k` will still hold true if `tickets_bought + min(m, k - tickets_bought) < k`.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. `pq` is a heap with one less element than before. `price` is the smallest price in the heap before the operation plus `tickets_to_buy`. `day` is the index of this smallest price in the `prices` list. `total_cost` is now `price * tickets_to_buy` plus the previous `total_cost`. `tickets_bought` is `tickets_bought + min(m, k - tickets_bought)`. `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`**.
