### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices for each day.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) `pq` with tuples of the form `(price, day)`, where `price` is the ticket price on a given day and `day` is the index of that day.
   - This ensures that the smallest price is always at the top of the heap.

3. **Heap Operations**:
   - The program uses a while loop to continue purchasing tickets until the total number of tickets bought (`tickets_bought`) reaches `k`.
   - In each iteration, it pops the smallest price from the heap and adds the current `price_increase` to it.
   - It then calculates the number of tickets to buy on that day, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets that can be bought per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - The total cost is updated by adding the cost of the tickets bought on that day.
   - The number of tickets bought is incremented by the number of tickets purchased.
   - The `price_increase` is also incremented by the number of tickets purchased.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop completes, the program prints the total cost for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly uses a min-heap to always buy the cheapest available tickets first.
  - It correctly handles the price increase for subsequent days based on the number of tickets bought.
  - The program ensures that the total number of tickets bought is exactly `k` and that the total cost is minimized.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where `k` is less than or equal to `m` (i.e., all tickets can be bought in one day).
  - It also handles cases where `k` is much larger than `m`, requiring multiple days to buy all tickets.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The use of a heap ensures that the program efficiently finds the minimum price each time, which is crucial for large inputs.
  - The time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the heap operations, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
