Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly k tickets under the given constraints. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the program and why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of days `n`, the maximum tickets per day `m`, and the total tickets to buy `k`. It also reads the list of ticket prices for each day.

2. **Priority Queue Initialization**: The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with the ticket prices and their corresponding days. This ensures that the lowest price is always at the top of the heap.

3. **Heap Operations**: The program uses a while loop to buy tickets until the total number of tickets bought equals `k`. In each iteration:
   - It pops the lowest price from the heap.
   - It increases the price by the cumulative price increase (`price_increase`).
   - It calculates the number of tickets to buy on the current day, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - It adds the cost of the tickets bought to the total cost.
   - It updates the number of tickets bought and the cumulative price increase.

4. **Output**: The program prints the total cost for each test case.

The logic ensures that the tickets are bought at the lowest possible prices, taking into account the price increases due to previous purchases. This approach is efficient and handles the constraints provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
