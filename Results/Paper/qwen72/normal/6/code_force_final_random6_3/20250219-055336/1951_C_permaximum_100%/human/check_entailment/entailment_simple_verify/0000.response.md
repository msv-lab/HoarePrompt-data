Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It reads `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case and the list of ticket prices `prices`.

2. **Priority Queue (Min-Heap)**: The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with the initial prices and their corresponding days. This ensures that the day with the lowest current ticket price is always selected first, which is a good strategy for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Price Increase Mechanism**: The program correctly updates the `price_increase` variable each time tickets are bought. This variable is then added to the price of the ticket for the selected day before calculating the cost of the tickets bought. This accurately reflects the price increase mechanism described in the problem.

4. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: The program ensures that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day and that the total number of tickets bought does not exceed `k`. This is achieved by the line `tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)`. This logic is correct and aligns with the problem constraints.

5. **Total Cost Calculation**: The total cost is calculated by multiplying the current price of the ticket by the number of tickets bought on that day and adding it to `total_cost`. This is done correctly within the loop.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles several edge cases:
   - When `k` is less than or equal to `m`, all tickets can be bought in one day.
   - When `k` is greater than `m`, tickets need to be bought over multiple days.
   - When the number of days `n` is 1, the program will buy all `k` tickets on that single day, which is correct.

However, there is a subtle issue with the way the priority queue is used. The program does not re-heapify the prices after they are increased. This means that the priority queue might not always contain the correct lowest prices after the price increase. Specifically, once a price is increased, it should be reinserted into the heap with the new price to ensure the heap property is maintained.

To illustrate this issue, consider the following example:
- `prices = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5]`
- `m = 2`
- `k = 3`

The program will:
1. Buy 2 tickets on day 1 with cost 2, and the prices become [3, 3, 8, 4, 5].
2. Buy 1 ticket on day 2 with cost 3, and the prices become [4, 4, 8, 4, 5].

However, the priority queue will not reflect the updated prices correctly, and the program might incorrectly choose the next day to buy tickets.

To fix this, the program should reinsert the updated price back into the heap after the price increase. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import heapq

def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    pq = [(price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        # Reinsert the updated price back into the heap
        heapq.heappush(pq, (price, day))
    return total_cost
```

Given the original program's issue with maintaining the heap property, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
