Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days with a maximum of `m` tickets that can be bought per day, while minimizing the total cost. The prices per ticket for each day are provided in the `prices` list, and the price per ticket increases by the number of tickets bought on that day for all subsequent days.

The program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always select the cheapest ticket available. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Heap Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with the ticket prices and their corresponding days.
3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - It initializes `total_cost` to 0, `tickets_bought` to 0, and `price_increase` to 0.
   - It enters a loop that continues until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
   - In each iteration, it pops the cheapest ticket from the heap, adds the current `price_increase` to the ticket price, and calculates the number of tickets to buy (`tickets_to_buy`), which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets that can be bought per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - It updates the `total_cost` by adding the cost of the tickets bought on that day.
   - It updates `tickets_bought` by adding the number of tickets bought.
   - It updates `price_increase` by adding the number of tickets bought.

4. **Output**: After all tickets are bought, the total cost is printed for each test case.

The logic ensures that the program always buys the cheapest tickets first, which is a key requirement for minimizing the total cost. The use of a priority queue (min-heap) ensures that the program efficiently selects the lowest price available at each step.

Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic and should handle all valid inputs as described.

Correctness: **True**
