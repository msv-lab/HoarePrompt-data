#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). prices is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.

    #State: `total_cost` is the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets, `tickets_bought` is `k`, `price_increase` is the total number of tickets bought, and `pq` is a heap with `n` elements reduced by the number of elements that have been popped.
    return total_cost
    #The program returns the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. It calculates and returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, where each ticket type has a price specified in the `prices` list. The function ensures that the total cost is minimized by buying tickets from the cheapest available ticket types first, and the price of each ticket type increases by the number of tickets bought from that type. After the function concludes, `k` tickets have been bought, and the total cost of these tickets is returned.
