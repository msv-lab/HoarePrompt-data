Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. `pq` is now a heap (a list of tuples where each tuple contains (price, index) for each price in the `prices` list, and the index is the position of the price in the `prices` list). `total_cost` is 0. `tickets_bought` is 0.**

The variable `tickets_bought` is initialized to 0, and the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.
