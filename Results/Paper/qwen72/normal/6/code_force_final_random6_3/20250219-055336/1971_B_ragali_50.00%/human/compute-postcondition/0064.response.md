Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` contains all its original characters with leading and trailing spaces removed.
   - `i` has iterated through each character in `s` and is now incremented by 1.
   - `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s`.
   - `t` must be greater than the current value of `i`.
   - The set `a` contains more than one unique character.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides information about the variables `s`, `i`, `a`, and `t`, but none of these variables are used in the print statement.
   - Therefore, the print statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `s`, `i`, `a`, and `t`.

4. **Output:**
   Output: **YES**
