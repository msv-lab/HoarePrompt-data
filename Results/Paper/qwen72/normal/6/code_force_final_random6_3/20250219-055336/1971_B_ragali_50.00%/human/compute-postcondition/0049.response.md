Postcondition: ***`s` contains all its original characters (with leading and trailing spaces removed), `a` contains all unique characters from `s`, `i` has iterated through each character in `s`, and the length of `a` is greater than 1. `isreverse` is a string that is the reverse of `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, the program continues with these conditions. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `isreverse` is also equal to `s`.***
