To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), with each integer from 1 to `n` appearing at most twice.
- The input to file descriptor `0` (standard input) must contain at least 3 lines.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Reading the Input:**
   - The code snippet assumes that `line` is a string read from the input. Since the input must contain at least 3 lines, `line` could be any of these lines.
   - For the purpose of this analysis, let's assume `line` is a string of space-separated integers.

2. **Splitting the Line:**
   - `line.split()` splits the string `line` into a list of tokens (substrings) based on whitespace.
   - For example, if `line` is "1 2 3 4 5", then `tokens` will be `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']`.

3. **Counting Tokens:**
   - `len(tokens)` gives the number of tokens in the list.
   - For the example above, `len(tokens)` would be 5.

4. **Creating a Set of Tokens:**
   - `{*tokens}` creates a set from the list of tokens, which removes any duplicate tokens.
   - For the example above, `{*tokens}` would be `{'1', '2', '3', '4', '5'}`, and `len({*tokens})` would also be 5.

5. **Calculating the Difference:**
   - The expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` calculates the difference between the number of tokens and the number of unique tokens.
   - This difference represents the number of duplicate tokens in the list.

### Example Calculation:
- If `line` is "1 2 3 4 5", then:
  - `tokens` = `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']`
  - `len(tokens)` = 5
  - `{*tokens}` = `{'1', '2', '3', '4', '5'}`
  - `len({*tokens})` = 5
  - `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` = 5 - 5 = 0

- If `line` is "1 2 2 3 3", then:
  - `tokens` = `['1', '2', '2', '3', '3']`
  - `len(tokens)` = 5
  - `{*tokens}` = `{'1', '2', '3'}`
  - `len({*tokens})` = 3
  - `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` = 5 - 3 = 2

### Final Output:
The code snippet will print the number of duplicate tokens in the line. Since the exact content of `line` is not provided, we can describe the output in general terms.

Output: **number of duplicate tokens in the line (where the line is a string of space-separated integers read from the input)**
