The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. Here, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters. However, the specific output is not provided in the problem statement. Given the constraints and the typical nature of such functions, it is likely that the function processes the list `a` in some way and returns a result relevant to the properties of the list, such as identifying unique elements, counting occurrences, or performing some other operation that adheres to the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers. It returns a result based on the properties of the list `a` for each test case, ensuring that each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
