Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not implement the game logic as described in the problem. Instead, it simply calculates the difference between the number of cards and the number of unique cards in each hand, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of points a player can get by playing optimally. The game involves strategic decisions based on the cards on the table and the cards in each player's hand, which the program does not account for. Therefore, the program does not solve the problem correctly.

Final: **False**
