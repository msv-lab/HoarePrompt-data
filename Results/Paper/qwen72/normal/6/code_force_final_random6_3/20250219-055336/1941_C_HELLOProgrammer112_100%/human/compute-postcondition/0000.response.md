To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop variable, and the expression `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable `_`**: This variable is not used in the loop body, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
2. **Expression `int(input())`**: This expression determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

### Adjusted State:
- The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.
- The loop variable `_` will start from 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
