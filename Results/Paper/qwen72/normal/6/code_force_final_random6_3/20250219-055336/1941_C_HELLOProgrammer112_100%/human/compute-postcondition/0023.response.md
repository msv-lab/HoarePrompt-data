Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` and a string `s` from the input. It then calculates the number of times the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' appear in `s`, and prints the result of `x + y - z`, where `x` is the count of 'map', `y` is the count of 'pie', and `z` is the count of 'mapie'. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the input stream is fully consumed, and the final printed results correspond to the calculations for each test case. **
