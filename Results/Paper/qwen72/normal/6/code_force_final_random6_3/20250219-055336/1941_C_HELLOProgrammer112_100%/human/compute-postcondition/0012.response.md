Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`**

Explanation:
- The code `z = s.count('mapie')` updates the value of `z` to the number of times the substring 'mapie' appears in the string `s`.
- The values of `int(input())`, `_`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- The initial state specifies that `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`, and the code directly updates `z` to this value. Therefore, the output state reflects this update.
