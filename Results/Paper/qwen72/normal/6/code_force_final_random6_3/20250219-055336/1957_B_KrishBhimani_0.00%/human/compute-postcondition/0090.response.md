Output State: **`i` is the third element in `arr`, `arr` must contain at least 3 elements, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 3, and `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` and `1 << i`.**

The code snippet `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` initially contains the value `1 << i`, after the code is executed, `ans` will contain two instances of `1 << i`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
