You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        ans = []
        c = 0
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Instead, it reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the result. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`. The function then generates a list `ans` of length `n` such that the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k`. The elements in `ans` are powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of the set bits in the binary representation of `k`, with any remaining positions filled with 0. If the sum of the generated powers of 2 is less than `k`, the last element in `ans` is adjusted to ensure the total sum equals `k`. The function prints the elements of `ans` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Bitwise Analysis:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k`.
   - It iterates through the bits of `k` using a while loop. For each bit that is set to 1, it appends the bit position to `arr`.
   - This step ensures that we have identified all the positions of 1s in the binary representation of `k`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the resulting sequence.
   - It also initializes a counter `c` to keep track of the number of elements added to `ans`.
   - The program then iterates through the bit positions stored in `arr`.
   - For each bit position `i`, it adds `1 << i` to `ans` (which is equivalent to `2^i`), ensuring that the resulting sequence has the maximum number of 1s in its bitwise OR.
   - If the counter `c` reaches `n - 1`, it appends the remaining value `k0 - sum(ans)` to `ans` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.

4. **Padding with Zeros:**
   - After constructing the sequence, the program pads it with zeros to ensure the length of `ans` is exactly `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sequence `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Sum Condition:**
  - The program ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `k` by adding the remaining value `k0 - sum(ans)` when `c` reaches `n - 1`.
  - This ensures that the sum condition is always satisfied.

- **Maximizing the Number of 1s:**
  - The program constructs the sequence by setting the bits that are set in `k` to 1 in the sequence.
  - This approach ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s, as it directly uses the bits from `k`.

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - If `n` is 1, the program will output `k` directly, which is correct.
  - If `n` is greater than the number of 1s in the binary representation of `k`, the program will pad the sequence with zeros, which is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
