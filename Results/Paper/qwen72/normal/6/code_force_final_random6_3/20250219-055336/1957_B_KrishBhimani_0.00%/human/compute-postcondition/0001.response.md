Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.** 

The input is split into a list of strings and assigned to `l1`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
