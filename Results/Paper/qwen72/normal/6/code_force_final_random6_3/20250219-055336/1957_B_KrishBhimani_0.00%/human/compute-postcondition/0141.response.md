Output State: **The loop has executed the specified number of times, and for each iteration, the following conditions hold: `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `c` is the number of elements in `arr`, and `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to the point where `c` equals `n - 1`. If `c` equals `n - 1` before the loop finishes, the last element in `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`. Any remaining elements in `ans` are 0.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the loop has processed the specified number of test cases. For each test case, the variables `n` and `k0` are derived from the input, and the loop constructs a list `arr` containing the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`. The variable `k` is reduced to 0 by the end of the loop, and `i` is the last index in `arr`. The list `ans` is constructed such that it contains the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to the point where the length of `ans` is `n - 1`. If the length of `ans` reaches `n - 1` before all elements in `arr` are processed, the last element of `ans` is set to `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`. If there are fewer elements in `arr` than `n`, the remaining elements in `ans` are filled with zeros to make the length of `ans` equal to `n`. The final state of `ans` is printed for each test case.
