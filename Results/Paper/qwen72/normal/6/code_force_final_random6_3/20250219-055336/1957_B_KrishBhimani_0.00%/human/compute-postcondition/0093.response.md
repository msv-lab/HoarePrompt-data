Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is the last element in `arr`.
2. `arr` must contain at least one element.
3. `n` is the first integer from `l1`.
4. `k` is 0.
5. `k0` is the second integer from `l1`.
6. `c` is the number of elements in `arr`.
7. `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to the point where `c` equals `n - 1`.
8. If `c` equals `n - 1` before the loop finishes, the last element in `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)`.
9. `ans` is extended by appending zeros until its length equals `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `i` and `arr`:**
   - `i` is the last element in `arr`.
   - `arr` must contain at least one element.

2. **Determine `n` and `k0`:**
   - `n` is the first integer from `l1`.
   - `k0` is the second integer from `l1`.

3. **Determine `c`:**
   - `c` is the number of elements in `arr`.

4. **Construct `ans`:**
   - `ans` is initially an empty list.
   - For each element `i` in `arr`, compute `1 << i` and append it to `ans`.
   - This continues until the length of `ans` (which is `c`) equals `n - 1`.
   - If `c` equals `n - 1` before the loop finishes, the last element in `ans` is set to `k0 - sum(ans)`.
   - After this, `ans` is extended by appending zeros until its length equals `n`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume:
- `arr = [1, 2, 3]`
- `l1 = [4, 10]`

1. **Determine `i` and `arr`:**
   - `i` is the last element in `arr`, so `i = 3`.

2. **Determine `n` and `k0`:**
   - `n` is the first integer from `l1`, so `n = 4`.
   - `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, so `k0 = 10`.

3. **Determine `c`:**
   - `c` is the number of elements in `arr`, so `c = 3`.

4. **Construct `ans`:**
   - Initialize `ans` as an empty list: `ans = []`.
   - Compute `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr`:
     - For `i = 1`, `1 << 1 = 2`, so `ans = [2]`.
     - For `i = 2`, `1 << 2 = 4`, so `ans = [2, 4]`.
     - For `i = 3`, `1 << 3 = 8`, so `ans = [2, 4, 8]`.
   - The length of `ans` is now 3, which is `n - 1` (since `n = 4`).
   - The last element in `ans` is set to `k0 - sum(ans)`.
     - `sum(ans) = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14`.
     - `k0 - sum(ans) = 10 - 14 = -4`.
     - So, `ans = [2, 4, 8, -4]`.

5. **Extend `ans` with zeros:**
   - The length of `ans` is already `n = 4`, so no zeros are appended.

### Final Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

Output: **2 4 8 -4**
