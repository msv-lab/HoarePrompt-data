Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`. `arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`. `n` is the first integer from `l1`. `k` is 0. `k0` is the second integer from `l1`. `ans` is an empty list. `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    if c == n - 1:
        ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
        break
    c += 1
    ans.append(1 << i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is the first element in `arr`, `arr` must contain at least one element, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `ans` is a list containing the value `1 << i`, `c` is 1. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing the value `k0 - 0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains a list containing the value `1 << i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is the second element in `arr`, `arr` must contain at least two elements, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 2, and `ans` is a list containing the value `1 << i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the third element in `arr`, `arr` must contain at least 3 elements, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 3, and `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` and `1 << i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
