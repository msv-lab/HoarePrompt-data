Postcondition: ***`i` is the third element in `arr`, `arr` must contain at least 3 elements, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 2, and `ans` is a list containing the value `1 << i`. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `k0 - sum(ans)` is calculated and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
