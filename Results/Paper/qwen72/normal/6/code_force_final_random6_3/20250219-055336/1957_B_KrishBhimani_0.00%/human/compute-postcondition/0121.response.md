Output State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 0, `ans` is a list containing a single element which is `k0`, and `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input. The current value of `c` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the result of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`.
- Initially, `ans` is an empty list, so `sum(ans)` is 0.
- Therefore, `k0 - sum(ans)` simplifies to `k0 - 0`, which is just `k0`.
- After the code execution, `ans` now contains a single element, which is `k0`.
- The values of `arr`, `i`, `k`, `k0`, `c`, and `l1` remain unchanged.
