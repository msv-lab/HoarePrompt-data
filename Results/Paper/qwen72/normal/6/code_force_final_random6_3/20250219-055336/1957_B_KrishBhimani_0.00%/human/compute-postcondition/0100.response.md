The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is truthy (i.e., non-zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `k` is the second integer from `l1`. For the loop to execute the first time, `k` must be non-zero.

State: **`arr` is an empty list, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1` and must be non-zero, `i` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
