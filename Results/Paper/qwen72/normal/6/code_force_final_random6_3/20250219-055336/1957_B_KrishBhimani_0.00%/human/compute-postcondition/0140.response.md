Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`.
2. `i` is the last element of `arr`.
3. `k` is 0.
4. `k0` is the second integer from `l1`.
5. `c` is the number of elements in `arr`.
6. `ans` is a list containing elements where each element is `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr`.
7. If `c` is `n - 1`, the last element of `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`.
8. The length of `ans` is now `n`, with the additional elements being 0.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `k0`**:
   - `k0` is the second integer from `l1`. Since `l1` is not explicitly provided, we can only refer to it as `k0`.

2. **Determine `arr`**:
   - `arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`.
   - For example, if `k0` is 13 (binary 1101), `arr` would be [0, 2, 3].

3. **Determine `i`**:
   - `i` is the last element of `arr`.
   - For the example above, `i` would be 3.

4. **Determine `c`**:
   - `c` is the number of elements in `arr`.
   - For the example above, `c` would be 3.

5. **Determine `ans`**:
   - `ans` is a list where each element is `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr`.
   - For the example above, `ans` would be [1, 4, 8] (since `1 << 0` is 1, `1 << 2` is 4, and `1 << 3` is 8).

6. **Check the condition for the last element of `ans`**:
   - If `c` is `n - 1`, the last element of `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`.
   - For the example above, if `n` is 4, then `c` is 3, which is `n - 1`.
   - Therefore, the last element of `ans` would be `13 - (1 + 4 + 8) = 0`.

7. **Determine the final length of `ans`**:
   - The length of `ans` is now `n`, with the additional elements being 0.
   - For the example above, `ans` would be [1, 4, 8, 0].

### Final Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

Output: **1 4 8 0 (where the elements of `ans` are determined based on the binary representation of `k0` and the condition that the last element is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])` if `c` is `n - 1`, with the additional elements being 0)**
