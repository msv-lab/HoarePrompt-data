Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1` and must be greater than or equal to the number of bits in `k`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `arr` must have at least three elements, `c` is 2, `ans` now contains the element `1 << i` appended to its previous contents. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` also contains `k0 - sum(ans)` appended to its previous contents, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
