The value of `k` is right-shifted by 1, which means `k` is divided by 2 and the result is rounded down to the nearest integer. The values of `i`, `arr`, `n`, `k0`, `ans`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `arr` contains `[2]` if `k0` was an even number before the shift, or `[0, 2]` if `k0` was an odd number before the shift, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is `k // 2`, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `ans` has been extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`, and `c` is equal to `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking early, otherwise `c` is less than `n - 1`.**
