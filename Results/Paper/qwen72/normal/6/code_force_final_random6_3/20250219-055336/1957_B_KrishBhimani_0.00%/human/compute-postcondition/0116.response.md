Output State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, `k` is 0, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, and `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**

### Explanation:
- **`arr`**: This list will contain the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`. For example, if `k0` is 13 (binary `1101`), `arr` will be `[0, 2, 3]` because the 0th, 2nd, and 3rd bits are set to 1.
- **`k`**: After the loop finishes, `k` will be 0 because the loop continues to right-shift `k` until it becomes 0.
- **`i`**: This will be the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`. For example, if `k0` is 13 (binary `1101`), `i` will be 4 after the loop finishes.
- **`k0`**: This remains unchanged as it is the second integer from `l1`.
- **`c`**: This remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`ans`**: This remains an empty list as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`l1`**: This remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
