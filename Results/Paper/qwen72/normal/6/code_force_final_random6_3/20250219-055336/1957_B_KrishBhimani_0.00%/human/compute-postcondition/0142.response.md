The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 2 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer in the range 1 to 10^9. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the exact return value is not specified.**
