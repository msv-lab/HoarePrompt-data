Output State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 1, `ans` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `1 << i` and the second element is `k0 - (1 << i)`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`.
- Initially, `ans` contains a single element, which is `1 << i`.
- The `sum(ans)` is therefore `1 << i`.
- The new element appended to `ans` is `k0 - (1 << i)`.
- The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `k`, `k0`, `c`, and `l1`) remain unchanged.
