Output State: **`i` is the second element in `arr`, `arr` must contain at least two elements, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 2. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[1 << i, k0 - sum(ans)]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains a list containing the value `1 << i`.**
