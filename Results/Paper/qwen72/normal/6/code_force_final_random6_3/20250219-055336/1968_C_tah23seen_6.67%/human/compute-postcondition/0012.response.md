Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 500 for all 1 <= i < n, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of length `n` with `ans[0]` equal to `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[1]` equal to `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1 + k * (arr[0] + 1)`, where `k` is the smallest integer such that `ans[1]` is greater than `arr[1]` if `ans[1]` was originally less than `arr[1]`. Otherwise, `ans[1]` remains equal to `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1`. `i` is 0.***
