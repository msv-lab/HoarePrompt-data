### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` containing `n-1` elements.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.

3. **First Element:**
   - The first element of `ans` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `a_2 % a_1 = x_2` because `a_1` is just one more than `x_2`.

4. **Middle Elements:**
   - For each subsequent element `i` from 1 to `n-2`, the program sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it keeps adding `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This ensures that `a_{i+1} % a_i = x_{i+1}`.
   - The annotated state description confirms that `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than `arr[i]` that can be achieved by repeatedly adding `ans[i-1]` to `ans[i]` if `ans[i]` was originally less than `arr[i]`.

5. **Last Element:**
   - The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This ensures that `a_n % a_{n-1} = x_n`.
   - The annotated state description confirms that the last element is correctly set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the First Element:**
  - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` ensures that `a_2 % a_1 = x_2` because `a_1` is just one more than `x_2`.

- **Correctness of Middle Elements:**
  - `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` ensures that `a_{i+1} % a_i = x_{i+1}`.
  - The while loop `while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]: ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` ensures that `a_{i+1}` is always greater than `x_{i+1}` and the condition `a_{i+1} % a_i = x_{i+1}` is maintained.

- **Correctness of the Last Element:**
  - `ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]` ensures that `a_n % a_{n-1} = x_n`.

### Edge Cases:

- **Single Test Case:**
  - The program handles a single test case correctly.

- **Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program correctly processes multiple test cases by decrementing `t` after each test case.

- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - The program handles the boundary conditions for `n` (2 to 500) and the values of `x_i` (1 to 500) as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly generates an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
