The code snippet `ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]` updates the last element of the `ans` list. According to the initial state, `ans[-1]` (which is `ans[n-1]`) is initially the smallest value greater than `arr[n-1]` that can be achieved by repeatedly adding `ans[n-2]` to `ans[n-1]` if `ans[n-1]` was originally less than `arr[n-1]`. Otherwise, `ans[n-1]` is equal to `arr[n-2] + ans[n-2]`.

The code changes `ans[-1]` to be the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`. Therefore, the new value of `ans[-1]` is `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.

The values of `arr`, `n`, and `ans` up to `ans[n-2]` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where \( 1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 500 \) for all \( 1 \leq i < n \), `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \), `ans` is a list of length `n` with `ans[0]` equal to `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than `arr[i]` that can be achieved by repeatedly adding `ans[i-1]` to `ans[i]` if `ans[i]` was originally less than `arr[i]`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is equal to `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`. `ans[n-1]` is equal to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`. `i` is `n-2`.**
