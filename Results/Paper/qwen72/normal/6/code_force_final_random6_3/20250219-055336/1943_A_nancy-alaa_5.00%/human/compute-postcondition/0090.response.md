Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the variables and objects involved:

- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `n` is a variable that must be greater than 1, but its exact value is not provided.
- `first` is a boolean variable set to False.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the list `arr`.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, but its exact values are not provided.

The code snippet to analyze is:
```
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly set to 1, the `print` statement will output the value of `i`.

Output: **1**
