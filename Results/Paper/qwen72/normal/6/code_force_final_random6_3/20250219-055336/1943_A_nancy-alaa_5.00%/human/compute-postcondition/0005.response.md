To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, and `i` will start at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and equal to `t`
- `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user
- `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`
- `first` is False

The only variables that can be adjusted in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Since `n` is already specified to be greater than 0 and equal to `t`, it is already in a state that allows the loop to execute. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the default behavior of `range(n)`.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The loop will run `n` times, with `i` starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 each iteration until it reaches `n-1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and equal to `t`, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False, `i` is 0**
