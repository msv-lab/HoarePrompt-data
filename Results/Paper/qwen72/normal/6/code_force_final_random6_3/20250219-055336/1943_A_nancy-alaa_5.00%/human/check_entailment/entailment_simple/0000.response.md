### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play their game optimally. The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to remove elements from the array `a`, with Alice appending the chosen element to `c`. The goal is to find the MEX of `c` at the end of the game.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Frequency Counting:**
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in `arr`.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program iterates through the range `[0, n-1]` to find the smallest non-negative integer `i` that is not in `arr` or appears exactly once.
   - The variable `first` is used to track whether an integer that appears exactly once has been encountered. This is crucial because if `first` is `True` and `i` appears exactly once, it means Alice can choose this element to maximize the MEX.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the smallest `i` that satisfies the conditions, which is the MEX of `c`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of MEX Calculation:**
  - The MEX is correctly calculated by iterating through the range `[0, n-1]` and checking if each integer is in `mpp` (the frequency counter).
  - If an integer `i` is not in `mpp`, it is the MEX, and the program prints it and breaks the loop.
  - If an integer `i` appears exactly once and `first` is `True`, it means Alice can choose this element to maximize the MEX, and the program prints it and breaks the loop.

- **Optimal Play:**
  - The program assumes that Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice will always try to choose the smallest integer that appears exactly once to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to prevent this by removing the smallest available integer.
  - The logic of setting `first` to `True` when encountering an integer that appears exactly once ensures that Alice can choose this element if it is the smallest available.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles cases where all integers from `0` to `n-1` are present in `arr` by printing `n` if the loop completes without breaking.
  - It also handles cases where no integer appears exactly once by correctly finding the smallest integer not in `arr`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. The use of `Counter` and the loop with the `first` variable ensures that the program follows the optimal strategy for both players.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
