Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and equal to `t`.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
   - `first` is `False`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - If `i` (which is 2) is not in the keys of `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2.
   - The condition "If `i` (which is 2) is not in the keys of `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement" does not affect the `print(i)` statement because it is not part of any loop or if statement in the provided code snippet.
   - Therefore, the value of `i` will be printed as it is.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
