Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `first` is True if `mpp[i]` is 1, otherwise `first` remains False, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
