Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `first` is True.
- `mpp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `i` is a key in the `mpp` Counter object, and the frequency of `i` in `mpp` is 1.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

Given that `i` is explicitly stated to be 0, the `print` statement will output the value of `i`.

Output: **0**
