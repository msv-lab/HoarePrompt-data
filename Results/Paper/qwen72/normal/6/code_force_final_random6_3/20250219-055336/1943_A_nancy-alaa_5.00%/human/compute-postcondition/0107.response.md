Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is the input integer, `first` is True if any integer from `0` to `n-1` appears exactly once in `arr`, otherwise `first` remains False, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `arr` is the list of integers input by the user.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`i` is `n-1`**: The loop variable `i` will have gone through all values from `0` to `n-1` (inclusive), meaning the loop has completed all its iterations.
- **`n` is the input integer**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the input integer that determines the number of iterations.
- **`first` is True if any integer from `0` to `n-1` appears exactly once in `arr`**: The variable `first` will be set to `True` if, during the loop, any integer `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) appears exactly once in the list `arr`. If no such integer exists, `first` remains `False`.
- **`mpp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`**: The `Counter` object `mpp` remains unchanged, still containing the frequency of each integer in the list `arr`.
- **`arr` is the list of integers input by the user**: The list `arr` remains unchanged, as the loop does not modify it.
