Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and equal to `t`.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
   - `first` is False.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.
   - The print statement `print(i)` will simply print the value of `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `i` is 1, the print statement will output 1.

Output: **1**
