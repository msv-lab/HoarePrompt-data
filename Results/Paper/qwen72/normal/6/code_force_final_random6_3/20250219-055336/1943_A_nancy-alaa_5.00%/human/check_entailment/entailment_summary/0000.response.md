### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the array `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - If an integer appears exactly once in `a`, Alice will pick it on her first turn to ensure it is in `c`.
   - If an integer appears more than once, Bob will pick it to prevent Alice from picking it and increasing the MEX.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
   - It iterates through the range `[0, n-1]` to find the first integer that either:
     - Does not appear in `arr` (i.e., `i not in mpp.keys()`).
     - Appears exactly once in `arr` and `first` is `True` (i.e., `mpp[i] == 1 and first`).
   - The variable `first` is used to track if any integer from `0` to `n-1` has appeared exactly once in `arr`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the first integer that is not in `arr` or the first integer that appears exactly once after a previous integer has appeared exactly once.
   - This logic aligns with the optimal strategy for both players:
     - Alice will pick the smallest integer that appears exactly once on her first turn.
     - Bob will pick the smallest integer that appears more than once to prevent Alice from picking it.
     - If no such integer is found, the program prints the last integer checked, which is the correct MEX for the given array.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `arr` contains all integers from `0` to `n-1` by printing `n` (since `n` is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array).
   - The program also handles the case where `arr` contains no integers by printing `0`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob and computes the MEX of the array `c` as required by the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
