Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and equal to `t`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
- `first` is `False`.
- `i` is 1.
- If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1.
2. **Condition Check**: The condition states that if `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. However, this condition does not affect the value of `i` before the `print` statement is executed.
3. **Output**: The `print` statement will simply print the value of `i`, which is 1.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
