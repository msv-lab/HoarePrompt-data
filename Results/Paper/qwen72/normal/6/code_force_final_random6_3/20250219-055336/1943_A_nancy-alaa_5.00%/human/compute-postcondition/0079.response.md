Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `first` is False.
- `mpp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `i` is not a key in the `mpp` Counter object.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly given as 0 in the initial state, the `print` statement will output the value of `i`.

Output: **0**
