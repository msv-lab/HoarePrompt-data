Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem by calculating the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons based on the given constraints. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Space Calculation**: For each test case, it calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x`) and the 2x2 icons (`space_y`).
3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**: It determines the number of screens required to place all the 2x2 icons. If the number of 2x2 icons `y` is even, it divides `y` by 2. If `y` is odd, it divides `y` by 2 and adds 1 to account for the extra screen needed.
4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**: It calculates the remaining cells available on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
5. **Check for 1x1 Icons**: It checks if the remaining cells are sufficient to place all the 1x1 icons. If so, it appends the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons to the result list.
6. **Extra Screens for 1x1 Icons**: If the remaining cells are not sufficient, it calculates the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons and adds this to the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons.
7. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The logic and calculations are correct and align with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
