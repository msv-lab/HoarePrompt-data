### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case by reading the values of `x` and `y`. This is accurate and matches the problem description.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x`) and the 2x2 icons (`space_y`). This is done correctly as `space_x = x * 1` and `space_y = y * 4`.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program determines the number of screens required to fit all the 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. The program calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons as follows:
     - If `y` is even, it divides `y` by 2 to get the number of screens required (`y // 2`).
     - If `y` is odd, it divides `y` by 2 and adds 1 to ensure all 2x2 icons fit (`y // 2 + 1`).
   - This logic is correct because each screen can fit at most 3 of the 2x2 icons (12 cells), and the program correctly handles both even and odd numbers of 2x2 icons.

4. **Remaining Space Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons using the formula `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - This is correct because it subtracts the space occupied by the 2x2 icons from the total available space on the screens.

5. **Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining space is not sufficient to fit all the 1x1 icons (`space_x > remaining_cells`), the program calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the remaining space is not a multiple of 15 by adding 1 to the quotient of `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`.
   - This ensures that all 1x1 icons are placed, even if they don't completely fill the last screen.

6. **Output:**
   - The program appends the total number of screens required to the `result` list and prints the results for all test cases at the end. This is done correctly using `print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the case where `x` and `y` are both zero, correctly outputting 0 screens.
- The program also handles the case where only 1x1 icons are present, correctly calculating the number of screens needed based on the total number of 1x1 icons.
- The program correctly handles the case where only 2x2 icons are present, ensuring that the minimum number of screens is used.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and the main logic is sound. The annotations confirm that the program's state and calculations are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
