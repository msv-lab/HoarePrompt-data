You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, x and y, where x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        space_x = x * 1
        
        space_y = y * 4
        
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if extra_space % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    #State: `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `n` is 0, `result` is a list containing the number of screens required for each pair of `x` and `y` values entered. For each pair, if `y` is even, the number of screens required is `y // 2`. If `y` is odd, the number of screens required is `y // 2 + 1`. If `space_x` (which is `x * 1`) is less than or equal to the remaining cells (calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`), then the number of screens required for that pair is `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, the number of screens required is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `x * 1 - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)`, and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0`, or `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: [number of screens required for each pair of x and y values, each on a new line]
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, both of which are integers between 0 and 99, inclusive.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
