Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - (y * 4)`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing the value `y // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing a single element which is `extra_screen + y // 2 + 1`, where `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15` is 0, otherwise `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`.**
