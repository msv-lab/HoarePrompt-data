To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step.

### Initial State:
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user.
- `n` is 0 (though it is not used in the given code snippet).
- `result` is a list that will store the number of screens required for each pair of `x` and `y` values entered.
- The number of screens required for each pair is determined by the following rules:
  - If `y` is even, the number of screens required is `y // 2`.
  - If `y` is odd, the number of screens required is `y // 2 + 1`.
  - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1`.
  - The remaining cells are calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`.
  - If `space_x` is less than or equal to the remaining cells, then the number of screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
  - Otherwise, the number of screens required is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where:
    - `extra_space` is `x * 1 - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)`.
    - `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0`, or `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement will print each element of the `result` list, each on a new line.
- The elements of `result` are the number of screens required for each pair of `x` and `y` values entered, calculated according to the rules described in the initial state.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `result`. However, we can describe the output based on the rules given:

- For each pair of `x` and `y`:
  - If `y` is even, the number of screens required is `y // 2`.
  - If `y` is odd, the number of screens required is `y // 2 + 1`.
  - If `x` fits within the remaining cells, the number of screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
  - If `x` does not fit within the remaining cells, the number of screens required is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.

Therefore, the output will be a series of numbers, each representing the number of screens required for the corresponding pair of `x` and `y` values entered.

Output: **[number of screens required for each pair of x and y values, each on a new line]**

For example, if the user entered the pairs `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, and `(x3, y3)`, the output might look like:
```
number_of_screens_for_x1_y1
number_of_screens_for_x2_y2
number_of_screens_for_x3_y3
```

Where each `number_of_screens_for_xi_yi` is the number of screens required for the pair `(xi, yi)` based on the rules described.
