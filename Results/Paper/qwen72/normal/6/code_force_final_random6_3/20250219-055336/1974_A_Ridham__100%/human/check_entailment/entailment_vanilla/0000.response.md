### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case by reading the values of `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x`) and the 2x2 icons (`space_y`).
   - It then calculates the total space required (`total_space`) by summing `space_x` and `space_y`.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program determines the number of screens required to fit all the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
   - If the number of 2x2 icons `y` is even, it divides `y` by 2 to get the number of screens required.
   - If `y` is odd, it divides `y` by 2 and adds 1 to ensure all 2x2 icons fit.

4. **Remaining Space Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - It then checks if the remaining space is sufficient to fit all the 1x1 icons (`space_x`).

5. **Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining space is not sufficient, it calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the remaining space is not a multiple of 15 by adding 1 to the quotient of `extra_space // 15`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program appends the total number of screens required to the `result` list and prints the results for all test cases at the end.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is correct. Each screen can fit at most 3 of the 2x2 icons (since 3 * 4 = 12 cells), and the program correctly handles both even and odd numbers of 2x2 icons.
- The logic for calculating the remaining space and the additional screens required for 1x1 icons is also correct. The program ensures that all 1x1 icons fit by calculating the extra space needed and the additional screens required.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the case where `x` and `y` are both zero, correctly outputting 0 screens.
- The program also handles the case where only 1x1 icons are present, correctly calculating the number of screens needed based on the total number of 1x1 icons.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and the main logic is sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
