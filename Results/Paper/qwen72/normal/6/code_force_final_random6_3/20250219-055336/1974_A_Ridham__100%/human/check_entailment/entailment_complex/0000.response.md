### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times to read each pair of `(x, y)` values.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the total space required for `1x1` icons (`space_x = x * 1`) and `2x2` icons (`space_y = y * 4`).

3. **Screen Calculation for `2x2` Icons:**
   - The function correctly calculates the number of screens required for the `2x2` icons. If `y` is even, it uses `y // 2` screens. If `y` is odd, it uses `y // 2 + 1` screens. This is correct because each `2x2` icon occupies 4 cells, and a screen has 15 cells, so two `2x2` icons can fit in one screen.

4. **Remaining Space Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the remaining space on the screens allocated for `2x2` icons as `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. This is correct because `15 * screen_require_for_y` gives the total number of cells available on the screens, and `space_y` is the total space occupied by the `2x2` icons.

5. **Checking if `1x1` Icons Fit:**
   - If the space occupied by `1x1` icons (`space_x`) is less than or equal to the remaining cells (`remaining_cells`), the function correctly appends `screen_require_for_y` to the result list. This means that all `1x1` icons can fit into the remaining space on the screens allocated for `2x2` icons.

6. **Calculating Additional Screens for `1x1` Icons:**
   - If `space_x` exceeds `remaining_cells`, the function calculates the additional screens required for the remaining `1x1` icons. The calculation `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells` and `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + (1 if extra_space % 15 != 0 else 0)` is correct. This ensures that the remaining `1x1` icons are placed on the minimum number of additional screens.

7. **Output:**
   - The function correctly prints the number of screens required for each test case, each on a new line.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It calculates the minimum number of screens required for each pair of `(x, y)` values and prints the results in the expected format.

**Correctness: **True****
