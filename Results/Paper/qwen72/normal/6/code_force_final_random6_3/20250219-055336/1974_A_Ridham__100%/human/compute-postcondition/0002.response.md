The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a dummy variable used to indicate that the loop index is not used within the loop body, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` must be greater than 0; `result` is an empty list**
