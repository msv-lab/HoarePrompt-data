Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `_` is 0, `s` is 1 + 1 // (k - 1), `i` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated to `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`. Initially, `s` is 1. The expression `s // (k - 1)` is the integer division of 1 by `(k - 1)`, which will be 0 for any valid value of `k` (since 2 <= k <= 30). Therefore, `s` becomes `1 + 0 + 1`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
