Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `_` is 0, and the input must be a positive integer greater than 0.** 

The code snippet `k, x, a = map(int, input().split())` reads a single line of input, splits it into three parts, and assigns the integer values to `k`, `x`, and `a` respectively. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are updated based on the input, and the initial state of `t` and `_` remains unchanged. The input must still be a positive integer greater than 0.
