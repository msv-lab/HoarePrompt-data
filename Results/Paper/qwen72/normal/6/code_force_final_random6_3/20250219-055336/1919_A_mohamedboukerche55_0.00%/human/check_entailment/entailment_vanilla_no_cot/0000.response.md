Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input for each test case but does not process it correctly. The `input()` function is called inside the loop, but the values of `a` and `b` are only used after the loop ends, which means only the last test case is processed.

2. **Logic Error**: The program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd to determine the winner. However, this is not the correct logic for the game. The game is about the number of moves each player can make, and the parity of the sum of coins does not directly determine the winner.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints "bob" with an extra space, which is incorrect according to the problem's output format. It should print "Bob" without any extra spaces.

### Correct Solution:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to determine the number of moves each player can make. The key observation is that the player with more coins will always be able to force a win if the difference in the number of coins is at least 2. If the difference is exactly 1, the player with fewer coins will win because the player with more coins will eventually be forced to swap and then lose.

Here is the correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif (a - b) % 2 == 0:
            if a > b:
                print('Alice')
            else:
                print('Bob')
        else:
            if a > b:
                print('Bob')
            else:
                print('Alice')

func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case inside the loop.
- **Winning Condition**:
  - If `a == b`, Bob wins because Alice will be forced to make the first move and eventually run out of coins.
  - If the difference `(a - b)` is even, the player with more coins will win because they can always force the other player to make a move that results in a win.
  - If the difference `(a - b)` is odd, the player with fewer coins will win because the player with more coins will eventually be forced to swap and then lose.

This solution correctly handles the game logic and outputs the results in the required format.
