Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it processes multiple test cases. The loop that reads the test cases does not print the result for each test case immediately after processing it. Instead, it processes all test cases and only prints the result for the last test case, based on the final values of `a` and `b`. This means that the program will not produce the correct output for each test case as required by the problem statement.

Additionally, the program prints the names with an extra space at the end, which is not specified in the problem description and could be considered incorrect if the output format is strictly enforced.

To fix these issues, the program should print the result for each test case immediately after processing it, and it should ensure that the output format matches the problem description exactly.

Correctness: **False**
