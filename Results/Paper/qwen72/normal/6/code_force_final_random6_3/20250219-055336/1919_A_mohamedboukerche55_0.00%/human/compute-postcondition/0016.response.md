Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is calculated as `int(input()) - 1`. This means `i` is the result of subtracting 1 from the integer input provided by the user.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations. This implies that the user input for `int(input())` is a valid integer and is at least as large as the number of iterations.
   - `s` is the last user input string. This means `s` is the string that the user most recently entered.
   - `a` is the first integer from the last user input string `s`.
   - `b` is the second integer from the last user input string `s`.
   - The sum of `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2. This means that `a + b` is an odd number.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('alice')
   ```

The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'alice'`. The values of `i`, `s`, `a`, and `b` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **alice**
