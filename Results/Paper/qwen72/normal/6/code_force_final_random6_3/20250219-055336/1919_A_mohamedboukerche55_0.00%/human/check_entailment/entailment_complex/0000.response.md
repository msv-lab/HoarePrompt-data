### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads a line of input and splits it into two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Logic**:
   - The function checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the condition `((a + b) % 2 == 0)`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints `'bob  '`.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `'alice'`.

3. **Optimal Play Analysis**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to either swap wallets or remove a coin.
   - The key insight is that the game is symmetric and the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins (`a + b`) determines the winner.
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally. This is because Alice will always be the one to make the last move that results in an even number of coins, and Bob can always force Alice to make a move that results in an odd number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally. This is because Alice can always force Bob to make a move that results in an even number of coins, and she will be the one to make the last move.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the correct winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

5. **Issues**:
   - The function only processes the last test case because the `if` and `else` statements are outside the loop. This means that only the last test case's result is printed, and all previous test cases are ignored.
   - The output format for Bob is incorrect. It should be `'Bob'` instead of `'bob  '`.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
- The function is incorrect because it only processes the last test case and ignores all previous test cases.
- The output format for Bob is incorrect. It should be `'Bob'` instead of `'bob  '`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(s.split()[0])
        b = int(s.split()[1])
        
        if ((a + b) % 2 == 0):
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This corrected program will correctly process each test case and print the correct winner in the correct format.
