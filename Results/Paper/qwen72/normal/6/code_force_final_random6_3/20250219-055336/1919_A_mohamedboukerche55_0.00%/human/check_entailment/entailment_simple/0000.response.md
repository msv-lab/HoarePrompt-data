### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads a line of input `s` and splits it into two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the condition `((a + b) % 2 == 0)`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints `'bob  '`.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `'alice'`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The problem states that both players play optimally. The key to solving this problem is understanding the parity (even or odd nature) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins is even, the game will always end in a situation where both players have an equal number of turns, and the last player to make a move will be the one who loses. Since Alice starts, Bob will win if the total number of coins is even.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will have one more turn than Bob, and she will be the last player to make a move, thus winning the game.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, but it includes an extra space in the string `'bob  '`. This is incorrect according to the problem description, which requires the output to be exactly "Bob" or "Alice" without any extra spaces.

### Conclusion:
- The logic for determining the winner is correct, but the output format is incorrect due to the extra space in the string `'bob  '`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program is logically correct but fails to meet the output format requirements specified in the problem description.
