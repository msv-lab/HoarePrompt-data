You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        
        n = int(input())
        
        l = input()
        
        lst = l.split(' ')
        
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `i` is `t - 1` (which is -1), `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements from each test case, `n` is the last input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the last input string, and `lst` is the last list of substrings obtained by splitting the last `l` using spaces as the delimiter. If the length of `lst` was initially greater than or equal to 2, `lst` will have all but the last two elements removed, and `ans` will be the sum of the minimum values of the pairs of elements removed. If the length of `lst` was exactly 2, `ans` will be the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers, and the loop will have exited after the first iteration.
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `i` has iterated through all elements of `ans_f`, `ans_f` contains all the elements it had initially, `n` is the last input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the last input string, `lst` is the last list of substrings obtained by splitting the last `l` using spaces as the delimiter, and `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of the pairs of elements removed if the length of `lst` was initially greater than or equal to 2, or the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers if the length of `lst` was exactly 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a space-separated string of 2n integers. It then processes these integers in pairs, summing the minimum value of each pair, and appends the result to a list `ans_f`. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element in `ans_f`, which contains the sum of the minimum values of pairs for each test case. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Reading the List of Integers**: For each test case, the program reads the integer `n` and the list of 2n integers. The list is read as a string and split into a list of strings, which is then processed.

3. **Processing the List**: The program attempts to process the list of integers by repeatedly selecting the first two elements, computing the minimum of these two elements, and adding it to the score. However, there are several issues with this approach:
   - The program uses `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` to remove elements from the list. This is incorrect because `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` are always 0 and 2, respectively, which do not correspond to the indices of the elements being removed.
   - The program does not sort the list, which is necessary to ensure that the minimum values are always selected in pairs to maximize the score.

4. **Correct Approach**: To maximize the score, the optimal strategy is to sort the list of integers and then pair the smallest elements together. This ensures that the minimum values are always added to the score, which maximizes the total score.

5. **Correctness of the Logic**: The current logic in the program does not follow the optimal strategy and will not produce the correct maximum score for all test cases.

6. **Output**: The program correctly appends the computed score to a list `ans_f` and prints the results for each test case at the end.

Given the issues with the element removal and the lack of sorting, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
