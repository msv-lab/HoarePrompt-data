Output State: **`t` is greater than `n * 2`, `i` is 0, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter, and the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
