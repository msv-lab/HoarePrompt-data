The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the first element of the list `lst`. 

Let's break down the impact on the program and the variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is a new input integer greater than or equal to 2
   - `t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`
   - `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (now with an additional element)
   - `l` is a new input string
   - `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter
   - `ans` is the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first and third elements of `lst` have been removed, and `ans` remains 0.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` simplifies to `lst.remove(lst[0])`, which removes the first element of `lst`.

3. **Output State:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is a new input integer greater than or equal to 2
   - `t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`
   - `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (now with an additional element)
   - `l` is a new input string
   - `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter, but the first element has been removed.
   - `ans` is the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first and third elements of `lst` have been removed, and `ans` remains 0.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (now with an additional element), `l` is a new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter, but the first element has been removed, `ans` is the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first and third elements of `lst` have been removed, and `ans` remains 0.**
