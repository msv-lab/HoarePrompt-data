Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces as the delimiter, and the length of `lst` is not 2.** 

The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the integers represented by the first and second elements of `lst`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
