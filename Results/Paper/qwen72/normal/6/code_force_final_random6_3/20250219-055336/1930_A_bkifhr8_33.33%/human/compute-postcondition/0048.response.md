Output State: **`t` is greater than `n * 2`, `i` is 1, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter, `ans` is updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `lst` has the first element removed if the length of `lst` was exactly 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if the length of `lst` was exactly 2.**
