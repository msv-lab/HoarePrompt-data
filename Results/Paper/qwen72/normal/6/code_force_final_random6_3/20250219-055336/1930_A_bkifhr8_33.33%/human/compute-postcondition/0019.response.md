The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 (since `1 * 2` equals 2) from the list `lst`.

Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `ans_f` is an empty list
- `n` is greater than 0
- `l` is an input string
- `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces as the delimiter
- The first, second, and third elements of `lst` have been removed
- `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[1])` and `int(lst[2])` before the third element was removed

After the code is executed:
- The element at index 2 of `lst` is removed
- The length of `lst` is reduced by 1

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces as the delimiter, the first, second, and third elements of `lst` have been removed, and now the element at index 2 has also been removed, `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[1])` and `int(lst[2])` before the third element was removed.**
