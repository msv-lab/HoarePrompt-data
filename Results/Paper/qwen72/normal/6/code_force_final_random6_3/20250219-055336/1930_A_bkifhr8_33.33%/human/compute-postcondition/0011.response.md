Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces as the delimiter, and the length of `lst` is not 2. The first element of `lst` has been removed, and the second element of `lst` has also been removed.**

Explanation:
- The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` simplifies to `lst.remove(lst[2])`, which removes the third element of `lst`.
- Since the first element of `lst` has already been removed, the list `lst` now has at least two elements before the code is executed.
- After executing the code, the third element (which is now the second element after the first removal) is removed.
- The other variables (`t`, `i`, `ans_f`, `ans`, `n`, and `l`) are not affected by this code, so their initial states remain unchanged.
