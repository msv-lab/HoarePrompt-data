To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n * 2`.

1. **`i`**: The loop variable `i` should start at 0, as it is the initial value for the `range` function in a for loop.
2. **`n * 2`**: The loop will execute if `n * 2` is greater than 0. Since `n` is a new input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given these adjustments, the state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`t` is greater than `n * 2`, `i` is 0, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (which is 0), `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter.**
