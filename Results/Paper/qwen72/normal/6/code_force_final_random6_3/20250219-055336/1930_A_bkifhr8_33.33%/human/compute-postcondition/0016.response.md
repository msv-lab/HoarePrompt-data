The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n * 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain such that `n * 2` is greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is an input string, and `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces as the delimiter. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and the first and second elements of `lst` have been removed. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the minimum of the integer values of the two substrings in `lst`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
