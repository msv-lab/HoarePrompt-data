Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the third tuple and must have at least `len(arr)` elements, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the value of `count` has been appended to it, `count` is now the sum of all values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each `num` in `arr`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary where each key is the result of `num % x` for each `num` in `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that key appears, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is the result of `num % y` for each `num` in `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that key appears, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is the result of `num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is the result of `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations:
- The `test_cases` list remains unchanged and must have at least three tuples.
- The `n`, `x`, and `y` values are unchanged and are the first, second, and third elements of the third tuple in `test_cases`, respectively.
- The `arr` list remains unchanged and must have at least as many elements as its length.
- The `results` list now contains the final value of `count` and this value has been appended to it.
- The `count` variable is the sum of all values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each `num` in `arr`.
- The `mod_x_map` dictionary contains keys that are the results of `num % x` for each `num` in `arr`, and the values are the counts of how many times each key appears.
- The `mod_y_map` dictionary contains keys that are the results of `num % y` for each `num` in `arr`, and the values are the counts of how many times each key appears.
- The `num` variable is the last element of `arr`.
- The `mod_x` variable is the result of `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`.
- The `mod_y` variable is the result of `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.
- The `mod_x_key` variable is the result of `num % x` for the last element of `arr`.
- The `mod_y_key` variable is the result of `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.
