Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the third tuple and must have at least 3 elements, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the value of `count` has been appended to it, `count` is now `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + (mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)) + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with the key `mod_x_key` and value 2, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with the key `mod_y_key` and value 2, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the result of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is the result of `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code `count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` increments the value of `count` by the sum of the values found in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` using `mod_x` and `mod_y` as keys, respectively.
- Given that `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` both have a value of 2 for their respective keys, the increment to `count` is `2 + 2 = 4`.
- Therefore, the new value of `count` is the original value of `count` plus 4.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
