Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the second tuple and must have at least one element, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` as a key and the value 1, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` as a key and the value 1, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the result of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is the result of `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the `mod_y_map` dictionary by adding 1 to the value associated with the key `mod_y_key`. If `mod_y_key` does not exist in `mod_y_map`, it initializes the key with the value 1.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
