Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array for multiple test cases. A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program reads the input, processes each test case, and then calls `func_1` to compute the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. Let's analyze the function `func_1` in detail:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, `count` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.

2. **Modulo Maps**:
   - `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are dictionaries that store the counts of elements based on their remainders when divided by \(x\) and \(y\), respectively.

3. **Iterating through the Array**:
   - For each element `num` in the array `arr`, the program calculates:
     - `mod_x = -num % x`: This is intended to find the remainder when \(-num\) is divided by \(x\).
     - `mod_y = num % y`: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by \(y\).
   - The program then increments `count` by the sum of the counts of elements that have the same remainders as `mod_x` and `mod_y` in the respective dictionaries.
   - The program updates the dictionaries with the current element's remainders:
     - `mod_x_key = num % x`: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by \(x\).
     - `mod_y_key = num % y`: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by \(y\).

4. **Final Output**:
   - After processing all elements in the array, the `count` for the current test case is appended to `results`.
   - The function returns `results`, which contains the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:
- The program incorrectly counts pairs based on the remainders of individual elements rather than pairs of elements. Specifically, the condition \(a_i + a_j\) being divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) being divisible by \(y\) should be checked for all pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) where \(1 \le i < j \le n\).

The current implementation does not correctly check pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\). Instead, it increments `count` based on the individual elements' remainders, which does not ensure that the pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) satisfy both conditions.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Iterate through all pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) where \(1 \le i < j \le n\).
2. Check if both conditions \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) and \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) are satisfied.
3. Increment `count` for each pair that satisfies both conditions.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly count the beautiful pairs as defined in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
