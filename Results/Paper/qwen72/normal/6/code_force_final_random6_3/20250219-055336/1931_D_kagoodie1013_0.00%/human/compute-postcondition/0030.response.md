The value of `count` is appended to the list `results`. The `results` list, which was initially empty, now contains one element, which is the value of `count`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the first tuple and must have at least `len(arr)` elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is the sum of all values in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for each `num` in `arr` except the first occurrence of each unique `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `num % x` from `arr` and its value is the count of occurrences of that key in `arr`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `num % y` from `arr` and its value is the count of occurrences of that key in `arr`.**
