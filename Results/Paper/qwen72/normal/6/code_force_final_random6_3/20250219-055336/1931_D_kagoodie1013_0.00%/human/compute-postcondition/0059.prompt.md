Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the second tuple and must have at least `len(arr)` elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is now 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is now an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in arr:
    mod_x = -num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
    mod_x_key = num % x
    mod_y_key = num % y
    mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
    mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the second tuple and must have at least one element, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` as a key and the value 1, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` as a key and the value 1, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the result of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is the result of `num % y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the second tuple and must have at least two elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is updated to `count + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` as a key and the value 2, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` as a key and the value 2, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the result of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is the result of `num % y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the second tuple and must have at least three elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is updated to `count + mod_x_map.get(-num % x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(num % y, 0)`, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the result of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is the result of `num % y`, `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` is incremented by 1, `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
