Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the first tuple and must have at least `len(arr)` elements, `results` is an empty list, `count` is the sum of all values in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for each `num` in `arr` except the first occurrence of each unique `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `num % x` from `arr` and its value is the count of occurrences of that key in `arr`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `num % y` from `arr` and its value is the count of occurrences of that key in `arr`.**

### Explanation:
- **`test_cases`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`n`, `x`, `y`**: These variables are not modified by the loop, so they remain unchanged.
- **`arr`**: The loop iterates over each element in `arr`, so `arr` must have at least `len(arr)` elements.
- **`results`**: This list remains empty as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`count`**: This variable accumulates the sum of the values in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for each `num` in `arr`, except for the first occurrence of each unique `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key`.
- **`mod_x_map`**: This dictionary keeps track of the frequency of each unique value of `num % x` in `arr`.
- **`mod_y_map`**: This dictionary keeps track of the frequency of each unique value of `num % y` in `arr`.
