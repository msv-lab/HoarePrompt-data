Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the first tuple and must have at least one element, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mod_y = num % y` calculates the remainder of `num` divided by `y` and assigns it to `mod_y`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged. The value of `mod_y` is now the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
