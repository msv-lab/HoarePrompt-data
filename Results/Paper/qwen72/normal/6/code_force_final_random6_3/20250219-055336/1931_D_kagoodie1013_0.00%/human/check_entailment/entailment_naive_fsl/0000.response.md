Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly count the number of beautiful pairs as described in the problem. The logic for counting pairs is flawed. Specifically, the program is incrementing the count based on the current number's mod values, which does not ensure that both conditions for a beautiful pair (i.e., \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\)) are met simultaneously.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 3 2
1 2 4 5
```
The expected output is 1, as the only beautiful pair is \(\langle 1, 4 \rangle\):
- \(a_1 + a_4 = 1 + 5 = 6\) (6 is divisible by 3)
- \(a_1 - a_4 = 1 - 5 = -4\) (-4 is divisible by 2)

However, the program will output 2, because it incorrectly counts pairs based on the mod values without ensuring both conditions are met simultaneously.
