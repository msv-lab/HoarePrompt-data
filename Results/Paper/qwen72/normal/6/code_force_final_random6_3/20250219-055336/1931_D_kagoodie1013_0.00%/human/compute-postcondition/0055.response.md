Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the second tuple and must have at least three elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is updated to `count + mod_x_map.get(-num % x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(num % y, 0)`, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the result of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is the result of `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `mod_x_key = num % x` updates the value of `mod_x_key` to the result of `num % x`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
- `mod_x_key` is now equal to `num % x`, which is the same as `mod_y_key` according to the initial state.
- `mod_y_key` remains the same as it was initially, which is `num % y`.
