Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the first tuple and must have at least 2 elements, `results` is an empty list, `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` as a key and 1 as its value, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` as a key and 1 as its value, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `mod_y = num % y` updates the value of `mod_y` to be the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- The initial state specifies that `num` is the second element of `arr`, and `y` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`.
- The value of `mod_y` is now specifically `num % y`.
- The value of `mod_x` remains `-num % x`.
- The values of `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` remain `num % x` and `num % y` respectively.
- The `count` variable is still calculated as `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, but the value of `mod_y` has been updated.
