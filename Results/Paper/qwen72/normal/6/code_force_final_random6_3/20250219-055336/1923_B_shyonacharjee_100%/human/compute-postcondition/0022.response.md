Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element from the pairs formed by zipping `x` and `a` that must have at least 2 tuples, `bullets_used` is equal to the sum of the health of the first and second monsters, `pos` is the first element of the second tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the second tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the health of the first and second monsters, `can_survive` is True if `total_bullets_needed` is not greater than `distance * k`, otherwise `can_survive` is False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
