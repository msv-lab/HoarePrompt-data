You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to handle the input as described. A correct function definition would be:
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        
        bullets_used = 0
        
        can_survive = True
        
        for pos, health in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element from the pairs formed by zipping `x` and `a`, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all the tuples in the `monsters` list that were processed before the loop broke or finished, `can_survive` is True if the total bullets used (`bullets_used`) is less than or equal to the product of the absolute value of the position (`distance`) and `k` for all tuples in the `monsters` list, otherwise `can_survive` is False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from user input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `x`. It then processes these inputs to determine if it is possible to survive by checking if the total number of bullets needed to defeat all monsters (sum of health values in `a`) is less than or equal to the product of the maximum distance (absolute value of positions in `x`) and `k`. The function prints 'YES' if it is possible to survive and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function ends.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n` and the number of bullets you can fire per second `k`.
   - It then reads the health values `a` and the positions `x` of the monsters.

2. **Monster Sorting:**
   - The program sorts the monsters based on their distance from the character (i.e., `abs(pos)`). This is a crucial step because you want to prioritize killing the monsters that are closest to you first.

3. **Bullet Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `bullets_used` to 0 and `can_survive` to True.
   - It iterates through the sorted list of monsters.
   - For each monster, it calculates the `distance` from the character.
   - It calculates the `total_bullets_needed` to kill the current monster, which is the sum of the bullets already used and the health of the current monster.
   - It checks if the `total_bullets_needed` exceeds the product of `distance` and `k`. If it does, the character cannot survive because the monster will reach the character before it can be killed.
   - If the character can survive, it adds the health of the current monster to `bullets_used`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all monsters for a test case, the program prints 'YES' if `can_survive` is True, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output formats.
- The sorting step ensures that the closest monsters are targeted first, which is a valid strategy to maximize the chances of survival.
- The bullet calculation and the condition to check if the character can survive are logically sound. The condition `total_bullets_needed > distance * k` ensures that the character has enough time to kill the monster before it reaches the character.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
