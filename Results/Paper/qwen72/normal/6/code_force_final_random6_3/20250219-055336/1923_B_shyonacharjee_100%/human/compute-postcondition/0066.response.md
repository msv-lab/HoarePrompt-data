Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element from the pairs formed by zipping `x` and `a`, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all the monsters that were processed before the loop either completed or broke, `can_survive` is True if the total bullets used did not exceed the total distance threshold (`distance * k`) for any monster, otherwise `can_survive` is False.**

The code snippet `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `x` to a new list of integers provided by the user. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
