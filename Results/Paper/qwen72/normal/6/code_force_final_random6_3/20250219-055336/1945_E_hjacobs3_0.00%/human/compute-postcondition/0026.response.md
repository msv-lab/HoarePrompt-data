Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `array` of integers representing a permutation of size `n` and an integer `find` within the range 1 to `n`. It performs a binary search to find the smallest index `l` such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`. If `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`, it prints `1` and returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the value of `l + 1` converted to a string, and the second string is the index of `find` in `array` plus 1, also converted to a string. If `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`, it prints `0` and does not return anything. **
