### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search loop condition in `func_1` is `l <= r`, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, the loop should end when `r - l = 1`, which translates to `l < r` in the loop condition.
   - The binary search logic is also flawed. The problem description specifies that if `p_m <= x`, then `l = m`, otherwise `r = m`. However, the program uses `array[mid] >= find` to update `r = mid - 1` and `l = mid + 1`, which is not consistent with the problem description. This can lead to incorrect results, especially when the array is not sorted.

2. **Swap Logic**:
   - The program always prints `1` and attempts to swap the elements, even if the number `x` is already in the correct position. This is unnecessary and incorrect.
   - The program does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed to place `x` in the correct position. The problem description guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, but the program does not implement this logic.

### Example Case Analysis:
- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  6 3
  1 2 3 4 5 6
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  0
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  ```
  1
  3 3
  ```
- **Explanation**: The number `3` is already in the correct position, so no swaps are needed. However, the program incorrectly prints `1` and attempts to swap `3` with itself, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

### Corrected Program:
To correct the program, we need to:
1. Fix the binary search loop condition to `l < r`.
2. Correct the binary search logic to match the problem description.
3. Implement the swap logic to handle cases where more than one swap is needed and ensure that no unnecessary swaps are performed.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(len(res))
        for swap in res:
            print(' '.join(map(str, swap)))
    else:
        print(0)
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while l < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid
    correct_index = array.index(find)
    if l - 1 == correct_index:
        return None
    else:
        swaps = []
        if l - 1 != correct_index:
            swaps.append([l, correct_index + 1])
            array[l - 1], array[correct_index] = array[correct_index], array[l - 1]
            if l - 1 != correct_index:
                # Perform a second swap if needed
                for i in range(n):
                    if array[i] != i + 1:
                        for j in range(i + 1, n):
                            if array[j] == i + 1:
                                swaps.append([i + 1, j + 1])
                                array[i], array[j] = array[j], array[i]
                                break
                        break
        return swaps
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case, and the binary search and swap logic are flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
