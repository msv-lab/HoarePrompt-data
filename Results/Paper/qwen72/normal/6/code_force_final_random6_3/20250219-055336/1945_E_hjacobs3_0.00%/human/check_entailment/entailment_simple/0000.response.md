Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding a number \( x \) in a permutation \( p \) of size \( n \) using a modified binary search algorithm. The key points to consider are:

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in the function `func_1` is slightly incorrect. The standard binary search algorithm should adjust the search range based on whether the middle element is less than or greater than the target. However, in this program, the condition `array[mid] >= find` is used to adjust the right boundary, which is not the correct condition for a permutation. The correct condition should be `array[mid] == find` to stop the search when the target is found, and `array[mid] < find` to move the left boundary, and `array[mid] > find` to move the right boundary.

2. **Swapping Elements**: The program aims to swap elements to ensure that the binary search will find the correct element. The function `func_1` checks if the index \( l \) (where the search ends) is not equal to the index of \( x \) in the array. If they are not equal, it prints 1 and returns the indices to swap. If they are equal, it prints 0, indicating no swaps are needed.

3. **Output Format**: The output format is correct. It prints the number of swaps and the indices to swap, as required by the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases correctly. If the element \( x \) is already at the correct position, it prints 0 and returns without any swaps. If the element \( x \) is not at the correct position, it prints 1 and returns the indices to swap.

5. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition `while l <= r` is incorrect for the binary search algorithm. It should be `while r - l > 1` to match the problem description, which states that the loop should end when \( r - l = 1 \).

6. **Index Off-by-One**: The indices returned by the function are \( l + 1 \) and `array.index(find) + 1`, which is correct since the problem uses 1-based indexing.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because the binary search logic is flawed. The condition `array[mid] >= find` will not correctly narrow down the search range for a permutation, and the loop condition `while l <= r` will not terminate the loop as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
