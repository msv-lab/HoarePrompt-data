Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is (`l` + `r`) // 2, `l` is `mid` + 1, `r` is `mid` - 2, and `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.** 

The value of `r` has been updated to `mid` - 2, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
