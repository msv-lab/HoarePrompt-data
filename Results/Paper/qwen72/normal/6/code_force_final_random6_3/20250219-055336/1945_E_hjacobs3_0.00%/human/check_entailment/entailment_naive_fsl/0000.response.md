Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case. Specifically, the binary search implementation and the swap logic are flawed.

1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search loop condition should be `l < r` instead of `l <= r` to avoid infinite loops in certain cases.
   - The binary search logic itself is incorrect. The problem description specifies that if `p_m <= x`, then `l = m`, otherwise `r = m`. However, the program uses `array[mid] >= find` to update `r = mid - 1` and `l = mid + 1`, which is not consistent with the problem description.

2. **Swap Logic**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the number `x` is already in the correct position after the binary search. It always prints `1` and attempts to swap, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.
   - The program does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed to place `x` in the correct position.

**Example Case**:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  6 3
  1 2 3 4 5 6
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  0
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  1
  3 3
  ```
- Explanation: The number `3` is already in the correct position, so no swaps are needed. However, the program incorrectly prints `1` and attempts to swap `3` with itself, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

To fix the program, the binary search logic should be corrected, and the swap logic should be more carefully handled to ensure that it only performs the necessary swaps and does not exceed the limit of 2 swaps.
