The variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `l <= r`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` and `r` were adjusted based on the value of `array[mid]` compared to `find`. In both cases, the loop can execute again if `l` is less than or equal to `r`.

Since the condition for the loop to continue is `l <= r`, and the state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `l` must be less than or equal to `r`, the loop can certainly execute one more time without any adjustments.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is (`l` + `r`) // 2. If `array[mid]` >= `find`, `r` is updated to `mid` - 2. Otherwise, `l` is updated to `mid` + 1. In both cases, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.**
