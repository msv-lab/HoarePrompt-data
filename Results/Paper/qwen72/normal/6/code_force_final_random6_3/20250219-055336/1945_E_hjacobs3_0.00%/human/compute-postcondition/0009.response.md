The variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`, so we can only adjust these two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `l <= r`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` and `r` were adjusted based on the comparison of `array[mid]` with `find`. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`.
- `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`.
- `n` is the length of `array`.
- `mid` is (`n` - 1) // 2.
- If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, `r` is set to `mid` - 1.
- If `array[mid]` is less than `find`, `l` is set to `mid` + 1.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain the condition `l <= r`. Since `mid` is (`n` - 1) // 2, and `l` and `r` are adjusted based on `mid`, we need to ensure that after the adjustments, `l` is still less than or equal to `r`.

If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, `r` is set to `mid` - 1. This means `r` is now `mid` - 1, and for the loop to continue, `l` must be less than or equal to `mid` - 1.

If `array[mid]` is less than `find`, `l` is set to `mid` + 1. This means `l` is now `mid` + 1, and for the loop to continue, `r` must be greater than or equal to `mid` + 1.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain the condition `l <= r` after the adjustments. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is (`n` - 1) // 2, `l` is `mid` + 1, `r` is `mid` - 1, and `l` must be less than or equal to `r`**
