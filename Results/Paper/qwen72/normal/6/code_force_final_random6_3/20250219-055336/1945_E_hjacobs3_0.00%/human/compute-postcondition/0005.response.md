Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `mid` - 1, `mid` is (`n` - 1) // 2, and the value of `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`.** 

The value of `r` is updated to `mid` - 1, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
