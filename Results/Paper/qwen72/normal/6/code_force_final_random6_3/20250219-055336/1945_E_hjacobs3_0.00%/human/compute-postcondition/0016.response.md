Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is (`l` + `r`) // 2, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`, `r` is `mid` - 1.**

The value of `r` is updated to `mid` - 1, while the other variables (`array`, `find`, `n`, `mid`, and `l`) remain unchanged. The condition that `l` must be less than or equal to `r` is still valid, but `r` is now specifically `mid` - 1.
