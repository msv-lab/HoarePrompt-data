### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the number to find `x`.
   - It then reads the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to perform a binary search on the array.
   - The binary search loop is correctly implemented with the condition `while l <= r`.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
   - The comparison `if array[mid] >= find` is used to adjust the search range:
     - If `array[mid] >= find`, it sets `r = mid - 1`.
     - Otherwise, it sets `l = mid + 1`.

3. **Finding the Correct Position:**
   - After the binary search loop, the program checks if the index `l` (which should be the position where `find` is located if the array were sorted) is equal to the actual index of `find` in the array.
   - If `l` is not equal to the index of `find`, it prints `1` and returns the indices to swap to correct the position.
   - If `l` is equal to the index of `find`, it prints `0` and returns `None`.

4. **Output Handling:**
   - The main loop prints the result of `func_1` for each test case.
   - The function `func_1` prints the number of operations (`0` or `1`) and returns the indices to swap if needed.

5. **Correctness of the Swap Logic:**
   - The program only swaps elements if the binary search does not find the correct position for `x`.
   - The swap is performed between the index `l` and the actual index of `x` in the array.
   - This ensures that `x` is moved to the correct position in the array, making the binary search work correctly.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position by printing `0`.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position by performing a single swap to move `x` to the correct position.

### Challenges to the Original Assessment:

- **Binary Search Initialization:**
  - The binary search initialization in `func_1` sets `l` to `0` and `r` to `n - 1`. However, the problem description specifies that the binary search should start with `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect results because the binary search is not correctly aligned with the problem's constraints.
  - The correct initialization should be `l = 1` and `r = n`.

- **Binary Search Loop Condition:**
  - The loop condition `while l <= r` is correct, but the problem description specifies that the loop should end when `r - l = 1`. This means the loop should continue as long as `r - l > 1`.
  - The correct loop condition should be `while r - l > 1`.

- **Midpoint Calculation:**
  - The midpoint calculation `mid = (l + r) // 2` is correct, but it should be adjusted to fit the new loop condition.

- **Final Check and Swap:**
  - The final check `if l != array.index(find)` is not sufficient to ensure that the binary search will work correctly after the swap.
  - The program should ensure that the swap results in a valid permutation and that the binary search will find `x` at the correct position.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (1, n + 1)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid - 1] >= find:
            r = mid
        else:
            l = mid
    if l != array.index(find) + 1:
        print(1)
        return [str(l), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
    else:
        print(0)
```

### Final Evaluation:

- The original program has a logical error in the binary search initialization and loop condition, which can lead to incorrect results.
- The corrected function aligns with the problem description and ensures the binary search works correctly after the swap.

Final: **False**
