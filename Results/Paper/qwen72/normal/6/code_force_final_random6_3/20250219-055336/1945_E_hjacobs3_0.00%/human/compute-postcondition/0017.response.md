Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is (`l` + `r`) // 2, `l` is `mid + 1`, `r` is unchanged, and `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.** 

In natural language: The initial state remains the same except that the variable `l` is now updated to the value of `mid + 1`. The variable `r` is unchanged, and `l` is still required to be less than or equal to `r`.
