Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `mid` is (`n - 1) // 2, and `array[mid]` is less than `find`**. 

The value of `l` has been updated to `mid + 1`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
