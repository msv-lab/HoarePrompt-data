The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than 1 (since `_` is 1 and will be incremented to 2).

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `results` is a list that includes the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` twice.**
