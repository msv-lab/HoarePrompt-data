The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If `results` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `results` is a list that includes the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` `t` times, which means `results` should have `t` elements for the loop to execute.

For the loop to be executed, `results` must have at least one element, and `result` will be the first element in the `results` list.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `a` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `results` is a list that includes the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` `t` times, `results` must have at least 1 element, `result` is the first element in the `results` list**
