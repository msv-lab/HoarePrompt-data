### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not.
   - The template `t` can have lowercase and uppercase letters.
   - For a string to match the template:
     - If the template has a lowercase letter at position `i`, the string must have the same letter at position `i`.
     - If the template has an uppercase letter at position `i`, the string must have a different letter at position `i`.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - `func_1(n, a, b, c)` is supposed to check if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it, but `c` does not.
   - The function iterates over each position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If this condition is true for any position `i`, it returns 'YES'.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a position, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - `func_2()` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each test case and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the list `results`.

4. **Correctness of Function 1**:
   - The function correctly checks if there exists a position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If such a position exists, it is possible to construct a template `t` where `t[i]` is an uppercase version of `c[i]`, making `a` and `b` match the template but `c` not match it.
   - If no such position exists, it is impossible to construct such a template, and the function correctly returns 'NO'.

5. **Correctness of Function 2**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results.
   - It correctly prints the results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description. It correctly determines if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it, while `c` does not.

Correctness: **True**
