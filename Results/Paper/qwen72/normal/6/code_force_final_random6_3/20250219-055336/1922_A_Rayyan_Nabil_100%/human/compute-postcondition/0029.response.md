Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` and consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It then calls `func_1` with these parameters and appends the result to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element in `results`. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the results of calling `func_1` for each test case have been printed. **
