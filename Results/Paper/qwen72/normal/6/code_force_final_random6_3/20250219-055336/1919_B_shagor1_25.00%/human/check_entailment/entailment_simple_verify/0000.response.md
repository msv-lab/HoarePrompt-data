### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown of why:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined without any parameters, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, the function should take a string `s` as input and return the minimum possible penalty.
   - The function reads `n` and `s` from input inside the loop, which is not necessary if the function were to be defined correctly with `s` as a parameter.

2. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the penalty using the formula `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n`, where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `neg` is the number of "-" characters in `s`.
   - This formula is based on the assumption that the optimal way to split the array is to split it into individual elements, which is not always the case. The optimal splitting strategy should aim to minimize the sum of the penalties of the subarrays.

3. **Optimal Splitting Strategy**:
   - The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array. The optimal strategy involves grouping elements in such a way that the sum of the penalties is minimized.
   - For example, in the case of `s = "++--++"`, the optimal split is `([1,1],[-1,-1],[1,1])`, which results in a total penalty of `0`. The provided program does not consider such groupings and instead uses a simple formula that does not always yield the correct result.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `s = "++--++"`, the program will output `2` because:
     - `n = 6`
     - `neg = 3` (since there are 3 "-" characters)
     - The formula `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n` evaluates to `6 - 2 * 3 = 0` if `n != neg`, but since `n == neg`, it outputs `6`.
   - The correct output should be `0` as shown in the optimal split `([1,1],[-1,-1],[1,1])`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
