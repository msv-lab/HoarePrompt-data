The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the standard input. The string `s` is expected to be of length `n` and consist only of characters "+" and "-". The function calculates the number of "-" characters in `s` and prints the result of `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`. The function does not return any value.
