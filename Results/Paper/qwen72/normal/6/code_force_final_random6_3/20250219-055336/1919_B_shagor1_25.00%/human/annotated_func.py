#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined as it does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(s: str) -> int:` where `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) consisting only of characters "+" and "-", and the function returns an integer representing the minimum possible penalty.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
        
    #State: `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) consisting only of characters "+" and "-", `i` is the last character of `s`, `n` is an input integer, and `neg` is the number of "-" characters in `s`.
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
    #This is printed: n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where n is the length of the string s and neg is the number of "-" characters in s)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the standard input. The string `s` is expected to be of length `n` and consist only of characters "+" and "-". The function calculates the number of "-" characters in `s` and prints the result of `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`. The function does not return any value.
