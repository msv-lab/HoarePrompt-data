Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a while loop. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - This part of the program is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Counting Negatives**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores this count in the variable `neg`.
   - This part of the program is also correct.

3. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the penalty using the formula `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n`.
   - This formula is based on the idea that if the number of '+' and '-' characters is not equal, the penalty is minimized by splitting the array into subarrays that have a sum of zero or as close to zero as possible.
   - However, the formula `n - 2 * neg` is not always correct. It assumes that the optimal way to minimize the penalty is to split the array into subarrays of equal length, which is not necessarily true. The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to split the array such that each subarray has a sum of zero or as close to zero as possible, but the formula does not account for this.

4. **Optimal Splitting**:
   - The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to split the array such that each subarray has a sum of zero or as close to zero as possible.
   - If the number of '+' and '-' characters is equal, the sum of the entire array is zero, and the penalty is zero. This part of the reasoning is correct.
   - If the number of '+' and '-' characters is not equal, the penalty is minimized by splitting the array into subarrays that have a sum of zero or as close to zero as possible. The formula `n - 2 * neg` does not always achieve this. For example, consider the string `s = "--++++"`:
     - The number of '-' characters is 2, and the number of '+' characters is 4.
     - The formula `n - 2 * neg` gives `6 - 2 * 2 = 2`, but the optimal split would be `["--", "++", "++"]`, which results in a penalty of `2 * 2 + 2 * 2 + 2 * 2 = 12`. This is clearly not the minimum possible penalty.

5. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is equal to `neg` (i.e., the string consists entirely of '-' characters). In this case, the penalty is `n` because each subarray will have a penalty of 1, and there will be `n` subarrays.
   - This part of the reasoning is correct.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated penalty for each test case, which is the correct output format.
   - However, the penalty calculated is not always the minimum possible penalty, as shown in the example above.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not always correctly solve the problem by calculating the minimum possible penalty for each test case. The formula used for penalty calculation is flawed and does not account for the optimal splitting of the array.

Final: **False**
