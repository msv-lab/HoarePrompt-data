The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) consisting only of characters "+" and "-". For the loop to execute, `s` must have at least one character.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) consisting only of characters "+" and "-", `i` is the first character of `s`, `n` is an input integer, `neg` is 0**
