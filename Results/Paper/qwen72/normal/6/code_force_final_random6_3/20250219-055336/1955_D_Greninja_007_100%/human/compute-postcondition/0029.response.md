The value of `sm` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq m < n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\), `b` is a list of \(m\) integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^6\), `cb` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m+1]` with `ca[a[m]]` incremented by 1 and `ca[a[0]]` decremented by 1, and `ca[a[r]]` is incremented by 1. The count of `a[r - m]` in `ca` is decreased by 1. If `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, `sm` is decreased by 1. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` and `r` remain the same. `r` is `m + 1`, and `sm` is incremented by 1.**
