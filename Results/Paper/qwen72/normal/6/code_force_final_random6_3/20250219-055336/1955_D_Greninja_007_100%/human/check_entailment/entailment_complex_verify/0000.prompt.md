You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

    return ans
    #The program returns the number of times `sm` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It returns the number of contiguous sublists of length `m` in the list `a` that have at least `k` elements in common with the list `b`. The function maintains the state of the input parameters and the Counter objects `ca` and `cb` throughout its execution. After the function concludes, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` are not modified, and the return value `ans` represents the count of such sublists.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the sliding window mechanism for updating the count of matching elements. Specifically, the logic for updating the `sm` variable is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
5
7 4 2
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4
7 4 3
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4
7 4 4
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4
11 5 3
9 9 2 2 10 9 7 6 3 6 3
6 9 7 8 10
4 1 1
4 1 5 6
6
```

Expected Output:
```
4
3
2
4
1
```

Actual Output:
```
4
3
2
3
1
```

The program fails in the fourth test case. The correct number of good subsegments is 4, but the program outputs 3. The issue arises because the logic for updating the `sm` variable does not correctly account for the changes in the sliding window. Specifically, the conditions for incrementing and decrementing `sm` are not accurate, leading to incorrect counts.
