Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]` with `ca[a[r]]` incremented by 1 and `ca[a[r - m]]` decremented by 1, `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of common elements between `a[:m]` and `b` plus 1 if `ca[a[r]]` was less than `cb[a[r]]` before the increment and `ca[a[r - m]]` was greater than `cb[a[r - m]]` before the decrement, otherwise `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of common elements between `a[:m]` and `b` minus 1 if `ca[a[r - m]]` was equal to `cb[a[r - m]]` before the decrement, otherwise `sm` remains the same. `ans` is 2, and `r` is `m`. Additionally, the current value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
