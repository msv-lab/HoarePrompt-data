Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]` with `ca[a[r]]` incremented by 1, `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of common elements between `a[:m]` and `b` plus 1 if `ca[a[r]]` was less than `cb[a[r]]` before the increment, otherwise `sm` remains the sum of the minimum counts of common elements between `a[:m]` and `b`, `ans` is 1 if `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `r` is `m`, and the count of `a[r - m]` in `ca` is less than or equal to the count of `a[r - m]` in `cb`.**
