Output State: **`a` is a set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `k` is the last integer in the input split by spaces, `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is `k // 2`, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is now a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `f` is 1, `m` is `k // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `m = n = k // 2` assigns the value of `k // 2` to both `m` and `n`.
- The initial value of `n` was `k // 2` minus the number of integers `i` from 1 to `k` that are in the old `b` but not in the new `a`. However, this value is now overridden by `k // 2`.
- The initial value of `m` was `k // 2` minus the number of integers `i` from 1 to `k` that are in the new `a` but not in the new `b`. However, this value is now overridden by `k // 2`.
- The values of `a`, `k`, `t`, `q`, `b`, and `f` remain unchanged.
