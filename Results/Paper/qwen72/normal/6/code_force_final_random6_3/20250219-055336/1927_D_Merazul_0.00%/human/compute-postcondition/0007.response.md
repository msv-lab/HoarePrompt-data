Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a set of `n` unique integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `k` is the last integer in the input split by spaces. `b` is a set of integers generated by the function `R()`. `f` is 1.**
