t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, and queries is a list of q tuples, each containing two integers l and r such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
