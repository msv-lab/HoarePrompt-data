You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing the remaining elements after the loop has executed, which may be fewer than the original list `nums` and could be empty. `ans` is the total count of elements that have been fully reduced to 0 or less during the loop execution. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 * `x` for each iteration, `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`, and `k` is reduced by 2 * `x`. If `a` or `b` are reduced to 0 or less, they are not added back to `nums`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 for each such element. The loop stops when `k` is less than 2 * `x` or when `len(nums)` is less than 2.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns `ans + 1`, where `ans` is the total count of elements that have been fully reduced to 0 or less during the loop execution, and the additional 1 is added because `k` is greater than or equal to the single remaining element in `nums`.
    #State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing the remaining elements after the loop has executed, which may be fewer than the original list `nums` and could be empty. `ans` is the total count of elements that have been fully reduced to 0 or less during the loop execution. `k` is less than `nums[0]` or `len(nums)` is not equal to 1, or both.
    return ans
    #The program returns the total count of elements (`ans`) that have been fully reduced to 0 or less during the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer indicating the length of the list `nums`), `k` (a positive integer representing the total reduction capacity), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns the total count of elements that have been fully reduced to 0 or less during the loop execution. If, after the loop, there is exactly one element left in `nums` and `k` is greater than or equal to this single remaining element, the function returns this count plus one. Otherwise, it returns the count of fully reduced elements. The original list `nums` is transformed into a deque during the function execution, and elements that are not fully reduced are returned in the deque, which may be empty or contain fewer elements than the original list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works for every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Dequeue Usage**: The program uses a `deque` to efficiently manage the ships' durability and to simulate the Kraken's attacks on the first and last ships. This is appropriate because `deque` allows for O(1) time complexity for popping from both ends.

3. **Attack Simulation**:
   - The program correctly alternates between attacking the first and last ships.
   - It calculates the minimum durability between the first and last ships and reduces both by this amount.
   - It updates the remaining attacks (`k`) and the number of ships sunk (`ans`).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When the number of attacks (`k`) is less than the total durability of the first and last ships, the program breaks out of the loop and correctly handles the remaining attacks.
   - If only one ship remains and the Kraken still has attacks left, the program checks if the remaining attacks are enough to sink this ship and updates the count accordingly.

5. **Output**: The program correctly prints the number of ships sunk for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should handle all edge cases and potential inputs correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
