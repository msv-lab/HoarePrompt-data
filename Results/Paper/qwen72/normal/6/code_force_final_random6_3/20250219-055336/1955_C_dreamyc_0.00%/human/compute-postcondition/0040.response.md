Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. `nums` is a deque containing the elements of the original list `nums` minus the first, last, and the two most recently removed elements, and `len(nums)` must be at least 2. `a` is the value of the second element removed from the deque minus the minimum value between the original `a` and `b`. `b` is the value of the second-to-last element removed from the deque minus the minimum value between the updated `a` and `b`. `k` is greater than 0. `x` is the minimum value between the updated `a` and `b`.**

Explanation:
- `b` is updated by subtracting `x` from it.
- `x` is the minimum value between the updated `a` and the original `b`.
- The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- The state of `nums` remains unchanged.
- The updated value of `b` is `b - x`.
- The updated value of `a` is the value of the second element removed from the deque minus the minimum value between the original `a` and `b`.
- The updated value of `x` is the minimum value between the updated `a` and the updated `b`.
