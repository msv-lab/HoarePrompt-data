#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and nums is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
        
        x = min(a, b)
        
        if k >= 2 * x:

    #State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing the remaining elements after the loop has executed, which may be fewer than the original list `nums` and could be empty. `ans` is the total count of elements that have been fully reduced to 0 or less during the loop execution. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 * `x` for each iteration, `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`, and `k` is reduced by 2 * `x`. If `a` or `b` are reduced to 0 or less, they are not added back to `nums`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 for each such element. The loop stops when `k` is less than 2 * `x` or when `len(nums)` is less than 2.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns `ans + 1`, where `ans` is the total count of elements that have been fully reduced to 0 or less during the loop execution, and the additional 1 is added because `k` is greater than or equal to the single remaining element in `nums`.
    #State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing the remaining elements after the loop has executed, which may be fewer than the original list `nums` and could be empty. `ans` is the total count of elements that have been fully reduced to 0 or less during the loop execution. `k` is less than `nums[0]` or `len(nums)` is not equal to 1, or both.
    return ans
    #The program returns the total count of elements (`ans`) that have been fully reduced to 0 or less during the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer indicating the length of the list `nums`), `k` (a positive integer representing the total reduction capacity), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns the total count of elements that have been fully reduced to 0 or less during the loop execution. If, after the loop, there is exactly one element left in `nums` and `k` is greater than or equal to this single remaining element, the function returns this count plus one. Otherwise, it returns the count of fully reduced elements. The original list `nums` is transformed into a deque during the function execution, and elements that are not fully reduced are returned in the deque, which may be empty or contain fewer elements than the original list.
