Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing the elements of the original list `nums` minus the first, last, and the two most recently removed elements, `a` is the value of the first element removed from the deque, `b` is the value of the last element removed from the deque, `k` is greater than 0, `len(nums)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the minimum value between `a` and `b`, `ans` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The conditions that `n` and `k` are positive integers within their specified ranges, `nums` is a deque with the specified elements, `k` is greater than 0, and `len(nums)` is greater than or equal to 0, are still valid.
- The value of `x` is still the minimum value between `a` and `b`.
- The conditions regarding `a` and `b` being reduced by `x` and `k` being reduced by 2 * `x` are not affected by this code snippet.
