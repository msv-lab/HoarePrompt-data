Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing the same elements as the original list `nums` where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while k and len(nums) >= 2:
    a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
    x = min(a, b)
    if k >= 2 * x:
        a -= x
        b -= x
        k -= 2 * x
    else:
        break
    if a > 0:
        nums.appendleft(a)
    else:
        ans += 1
    if b > 0:
        nums.append(b)
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing the elements of the original list `nums` minus the first and last elements. If `b` > 0, `b` is added to the end of `nums`, and if `a` > 0, `a` is added to the beginning of `nums`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 * `x`, then `a` is updated to `a - x`, `b` is updated to `b - x`, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`. If `k` is less than 2 * `x`, then `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a` is 0 or less, `ans` is 1. If `b` is 0 or less, `ans` is 1, and if `a` > 0, `a` is added to the beginning of `nums`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. `nums` is a deque containing the elements of the original list `nums` minus the first, last, and the two most recently removed elements. `a` is the value of the first element removed from the deque, and `b` is the value of the last element removed from the deque. `k` is greater than 0, and `len(nums)` is greater than or equal to 0. `x` is the minimum value between `a` and `b`. If `b` > 0, and if `a` > 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to 2 * `x`, then `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`, and `k` is reduced by 2 * `x`. If `k` is less than 2 * `x`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a` is not greater than 0, `ans` is increased by 1, and the same conditions apply regarding `k` and `x` for `a` and `b`. If `b` > 0, the value of `b` is appended to the end of the deque `nums`. If `b` is not greater than 0, `ans` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. `nums` is a deque containing the elements of the original list `nums` minus the first, last, and the two most recently removed elements, and `len(nums)` must be at least 2. If `a > 0`, `a` is added to the front of `nums`. If `b > 0`, `b` is added to the end of `nums`. If `k >= 2 * x`, then `a` is the value of the second element removed from the deque minus the minimum value between the original `a` and `b`, `b` is the value of the second-to-last element removed from the deque minus the minimum value between the updated `a` and `b`, and `k` is now `k - 2 * x`, where `x` is the minimum value between the updated `a` and `b`. If `k < 2 * x`, then `a` and `b` retain their original values, and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a <= 0`, `ans` is incremented by 1, and if `b <= 0`, `ans` is incremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
