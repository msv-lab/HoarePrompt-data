Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing the remaining elements after the loop has executed, which may be fewer than the original list `nums` and could be empty. `ans` is the total count of elements that have been fully reduced to 0 or less during the loop execution. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 * `x` for each iteration, `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`, and `k` is reduced by 2 * `x`. If `a` or `b` are reduced to 0 or less, they are not added back to `nums`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 for each such element. The loop stops when `k` is less than 2 * `x` or when `len(nums)` is less than 2. Additionally, `k` is a positive integer, `len(nums)` is 1, and `k` is greater than or equal to the single element in `nums`.**
