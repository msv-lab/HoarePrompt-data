The provided code snippet increments the variable `ans` by 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `nums` remain unchanged. The conditions and constraints on `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `nums` as described in the initial state still hold true.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. `nums` is a deque containing the elements of the original list `nums` minus the first, last, and the two most recently removed elements, and `len(nums)` must be at least 2. If `k >= 2 * x`, then `a` is the value of the second element removed from the deque minus the minimum value between the original `a` and `b`, `b` is the value of the second-to-last element removed from the deque minus the minimum value between the updated `a` and `b`, and `k` is now `k - 2 * x`, where `x` is the minimum value between the updated `a` and `b`. If `k < 2 * x`, then `a` and `b` retain their original values, and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans` is now `ans + 1`.**
