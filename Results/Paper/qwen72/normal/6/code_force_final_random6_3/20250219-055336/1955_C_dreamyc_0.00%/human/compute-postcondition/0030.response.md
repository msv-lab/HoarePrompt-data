Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing the elements of the original list `nums` minus the last and the two most recently removed elements, `a` is the value of the first element removed from the deque, `b` is the value of the last element removed from the deque, `k` is greater than 0, `len(nums)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the minimum value between `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 * `x`, then `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`, and `k` is reduced by 2 * `x`. Otherwise, if `k` is less than 2 * `x`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is appended to the left side of the deque `nums`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `x`, and the length of `nums` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `k` and the values of `a` and `b` based on the value of `x` remain the same.
- The only change is that `nums` now includes the value of `a` at its leftmost position.
