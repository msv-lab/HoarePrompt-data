Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 2 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet).
   - `_` is 2 (though `_` is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is a new input integer (though `n` is not used in the code snippet).
   - `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, sorted in descending order.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(nums[0] + nums[1])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
   - `nums[0]` is the largest integer in the list.
   - `nums[1]` is the second largest integer in the list.
   - The `print` statement will add these two largest integers and print the result.

Since the exact values of the integers in the `nums` list are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of the list.

4. **Output:**
   - The code will print the sum of the two largest integers in the `nums` list.
   - Let's denote the largest integer as `nums[0]` and the second largest integer as `nums[1]`.

Output: **nums[0] + nums[1] (where nums[0] is the largest integer in the nums list and nums[1] is the second largest integer in the nums list)**
