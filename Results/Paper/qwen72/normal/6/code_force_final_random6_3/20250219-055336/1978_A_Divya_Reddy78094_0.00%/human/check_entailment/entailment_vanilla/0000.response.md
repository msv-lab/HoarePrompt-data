### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input. It first reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums` for each book.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list `nums` in descending order using `nums.sort(reverse=True)`. This ensures that the largest elements are at the beginning of the list.

3. **Sum of Top Two Elements**: The program then prints the sum of the first two elements of the sorted list `nums[0] + nums[1]`. Since the list is sorted in descending order, `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` are the two largest elements in the list.

4. **Logic for Maximum Pages**: The problem requires Alice to divide the books into two non-empty piles and read the book with the highest number of pages in each pile. By sorting the list and taking the top two elements, the program ensures that Alice reads the two books with the most pages, which is the optimal solution for maximizing the total number of pages read.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases correctly. For example, when `n = 2`, the two books are automatically the two largest, and the program will output their sum. For larger `n`, the program still correctly identifies the two largest books.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will output the maximum total number of pages Alice can read for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
