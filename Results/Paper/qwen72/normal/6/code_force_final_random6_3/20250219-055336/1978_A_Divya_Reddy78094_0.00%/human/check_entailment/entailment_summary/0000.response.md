Reasoning:  
The problem requires finding the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two non-empty piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages in each pile. The provided program sorts the list of page counts in descending order and then prints the sum of the two largest page counts. This approach works because the two largest page counts will always be the maximum pages Alice can read, regardless of how the books are divided into two piles.

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
2. **Book Count and Page List**: For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of page counts `nums`.
3. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list `nums` in descending order. This ensures that the first two elements in the sorted list are the two largest page counts.
4. **Sum Calculation**: The program prints the sum of the two largest page counts, which is the maximum total number of pages Alice can read.

This approach is efficient and correct for the given problem constraints. The program handles multiple test cases and ensures that each test case is processed correctly.

Correctness: **True**
