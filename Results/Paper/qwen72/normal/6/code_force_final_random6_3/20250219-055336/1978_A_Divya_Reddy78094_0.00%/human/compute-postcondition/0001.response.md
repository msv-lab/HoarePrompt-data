The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will be set to 0 (the first value in the range) when the loop starts.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
