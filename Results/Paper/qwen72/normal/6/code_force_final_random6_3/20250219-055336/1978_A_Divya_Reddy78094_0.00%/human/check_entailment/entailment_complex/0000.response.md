Reasoning:  
The function `func` is designed to solve the problem of dividing books into two non-empty piles such that Alice can read the maximum number of pages by reading the book with the highest number of pages from each pile. The function processes multiple test cases, as specified by the input format. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of page counts `nums`. It then sorts `nums` in descending order and prints the sum of the two largest page counts. This approach is correct because the two largest page counts will always be the sum of the pages of the books Alice reads, regardless of how the books are divided into piles, as long as the two largest books are in different piles. The function ensures this by always selecting the two largest values after sorting.

However, the function does not explicitly check if the input values are within the specified constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 500, 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). While this is not strictly necessary for the correctness of the logic (assuming valid inputs as per the problem description), it is a good practice to validate inputs in real-world applications.

The function also does not return any value, which is appropriate since the output is printed directly, as required by the problem statement.

Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the function correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
