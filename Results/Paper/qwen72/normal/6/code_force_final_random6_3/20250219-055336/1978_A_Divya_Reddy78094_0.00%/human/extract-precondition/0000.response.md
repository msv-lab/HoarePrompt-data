Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), representing the number of pages in each book for each test case.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def max_pages(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing the number of pages in the books for a specific test case.
