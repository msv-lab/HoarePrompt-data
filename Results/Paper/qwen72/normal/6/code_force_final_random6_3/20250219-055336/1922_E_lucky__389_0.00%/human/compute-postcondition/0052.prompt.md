Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should accept an integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) as input, and the integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. `x` is now `x - 1`. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while x != 0:
    i = 0
    while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
        i += 1
    if i == 0:
        break
    else:
        subseq_lens.append(i)
        x -= 2 ** i - 1
        mx = max(mx, i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The function accepts an integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) and an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). `x` is now `x - 1` and must be greater than 0. `subseq_lens` is an empty list if `i` is 0, otherwise it contains the value `i`. `mx` is 0 if `i` is 0, otherwise it is the maximum of its original value and `i`. `i` is the largest integer such that 2^i <= x + 1. If `i` is 0, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is updated to `x - 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`x` is now `x - 1` and must be greater than or equal to `2^i - 1`, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and `i` is the largest integer such that `2^i - 1 <= x`. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is now `x - (2^i - 1)`, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value of `i`, and `mx` is `i`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`x` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{i} - 1\), `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value of `1`, and `mx` is `1`. If `i` is `0`, `x` is greater than or equal to `0`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is updated to `x - 2`, and `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
