#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept an integer X (2 \le X \le 10^{18}) as input, and the integer t (1 \le t \le 1000) representing the number of test cases. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(t, X):` where t is the number of test cases and X is the integer for each test case.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of sub-sequences subtracted from `x` during the loop, and `mx` is the maximum length of these sub-sequences.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of sub-sequences and must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, `mx` is the maximum length of these sub-sequences, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` with all elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to `len(subseq_lens) - 1` appended, `i` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: - The `print(len(ansv))` statement will print the length of `ansv`.
    #
    #Given the initial state, the length of `ansv` is calculated as:
    #- `mx + (len(subseq_lens) - 1)`
    #
    #Output:
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of sub-sequences and must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, `mx` is the maximum length of these sub-sequences, `ansv` must have at least `len(subseq_lens) + mx - 1` elements, `i` is `len(ansv) - 1`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline character)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `x` from the user input, processes it to generate a list `ansv` of integers, and prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces. The list `ansv` contains integers from 0 to `mx-1` (where `mx` is the maximum length of sub-sequences found during processing) and additional elements from the list `subseq_lens` (excluding the first element). The final state of the program is that `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the lengths of sub-sequences, `mx` is the maximum length of these sub-sequences, and `ansv` contains the specified elements.
