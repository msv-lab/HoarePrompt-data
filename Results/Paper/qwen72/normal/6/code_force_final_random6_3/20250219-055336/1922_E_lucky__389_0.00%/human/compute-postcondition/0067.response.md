Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is 0.
   - `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of sub-sequences and must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements.
   - `mx` is the maximum length of these sub-sequences.
   - `ansv` must have at least `len(subseq_lens) + 2` elements.
   - `i` is `len(subseq_lens) + 1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(ansv[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `i` is defined as `len(subseq_lens) + 1`.
   - `ansv` must have at least `len(subseq_lens) + 2` elements.
   - Therefore, `i` is a valid index for `ansv` because `i` is `len(subseq_lens) + 1`, which is within the bounds of `ansv` (since `ansv` has at least `len(subseq_lens) + 2` elements).

4. **What is printed:**
   - The code will print the element at index `i` of the list `ansv`.
   - Since `i` is `len(subseq_lens) + 1`, the element printed will be the second-to-last element of `ansv`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the second-to-last element of the list `ansv`.

Output: **ansv[len(subseq_lens) + 1] (where ansv[len(subseq_lens) + 1] is the second-to-last element of the list ansv)**
