The function `func_1` should accept two parameters: `t` and `X`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \le t \le 1000\). `X` is an integer for each test case, where \(2 \le X \le 10^{18}\).

Since the provided function definition does not include these parameters, the correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, X):`.

However, the output is not specified in the provided information. Without knowing the specific output, it is not possible to fully describe the functionality of the function. Assuming the function is meant to return some result based on `X` for each test case, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (the number of test cases) and `X` (an integer for each test case). It returns a result based on the value of `X` for each test case.**
