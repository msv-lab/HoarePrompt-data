The code snippet `mx = max(mx, i)` updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Since `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value `i`, we know `i` is a specific value. However, the initial value of `mx` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `mx`. The value of `x` is updated to `x - 2`, but this change is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`subseq_lens` is a list containing the value `i`, `x` is `x - 2`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `i`.**
