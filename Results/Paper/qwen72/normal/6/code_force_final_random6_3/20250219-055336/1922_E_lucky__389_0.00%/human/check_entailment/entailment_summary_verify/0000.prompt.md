You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Program:
import math

MOD = 1000000007
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `x` from the user input, processes it to generate a list `ansv` of integers, and prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces. The list `ansv` contains integers from 0 to `mx-1` (where `mx` is the maximum length of sub-sequences found during processing) and additional elements from the list `subseq_lens` (excluding the first element). The final state of the program is that `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the lengths of sub-sequences, `mx` is the maximum length of these sub-sequences, and `ansv` contains the specified elements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `X` is a power of 2. For example, if `X = 4`, the program will output an incorrect result. According to the problem description, an array with exactly 4 increasing subsequences should be possible, but the program fails to generate such an array. Instead, it incorrectly subtracts 1 from `X` and then tries to find an array for `X - 1`, which leads to an incorrect solution. The program should handle the case where `X` is a power of 2 correctly by generating an appropriate array.
