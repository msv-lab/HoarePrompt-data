Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `x` from the user input, processes it to generate a list `ansv` of integers, and prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces. The list `ansv` contains integers from 0 to `mx-1` (where `mx` is the maximum length of sub-sequences found during processing) and additional elements from the list `subseq_lens` (excluding the first element). The final state of the program is that `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the lengths of sub-sequences, `mx` is the maximum length of these sub-sequences, and `ansv` contains the specified elements. **
