Postcondition: ***`x` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{i} - 1\), `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value of `1`, and `mx` is `1`. If `i` is `0`, `x` is greater than or equal to `0`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is updated to `x - 2`, and `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`.***
