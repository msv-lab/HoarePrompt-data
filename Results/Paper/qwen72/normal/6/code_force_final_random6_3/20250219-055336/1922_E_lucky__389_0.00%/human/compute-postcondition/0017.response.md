Output State: **`subseq_lens` is a list containing the value `i`, `x` is `x - 2 ** i + 1`, `mx` is 0, `i` is the largest integer such that 2^i <= x + 1, `x` must be at least 1, and `i` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `x - 2 ** i + 1`.
- The other variables (`subseq_lens`, `mx`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `x` must be greater than 0 and at least 1 is still valid.
- The precondition that `i` is the largest integer such that 2^i <= x + 1 and `i` is not equal to 0 is still valid.
