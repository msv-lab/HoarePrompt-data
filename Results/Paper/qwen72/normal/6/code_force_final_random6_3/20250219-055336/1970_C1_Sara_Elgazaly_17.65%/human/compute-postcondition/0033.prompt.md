Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `_` is `x - 2`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` `x - 1` times, `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` `x - 1` times, `s` is True, and `lst[x]` is not an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while lst[x]:
    y = lst[x].pop()
    if lst[y] != []:
        x = y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `_` is `x - 2`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` `x - 1` times, `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` `x - 1` times, `s` is True, `lst[x]` is not an empty list, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the execution, `lst[x]` is now one element shorter. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, `x` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the execution, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`x` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `_` is `x - 2`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` `x - 1` times, `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` `x - 1` times, `s` is True, `lst[x]` is now one element shorter and still contains at least one element, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the execution. If `lst[y]` is not empty, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `x` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `_` is `x - 2`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` `x - 1` times, `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` `x - 1` times, `s` is True, `lst[x]` is now one element shorter and still contains at least one element, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the execution, and `y` has been removed from `lst[x]`. If `lst[y]` is not empty, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
