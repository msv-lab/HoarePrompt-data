Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is now `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `a[r]` was 0, otherwise `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `sunks` is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 if `a[r]` was 0, otherwise `sunks` is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`, and `k` is now `k - a[l] * 2`. If `l` == `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
