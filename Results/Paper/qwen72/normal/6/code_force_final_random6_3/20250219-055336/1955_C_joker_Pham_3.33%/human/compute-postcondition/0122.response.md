Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, 1, or 2, `r` is n - 1, n - 2, n - 2, or n - 3, `sunks` is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. If `a[l]` == 0, `l` is updated to 1, 2, or 3, and `sunks` is updated to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. Otherwise, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`, `k` is updated to `k - a[r] * 2`, and if `a[r]` == 0, `r` is updated to n - 2, n - 3, n - 3, or n - 4, and `sunks` is updated to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11. If `l` == `r` and `k` >= `a[r]`, or if `k` < `a[l] * 2` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `a[l] > a[r]`, the values of `l`, `r`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.***
