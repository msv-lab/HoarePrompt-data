Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2 depending on whether `a[r]` was 0, `sunks` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the conditions. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]` and `k` was greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, `l` is 1, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2 if `a[r]` was 0, `sunks` is 1 or 2 if `a[r]` was 0, `k` is now 0, and `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[0]` or 0 if `a[r]` was 0. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]` and `k` was less than `a[l] * 2` but `a[l] * 2 - 1` is equal to `k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
