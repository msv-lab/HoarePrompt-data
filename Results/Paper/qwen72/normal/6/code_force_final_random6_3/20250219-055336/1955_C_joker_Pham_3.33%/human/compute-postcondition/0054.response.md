Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is n - 1, n - 2, n - 3, or n - 4 depending on the initial values of `l` and `r` and the updates within the if block, `sunks` is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the initial value of `sunks` and the updates within the if block. The current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]` before any updates. If `k` is greater than or equal to twice the current value of `a[r]`, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[l]` was 0, `l` is updated to 1 or 2, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. If `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`, the current value of `a[r]` remains less than the current value of `a[l]`, and `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`. If `a[r] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `sunks` is 0, 1, or 2. In both cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
