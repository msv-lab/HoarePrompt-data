Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2 depending on whether `a[r]` was 0, `sunks` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `a[r]` was 0, `k` is now `k - 2 * a[l]`, and `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]` or 0 if `a[r]` was 0. The value of `k` is still greater than or equal to twice the value of `a[l]` after the subtraction.**
