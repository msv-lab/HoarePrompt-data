Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2 depending on whether `a[r]` was 0, `sunks` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the conditions. The current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`, and `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`. Additionally, `a[r] * 2 - 1` equals `k`.**
