Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` remains 0, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`, and the condition `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k` is false. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
