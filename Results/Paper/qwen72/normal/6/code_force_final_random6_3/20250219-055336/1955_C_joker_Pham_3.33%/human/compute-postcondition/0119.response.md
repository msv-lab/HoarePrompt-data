Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, 1, or 2, `r` is n - 1, n - 2, n - 2, or n - 3, `sunks` is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, `k` is updated to `k - a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`. If `a[r]` == 0, `r` is updated to n - 2, n - 3, n - 3, or n - 4, and `sunks` is updated to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11. If `l` == `r` and `k` >= `a[r]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` < `a[l] * 2` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l] > a[r]`, the values of `l`, `r`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.** 

In natural language, the output state is:
- `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 200,000.
- `k` is updated to its original value minus `a[r] * 2`.
- `a` remains a list of `n` positive integers, but the value of `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`.
- `l` remains 0, 1, 1, or 2.
- `r` is updated to `n - 2`, `n - 3`, `n - 3`, or `n - 4` if `a[r]` is 0.
- `sunks` is updated to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 if `a[r]` is 0.
- If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `k` is less than `a[l] * 2` and `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `a[l]` is greater than `a[r]`, the values of `l`, `r`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.
