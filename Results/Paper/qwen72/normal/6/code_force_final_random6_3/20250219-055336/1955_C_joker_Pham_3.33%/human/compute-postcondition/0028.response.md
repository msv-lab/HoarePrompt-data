Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1. If `l` is equal to `r`, and `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to the value of `a[r]`, `sunks` is set to 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0. Additionally, the value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the value of `a[r]`. The value of `k` is less than the value of `a[l] * 2`. The condition `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k` is false.**
