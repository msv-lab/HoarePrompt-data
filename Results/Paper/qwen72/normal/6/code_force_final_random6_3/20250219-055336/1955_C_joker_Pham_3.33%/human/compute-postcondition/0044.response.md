Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < 10^15 (updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`), `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2 depending on whether `a[r]` was 0, `sunks` is 1, 2, or 3 (depending on the initial value of `sunks`), `a[r]` is less than `a[l]` (before the update), and `k` is greater than or equal to twice the current value of `a[r]` (after the update). If `a[l]` was 0, `l` is now 1 or 2, `sunks` is 2, 3, or 4 depending on the initial value of `sunks`, and `a[l]` is now 0. Otherwise, `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]` and `sunks` is 1, 2, or 3 depending on the initial value of `sunks`.**
