Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is now the next value in the range (0 to `t-1`), `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**

Explanation:
- The variable `cost` is calculated using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
- `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`.
- `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, where `k` is `L[2]`.
- `n` is the length of `N`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged.
- The value of `cost` is the result of the given formula, which combines the sum of the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M` multiplied by `m`, and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers (0 to `n-1`) multiplied by `m * m`.
