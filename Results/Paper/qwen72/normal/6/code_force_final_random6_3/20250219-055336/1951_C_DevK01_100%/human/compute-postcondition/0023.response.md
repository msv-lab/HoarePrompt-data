Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is not explicitly set before the loop but will be assigned the next value in the range (0 to `t-1`), `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` or `q-1` elements of `M` depending on the condition, `cost` is calculated as described, and `w` and `mu` are set if `n * m` is not equal to `k`. `M` is now a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `M`.
- This updates the value of `M` to a list of integers provided by the user.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
