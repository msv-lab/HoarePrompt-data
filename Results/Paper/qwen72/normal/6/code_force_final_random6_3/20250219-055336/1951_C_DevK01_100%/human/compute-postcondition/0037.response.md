Let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code to determine what will be printed by the `print(cost)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be at least 1.
- `_` is not explicitly set before the loop but will be assigned the next value in the range (0 to `t-1`).
- `L` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
- `n` is the length of `N`.
- `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
- `k` is `L[2]`.
- `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.
- `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.
- If `n * m` == `k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- If `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `m` and `k`**:
   - `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
   - `k` is `L[2]`.

2. **Calculate `q`**:
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.

3. **Form the list `N`**:
   - `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.

4. **Determine the length `n` of `N`**:
   - `n` is the length of `N`.

5. **Check the condition `n * m == k`**:
   - If `n * m == k`, then:
     - `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - If `n * m != k`, then:
     - `N` is updated to a list containing the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element.
     - `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
     - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
     - `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Final Output:
The `print(cost)` statement will print the value of `cost` based on the conditions and calculations described above. The exact numerical value of `cost` depends on the specific values of `L` and `M` provided by the user. However, we can describe the value of `cost` in terms of the variables and their relationships.

If `n * m == k`:
- `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.

If `n * m != k`:
- `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `L = [1, 2, 7]` and `M = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` for a concrete example.

1. **Determine `m` and `k`**:
   - `m = min(L[1], L[2]) = min(2, 7) = 2`.
   - `k = L[2] = 7`.

2. **Calculate `q`**:
   - `q = ceil(7 / 2) = 4`.

3. **Form the list `N`**:
   - `N = M[:4] = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.

4. **Determine the length `n` of `N`**:
   - `n = len(N) = 4`.

5. **Check the condition `n * m == k`**:
   - `n * m = 4 * 2 = 8`.
   - Since `8 != 7`, we use the second condition.

6. **Update `N`**:
   - `N = N[:-1] = [1, 2, 3]`.
   - `w = N[-1] = 4`.
   - `mu = k - (n - 1) * m = 7 - (3) * 2 = 1`.

7. **Calculate `cost`**:
   - `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.
   - `cost = 1 * 4 + 2 * (1 + 2 + 3) + 2 * 2 * ((3) * 4 // 2) + 4 * 2 * 1`.
   - `cost = 4 + 2 * 6 + 4 * 6 + 8`.
   - `cost = 4 + 12 + 24 + 8`.
   - `cost = 48`.

### Final Output:
Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the provided lists `L` and `M` and the conditions described)**

For the given example, the output would be:
Output: **48**
