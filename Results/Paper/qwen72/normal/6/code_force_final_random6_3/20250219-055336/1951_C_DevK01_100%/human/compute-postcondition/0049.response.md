Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is now the next value in the range (0 to `t-1`), `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `N` is now a list containing the first `q-1` elements of the sorted `M`.**

Explanation:
- The code `w = N.pop()` removes the last element from the list `N` and assigns it to the variable `w`.
- The length of `N` is now `q-1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
