The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are directly modified by this statement, the values of all variables remain unchanged. However, the program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if the loop has ended.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is now the next value in the range (0 to `t-1`), `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. If `n * m == k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of the sorted `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`. The program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if the loop has ended.**
