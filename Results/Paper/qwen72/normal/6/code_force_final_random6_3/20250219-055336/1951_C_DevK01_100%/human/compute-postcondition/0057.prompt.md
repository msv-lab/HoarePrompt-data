Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought, respectively. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
    m = min(m, k)
    M.sort()
    q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
    N = M[:q]
    n = len(N)
    if n * m == k:
        cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
    else:
        w = N.pop()
        mu = k - (n - 1) * m
        cost = mu * w
        n = len(N)
        cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu
    print(cost)
    continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be at least 1, `_` is not explicitly set before the loop but will be assigned values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop's execution, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. If `n * m` is equal to `k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, if `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (q-2) * m`, and `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`. The `continue` statement is encountered, so the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the loop continues with the next iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be at least 1, `_` is not explicitly set before the loop but will be assigned the next value in the range (0 to `t-1`), `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `n` is now the length of `N`, `m` is now the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is now `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`. If `n * m` == `k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. If `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`. The loop will skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next value of `_`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be at least 1, `_` is now the next value in the range (0 to `t-1`), `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. If `n * m == k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of the sorted `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`. The program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if the loop has ended.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
