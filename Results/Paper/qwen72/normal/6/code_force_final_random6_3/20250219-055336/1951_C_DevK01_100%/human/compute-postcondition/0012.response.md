Postcondition: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is not explicitly set before the loop but will be assigned values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop's execution, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `n * m` is not equal to `k`.**
