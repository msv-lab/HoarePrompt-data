The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow of the loop.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is not explicitly set before the loop but will be assigned the next value in the range (0 to `t-1`), `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `n` is now the length of `N`, `m` is now the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is now `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`. If `n * m` == `k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. If `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`. The loop will skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next value of `_`.**
