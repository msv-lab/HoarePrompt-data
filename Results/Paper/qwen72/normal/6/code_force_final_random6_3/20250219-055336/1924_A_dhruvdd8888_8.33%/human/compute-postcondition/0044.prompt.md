Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the characters of `s` that were the last character to complete a set of `k` unique characters in `s`, and `ps` is the number of times the set `win` was cleared. Additionally, `ps` is less than `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in us:
    if i not in win:
        print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the characters of `s` that were the last character to complete a set of `k` unique characters in `s`, `ps` is the number of times the set `win` was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`, `i` is the first element of `us`. If `i` is not in `win`, then `i` is not in `win`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the characters of `s` that were the last character to complete a set of `k` unique characters in `s`, `ps` is the number of times the set `win` was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`, `i` is the second element of `us`. If `i` is not in `win`, then `i` is not in `win`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the characters of `s` that were the last character to complete a set of `k` unique characters in `s`, `ps` is the number of times the set `win` was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`, `i` is the next element of `us` after the second element. If `i` is not in `win`, then `i` is not in `win`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
