Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the characters of `s` that were the last character to complete a set of `k` unique characters in `s`, and `ps` is the number of times the set `win` was cleared. Additionally, `ps` is less than `n`.**
