Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the first character of `s`. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) == k`, then `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s`, and `ps` is 1. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) != k`, then `win` is a set containing the first character of `s`, and `ans` is an empty list. If `i` is not in `us`, then `win` remains an empty set, `ans` remains an empty list, and `ps` remains 0.***
