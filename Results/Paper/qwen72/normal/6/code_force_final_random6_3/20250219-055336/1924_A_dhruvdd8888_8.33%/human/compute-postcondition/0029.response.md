Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the characters of `s` that were the last character to complete a set of `k` unique characters in `s`, and `ps` is the number of times the set `win` was cleared.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- The string `s` and the set `us` also remain unchanged.
- The set `win` is an empty set after the loop completes, as it is cleared every time it reaches a size of `k`.
- The list `ans` contains the characters from `s` that were the last to complete a set of `k` unique characters in the window `win`. Each time `win` reaches a size of `k`, the current character `i` is added to `ans`.
- The variable `ps` is the count of how many times the set `win` was cleared, which corresponds to the number of times a complete set of `k` unique characters was formed in `win`.
