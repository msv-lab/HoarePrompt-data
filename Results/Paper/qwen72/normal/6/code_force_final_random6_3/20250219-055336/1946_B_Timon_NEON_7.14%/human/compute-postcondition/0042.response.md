Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is `[arr[1], 1]`, `segments_variants` is `[[arr[1], 1, 1]]`, and `new_segment` is `[arr[1], 1]`.**

The code snippet `max_segment = new_segment` updates the value of `max_segment` to be the same as `new_segment`. Since `new_segment` was `[arr[1], 1]`, `max_segment` is now also `[arr[1], 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
