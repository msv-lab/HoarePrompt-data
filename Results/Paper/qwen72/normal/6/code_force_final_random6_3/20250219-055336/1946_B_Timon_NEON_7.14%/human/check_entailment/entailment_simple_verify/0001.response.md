### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum back into the array.
   - The final result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the array contains all non-negative numbers, the optimal strategy is to repeatedly take the entire array as the subarray and insert its sum.
   - If the array contains negative numbers, the optimal strategy is to focus on the positive segments and avoid negative numbers.
   - If the array is entirely negative, the optimal strategy is to take an empty subarray, which adds zero to the array, and repeat this `k` times.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** This function correctly returns the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) of a given number. It is necessary for the final output and is implemented correctly.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** This function is intended to find the maximum sum subarray and its indices. However, there are several issues:
     - The function does not handle the case where the array is entirely negative correctly. It should return a sum of zero in this case.
     - The function does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray. It incorrectly updates `max_segment` and `new_segment` in a way that can lead to incorrect results.
     - The function appends segments to `segments_variants` in a way that is not optimal and can lead to incorrect results.
     - The function returns `total_max_segment`, which is a list. If the array is entirely negative, it should return a sum of zero, but it returns `[-1]` instead.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):** This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operation. It is supposed to calculate the final result based on the maximum sum subarray and the number of operations, but it is not implemented.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray.
   - The program does not handle the case where the array is entirely negative.
   - The program does not correctly calculate the final result after `k` operations.
   - The program is incomplete and lacks the necessary logic to solve the problem as described.

5. **Annotated Code Evaluation:**
   - The annotated code confirms that `func_2` is not correctly identifying the maximum sum subarray. It appends segments to `segments_variants` in a non-optimal way and does not handle the case where the array is entirely negative.
   - The main logic in the annotated code uses the result of `func_2` to calculate the final answer, but since `func_2` is incorrect, the final answer will also be incorrect.
   - The main logic assumes that `max_segment[0]` will always be the maximum sum subarray, but this is not guaranteed due to the issues in `func_2`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. It lacks the necessary logic to handle different cases and calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.

Final: **False**
