Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and `new_segment` is not empty*** 

However, since the if condition is `if (new_segment):` and we are entering the else block, the correct postcondition should be:

Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and `new_segment` is empty***
