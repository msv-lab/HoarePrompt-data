Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is 2, and `max_sum` is -1. If `new_segment` is set, and `arr[2]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is either [first element of `arr` + `arr[1]` + `arr[2]`, 0] or [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1] or [[arr[0], 0, 0]], and [[first element of `arr` + `arr[1]` + `arr[2]`, 0, 1] or [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0, 1]]. If `new_segment` is set and `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` is [first element of `arr` + `arr[1]` + `arr[2]`, 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1] or [[arr[0], 0, 0]], and `new_segment[0]` is `first element of `arr` + `arr[1]` + `arr[2]`. If `new_segment` is not set and `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing [[arr[0], 0, 0]] if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, or [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1]] if `arr[0]` is less than 0, and `new_segment` is [arr[2], 2]. If `new_segment` is not set and `arr[2]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing [[arr[0], 0, 0]] if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, or [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1]] if `arr[0]` is less than 0, and `new_segment` is not set.***
