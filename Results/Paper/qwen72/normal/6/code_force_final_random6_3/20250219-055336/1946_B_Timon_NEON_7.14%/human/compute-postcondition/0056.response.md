Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least `len(arr)` elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the last segment of positive integers and its starting index, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of positive integers found and its starting index, `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a segment of positive integers, its starting index, and its ending index, and now `segments_variants` includes an additional list which is `new_segment` appended with `len(arr) - 1`, `total_max_segment` is [-1].**

The code initializes a new list `total_max_segment` with a single element, which is -1. This does not affect the other variables, so their states remain as they were in the initial state. The list `total_max_segment` is now a list with a single element, -1.
