Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and the first element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` updates the first element of `max_segment` by adding the first element of `arr` to it.
- Since `i` is 0 and `max_segment` initially is [0, 0], `max_segment[0]` becomes `arr[0]`.
- All other variables (`arr`, `i`, `new_segment`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`) remain unchanged.
- The precondition that the first element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0 is still valid.
