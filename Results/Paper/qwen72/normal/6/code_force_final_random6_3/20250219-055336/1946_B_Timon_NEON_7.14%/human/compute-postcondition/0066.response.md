Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least `len(arr)` elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the last segment of positive integers and its starting index, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of positive integers found and its starting index, `segments_variants` must have at least 3 elements, `segment` is the third element in `segments_variants`. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to be the third element in `segments_variants`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.**
