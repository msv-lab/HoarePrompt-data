Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing [[arr[0], 0, 0]] if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, or [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1]] if `arr[0]` is less than 0. `new_segment` is [arr[2], 2] if `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to 0, or not set if `arr[2]` is less than 0.**
