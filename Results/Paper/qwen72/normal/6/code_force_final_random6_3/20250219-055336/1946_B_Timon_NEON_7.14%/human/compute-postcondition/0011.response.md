Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is an empty list, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `[-1]`, `max_sum` is -1, the condition `(new_segment)` is false, the first element of `arr` is less than 0, and `max_segment[0]` is less than or equal to `new_segment[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `max_segment = new_segment` updates the value of `max_segment` to be the same as `new_segment`, which is an empty list. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
