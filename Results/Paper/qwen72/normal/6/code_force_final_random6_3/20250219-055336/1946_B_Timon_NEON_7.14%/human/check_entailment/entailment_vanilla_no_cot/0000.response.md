Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incomplete and contains logical and structural issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem. Here are the main issues:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function simply returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). While this is a part of the solution, it is not sufficient on its own to solve the problem.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function attempts to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, but it has several issues:
   - It incorrectly handles the segments and their indices.
   - It does not correctly update the `max_segment` and `new_segment` lists.
   - It appends segments to `segments_variants` in a way that can lead to incorrect results.
   - It does not handle the case where the array is entirely negative correctly.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function is incomplete and does not contain any logic to solve the problem. It is just a placeholder with an empty body.

4. **Overall Logic**: The program lacks the main logic to perform the operations described in the problem. It does not handle the multiple test cases, and it does not correctly compute the maximum possible sum of the array after \(k\) operations.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to:
- Handle multiple test cases.
- Compute the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
- Use this maximum sum to perform the operations and compute the final result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_sum_after_operations(t, test_cases):
    MOD = 1000000007
    
    def max_subarray_sum(arr):
        max_sum = 0
        current_sum = 0
        for num in arr:
            current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
        return max_sum
    
    results = []
    for n, k, arr in test_cases:
        initial_sum = sum(arr)
        max_subarray = max_subarray_sum(arr)
        
        if max_subarray <= 0:
            # If the maximum subarray sum is non-positive, the best we can do is to add zeros
            result = initial_sum
        else:
            # If the maximum subarray sum is positive, we can add it k times
            result = initial_sum + max_subarray * k
        
        results.append(result % MOD)
    
    return results

# Example usage:
t = 12
test_cases = [
    (2, 2, [-4, -7]),
    (3, 3, [2, 2, 8]),
    (1, 7, [7]),
    (5, 1, [4, -2, 8, -12, 9]),
    (7, 4, [8, 14, -9, 6, 0, -1, 3]),
    (7, 100, [5, 3, -8, 12, -5, -9, 3]),
    (6, 1000, [-1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000]),
    (2, 1, [1000000000, 8]),
    (5, 4, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]),
    (6, 10, [48973, 757292, 58277, -38574, 27475, 999984]),
    (7, 1, [-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000, -1000, 1000, -1000]),
    (10, 10050, [408293874, -3498597, 7374783, 295774930, -48574034, 26623784, 498754833, -294875830, 283045804, 85938045])
]

results = max_sum_after_operations(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected program:
- Handles multiple test cases.
- Computes the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray using Kadane's algorithm.
- Uses this maximum sum to compute the final result after \(k\) operations.
- Returns the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
