### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the array contains all non-negative numbers, the optimal strategy is to repeatedly take the entire array as the subarray and insert its sum.
   - If the array contains negative numbers, the optimal strategy is to focus on the positive segments and avoid negative numbers as much as possible.
   - If the array is entirely negative, the optimal strategy is to take an empty subarray, which adds zero to the array, and repeat this `k` times.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** This function correctly returns the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) of a given number. This is necessary for the final output and is implemented correctly.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** This function is intended to find the maximum sum subarray and its indices. However, there are several issues:
     - The function does not handle the case where the array is entirely negative correctly. It should return a segment with a sum of zero in such cases.
     - The function does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray. It incorrectly appends segments to `segments_variants` and does not handle the logic for finding the maximum sum subarray efficiently.
     - The function appends segments to `segments_variants` in a way that is not optimal and can lead to incorrect results.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):** This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operation. It is supposed to calculate the final result based on the maximum sum subarray and the number of operations, but it is not implemented.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray.
   - The program does not handle the case where the array is entirely negative.
   - The program does not correctly calculate the final result after `k` operations.
   - The program is incomplete and lacks the necessary logic to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. It lacks the necessary logic to handle different cases and calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.

Final: **False**
