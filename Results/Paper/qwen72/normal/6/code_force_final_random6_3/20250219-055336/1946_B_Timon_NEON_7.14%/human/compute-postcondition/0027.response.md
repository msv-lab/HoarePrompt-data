Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is a list with the first element equal to `arr[0]`, `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing [[arr[0], 0, 0]].**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 1, and `max_sum` is -1.
- If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to a list with the first element equal to `arr[0]`, `max_segment` is set to [arr[0], 0], and `segments_variants` remains an empty list.
- The code snippet `segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])` appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list is `new_segment` plus `[i - 1]`.
- Since `i` is 1, `i - 1` is 0.
- Therefore, `segments_variants` now contains the list `[arr[0], 0, 0]`.
- The values of `arr`, `i`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged.
- The value of `new_segment` and `max_segment` are as specified in the initial state, and `segments_variants` now includes the new list.
