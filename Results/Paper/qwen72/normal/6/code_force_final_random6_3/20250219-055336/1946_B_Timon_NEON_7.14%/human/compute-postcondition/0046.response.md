Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is [first element of `arr` + `arr[1]` + `arr[2]`, 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1]] or [[arr[0], 0, 0]], depending on the initial value of `arr[0]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `max_segment[0]` is incremented by `arr[i]`, where `i` is 2. If `arr[0]` is less than 0, `max_segment` was initially set to [first element of `arr` + `arr[1]`, 0]. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` was initially set to [arr[0] + arr[1], 0]. In both cases, `max_segment[0]` is now the sum of the first three elements of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
