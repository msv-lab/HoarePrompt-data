Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 1, and `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[0]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is set to [first element of `arr` + `arr[1]`, 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1]]. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to [arr[0] + arr[1]], `max_segment` is set to [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing [[arr[0], 0, 0]]. If `arr[0]` is less than 0 and `new_segment` is not set, `segments_variants` remains as [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1]]. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `new_segment` is not set, `new_segment` is set to [arr[1], 1], and `segments_variants` remains an empty list.***
