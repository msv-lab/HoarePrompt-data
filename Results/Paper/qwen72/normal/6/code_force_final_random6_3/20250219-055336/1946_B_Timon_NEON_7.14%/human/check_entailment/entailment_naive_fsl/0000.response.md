Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program is incomplete and does not fully implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The function `func_3` is not fully implemented. It is supposed to perform the operations and return the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, but it currently only initializes `answer` to 0 and does not contain any logic to perform the operations.

2. **Logical Inconsistencies**: The function `func_2` attempts to find the maximum segment sum, but it does not handle the logic for performing `k` operations correctly. The function does not consider the possibility of inserting the sum of the entire array multiple times, which is a key part of the problem.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as when the array contains only negative numbers or when the array is empty. For example, if the array is `[-1, -2, -3]` and `k` is 1, the program should return the sum of the array itself, but it does not handle this case correctly.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The function `func_1` is used to return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`, but this function is not integrated into the main logic of the program.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus it is incorrect.
