You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers and we need to perform `k` operations.
   - In each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray of `a` and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations, and the result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the array contains all non-negative numbers, the optimal strategy is to repeatedly take the entire array as the subarray and insert its sum.
   - If the array contains negative numbers, the optimal strategy is to avoid negative numbers as much as possible and focus on the positive segments.
   - If the array is entirely negative, the optimal strategy is to take an empty subarray, which adds zero to the array, and repeat this `k` times.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** This function returns the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) of a given number. This is correct and necessary for the final output.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** This function is intended to find the maximum sum subarray and its indices. However, there are several issues:
     - The function does not handle the case where the array is entirely negative correctly.
     - The function does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray.
     - The function appends segments to `segments_variants` in a way that is not optimal and can lead to incorrect results.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):** This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operation. It is supposed to calculate the final result based on the maximum sum subarray and the number of operations, but it is not implemented.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray.
   - The program does not handle the case where the array is entirely negative.
   - The program does not correctly calculate the final result after `k` operations.
   - The program is incomplete and lacks the necessary logic to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. It lacks the necessary logic to handle different cases and calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.
