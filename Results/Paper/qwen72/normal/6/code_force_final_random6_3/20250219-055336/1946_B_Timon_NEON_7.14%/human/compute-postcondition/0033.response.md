Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1]] if `arr[0]` is less than 0, or `segments_variants` remains an empty list if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment[0]` is now `arr[0] + arr[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `new_segment[0]` is updated by adding `arr[i]` to it.
- Since `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is `arr[1]`.
- The initial value of `new_segment[0]` is `arr[0]` (from the initial state).
- Therefore, `new_segment[0]` becomes `arr[0] + arr[1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
