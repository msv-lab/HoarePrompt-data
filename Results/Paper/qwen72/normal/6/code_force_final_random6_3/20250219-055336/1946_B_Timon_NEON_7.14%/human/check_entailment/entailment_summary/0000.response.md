### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final answer should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(number)`:**
     - This function takes an integer `number` and returns the remainder when `number` is divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
     - It is used to ensure the final answer is within the required range.

   - **`func_2(arr)`:**
     - This function is designed to find the maximum segment sum in the array `arr`.
     - It iterates through the array and keeps track of the maximum segment sum and its indices.
     - If the array contains only negative numbers, it returns `[-1]`.
     - The function returns a list containing the maximum segment sum and its indices.

   - **`func_3(number, quantity)`:**
     - This function is defined but does not perform any useful operation. It always returns `0` and does not modify its input parameters.
     - This function is not used in the main logic of the program and can be considered redundant.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and calls `func_2(a)` to find the maximum segment sum.
   - If the maximum segment sum is negative, it is set to `0`.
   - The answer is calculated as `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - Finally, `func_1(answer)` is called to return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The main logic correctly handles the input and output format.
   - The use of `func_2` to find the maximum segment sum is appropriate for the problem.
   - The formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` is derived from the observation that the maximum segment sum can be added `2^k` times, and the original sum of the array is adjusted accordingly.
   - The modulo operation using `func_1` ensures the result is within the required range.

5. **Redundant Function:**
   - `func_3` is not used in the main logic and does not contribute to the solution. However, its presence does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in terms of its main logic and the functions it uses to solve the problem. The redundant function `func_3` does not impact the correctness of the solution.

**Correctness: True**
