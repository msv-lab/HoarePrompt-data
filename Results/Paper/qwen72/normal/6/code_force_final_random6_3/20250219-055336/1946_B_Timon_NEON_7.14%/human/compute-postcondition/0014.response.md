Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is [first element of `arr`, 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1]].**

Explanation:
- `max_segment[0]` is incremented by `arr[i]`.
- Since `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is the first element of `arr`.
- The initial value of `max_segment[0]` is 0 (as `max_segment` is [0, 0]).
- Therefore, `max_segment[0]` becomes the first element of `arr`.
- The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
