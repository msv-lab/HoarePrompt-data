Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is either `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, or remains an empty list if `arr[0]` is negative, `max_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, and `max_sum` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The code `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` updates the first element of `max_segment` by adding the value of `arr[i]` to it.
- Since `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is `arr[0]`.
- The initial value of `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`, so `max_segment[0]` is 0.
- After the update, `max_segment[0]` becomes `0 + arr[0]`, which is `arr[0]`.
- Therefore, `max_segment` is now `[arr[0], 0]`.
- The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `new_segment`, `segments_variants`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged.
