Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[2]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is either [first element of `arr` + `arr[1]` + `arr[2]`, 0] or [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1] or [[arr[0], 0, 0]], and [[first element of `arr` + `arr[1]` + `arr[2]`, 0, 1] or [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0, 1]]. If `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` is [first element of `arr` + `arr[1]` + `arr[2]`, 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1] or [[arr[0], 0, 0]], and `new_segment[0]` is `first element of `arr` + `arr[1]` + `arr[2]`.***
