Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least `len(arr)` elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the last segment of positive integers and its starting index, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of positive integers found and its starting index, `segments_variants` must have at least 2 elements, `segment` is the second element in `segments_variants`, `total_max_segment` is the second element in `segments_variants`.**

The code assigns the value of `segment` (which is the second element in `segments_variants`) to `total_max_segment`. All other variables remain unchanged.
