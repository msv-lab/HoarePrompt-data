Reasoning:

The program aims to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list `p` of best friends.
2. It initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the rest are the elements of `p`.
3. It then iterates through the list `v` from index 1 to `n` and checks if `v[v[i]] == i`. This condition checks if the i-th friend and their best friend (p_i) are each other's best friends, forming a pair.
4. If such a pair is found, the program prints `2` and returns, as sending invitations to both friends in the pair will ensure that both come to the party.
5. If no such pair is found, the program prints `3` and returns.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Initialization of `v`**: The list `v` is initialized twice. The first initialization `v = [0] * (n + 1)` is unnecessary because it is immediately overwritten by `v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`. This does not affect the correctness but is redundant.

2. **Handling of Test Cases**: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It should be structured to process each test case within the loop, but the function `func_1` is called without passing any arguments or context, and it reads input independently for each test case. This can lead to issues if the input is not properly formatted or if the function is called in a different context.

3. **Output for No Pairs**: The program prints `3` if no pair is found. This is not always correct. For example, if `n = 4` and `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`, the program will print `3`, but the correct answer is `2` because sending invitations to friends 1 and 2 will ensure that friends 1 and 2 come to the party (since friend 1's best friend is 2, and friend 2's best friend is 3, who also has an invitation).

To fix these issues, the program should:

- Remove the redundant initialization of `v`.
- Ensure that the function `func_1` is called correctly within the loop for each test case.
- Correctly handle the case where no direct pairs are found but there are other ways to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

Given the current implementation, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all cases correctly, especially when there are no direct pairs but other configurations can still ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

Correctness: **False**
