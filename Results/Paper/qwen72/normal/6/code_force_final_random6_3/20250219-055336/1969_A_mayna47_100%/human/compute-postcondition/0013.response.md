Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \( p_i \) satisfies 1 <= \( p_i \) <= n, \( p_i \) â‰  i, and all \( p_i \) are distinct.
   - `v` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements initialized to the input values.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`. If `v[v[i]]` is equal to `i`, the program returns nothing. Otherwise, the program also returns nothing.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the integer 2.
   - The initial state provides conditions about the variables `t`, `n`, `p`, `v`, and `i`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement in the code snippet.
   - The condition `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i` is given, but it does not influence the `print` statement directly. The program will still execute the `print` statement regardless of this condition.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the integer 2, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `p`, `v`, and `i` as long as the initial state conditions are met.

Output: **2**
