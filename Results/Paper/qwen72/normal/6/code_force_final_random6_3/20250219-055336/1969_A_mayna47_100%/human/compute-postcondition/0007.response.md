Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements initialized to the input values, `i` is 1, and `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`***
