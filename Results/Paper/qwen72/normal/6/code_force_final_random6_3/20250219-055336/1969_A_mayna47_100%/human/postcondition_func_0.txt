The function `func_1` implicitly processes a set of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list `p` of `n` integers where each `p_i` is between 1 and `n`, `p_i` â‰  i, and all `p_i` are distinct. It checks if there exists any index `i` in the range 1 to `n` such that `p[p[i]]` is equal to `i`. If such an index is found, the function prints `2` and returns. If no such index is found, the function prints `3` and returns. The function does not return any value.
