The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.

For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements initialized to the input values, `i` is 2, and `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`**
