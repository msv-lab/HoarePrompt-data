Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider cases where the minimum number of invitations required is not 2 or 3. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
6
2 3 4 5 6 1
```

In this case, the friends form a cycle of length 6, and to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, Monocarp needs to send invitations to 3 friends. However, the program will incorrectly print 3 for this case, even though the minimum number of invitations required is actually 3. The program does not correctly identify the minimum number of invitations needed in all cases, especially when the friends form longer cycles.
