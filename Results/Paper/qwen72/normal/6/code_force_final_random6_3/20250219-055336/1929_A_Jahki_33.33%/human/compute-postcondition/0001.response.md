The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `num2`. For the loop to execute, `num2` must be greater than 1, and `i` should start at 1. The state of `a` and `order` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 <= num2 <= 500, `order` is 0, `i` is 1, `num2` must be greater than 1**
