The value of `order` is incremented by 1. If `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `a[1]`, `order` was initially 1 and is now 2. Otherwise, `order` was initially 0 and is now 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 <= num2 <= 500, `i` is 2, `num2` must be greater than 2, and `order` is now 1 if `a[0]` was less than `a[1]`, otherwise `order` is now 2.**
