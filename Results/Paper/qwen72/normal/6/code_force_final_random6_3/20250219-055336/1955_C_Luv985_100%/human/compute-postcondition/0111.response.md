Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `ans` is updated to 1, 2, or 3, and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` after the update, with `a[l]` being `a[l] - mi` and `a[r]` being `a[r] - mi`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is updated to 1 or 2, `ans` is updated to 1, 2, or 3, and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l-1]` and `a[r]` after the update, with `a[l-1]` being `a[l-1] - mi` and `a[r]` being `a[r] - mi`. If `a[r]` is not 0, then `r` remains `n - 1` or `n - 2` and the values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` are updated as described in the precondition.**
