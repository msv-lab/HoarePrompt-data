Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `n` is the first input value, `k` is the second input value, `a` is the list of integers with the values at indices `l` and `r` updated in each iteration (decreased by `mi`), `l` is the index after the last valid left index where `a[l]` was not zero, `r` is the index before the last valid right index where `a[r]` was not zero. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**
