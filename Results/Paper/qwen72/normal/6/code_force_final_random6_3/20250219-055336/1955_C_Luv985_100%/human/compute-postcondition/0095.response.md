Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `t = k % 2` assigns the remainder of `k` divided by 2 to the variable `t`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Since `k` is a positive integer, `t` will be either 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is even or odd, respectively. The other conditions and variable values from the initial state remain valid.
