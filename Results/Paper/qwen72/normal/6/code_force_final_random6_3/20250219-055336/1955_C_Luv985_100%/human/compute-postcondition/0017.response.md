Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 and decreased by `2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` and `mi` is less than or equal to `k / 2`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `mi`.** 

The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `2 * mi` from it, where `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` and is less than or equal to `k / 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
