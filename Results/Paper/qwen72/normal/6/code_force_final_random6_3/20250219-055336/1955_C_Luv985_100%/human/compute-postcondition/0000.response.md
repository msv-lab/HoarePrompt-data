The provided code snippet is a comment block and does not contain any executable statements that would change the state of the variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.**
