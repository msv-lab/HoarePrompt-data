Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` remains a positive integer decreased by 1, `n` is unchanged, `k` is the remaining value after all possible subtractions of `2 * mi` (where `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` in each iteration), `a` is the list of integers with the values at indices `l` and `r` updated in each iteration (decreased by `mi`), `l` is the index after the last valid left index where `a[l]` was not zero, `r` is the index before the last valid right index where `a[r]` was not zero. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0 or a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= n - 1`, `r` is an integer such that `0 <= r <= n - 1`, `ans` is an integer such that `0 <= ans <= n + 1`, and the elements of `a` between `l` and `r` (inclusive) are non-zero, while elements before `l` and after `r` are zero. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is updated to be within the range `0 <= ans <= n + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `k` is 0 or a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where elements between `l` and `r` (inclusive) are non-zero, while elements before `l` and after `r` are zero, `l` is an integer between 0 and `n - 1`, `r` is an integer between 0 and `n - 1`, `ans` is an integer between 0 and `n - 1`, and `n` is an integer greater than 1. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. If `l` is not equal to `r`, `ans` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
