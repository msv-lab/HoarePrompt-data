Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is updated to 1 or 2, `ans` is updated to 1, 2, 3, or 4, and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l-1]` and `a[r]`, with `a[l-1]` decreased by `mi` and `a[r]` decreased by `mi`.**
