Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `t` is the remainder when `k` is divided by 2. If `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, 1, 2, or 3.***
