Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` after the update, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`.**

Explanation:
- `a[r]` is updated by subtracting `mi` from its current value.
- The value of `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` after the update of `a[l]`.
- All other variables (`T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The updated state of `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`.
