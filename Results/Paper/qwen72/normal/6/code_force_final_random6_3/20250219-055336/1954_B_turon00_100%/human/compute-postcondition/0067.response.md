To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is used as the loop counter and will start from 0 by default in the `range(n)` function. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is equal to `n`**
