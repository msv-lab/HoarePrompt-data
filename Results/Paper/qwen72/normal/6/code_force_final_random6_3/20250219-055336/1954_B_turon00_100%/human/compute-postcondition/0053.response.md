Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 1 or 2 if `a[1]` is equal to `tmp` and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 2 or 3 if `a[1]` is equal to `tmp` and `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0. `ans` is equal to `n` if `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is 0.***
