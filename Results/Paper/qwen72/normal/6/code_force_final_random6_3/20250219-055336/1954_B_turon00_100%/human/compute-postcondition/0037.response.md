The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is used as the loop index and will be set to 0 at the start of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` will be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is equal to `n`**
