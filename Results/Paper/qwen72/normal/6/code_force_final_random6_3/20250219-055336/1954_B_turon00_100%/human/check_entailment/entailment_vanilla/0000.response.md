### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful.
   - A beautiful array is one where we can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \) if \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we are given the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself.
   - The output is the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, or -1 if it is impossible.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It then initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array and `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`.
   - If it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the final `cnt`.
   - If the array length is 1 or `ans` is equal to the array length, it prints -1.
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array length is 1 by printing -1.
   - The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same by printing -1.
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same and can be removed to make the array non-beautiful.
   - However, the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. It only considers the longest sequence of consecutive elements that are the same, but it does not account for the possibility of making the array non-beautiful by removing elements that break the beautiful property.

5. **Flawed Logic:**
   - The program does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will output 1, which is correct.
   - However, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program will output 3, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 2, by removing the first two elements `[3, 3]` or the last two elements `[3, 3]`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases and may produce incorrect results for some inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

**Correctness: False**
