The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `cnt` could be either 0 or 2 based on the initial conditions. Therefore, after the increment, `cnt` will be either 1 or 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is either 1 or 3, `ans` is either `n` or the minimum value between `n` and 0.**
