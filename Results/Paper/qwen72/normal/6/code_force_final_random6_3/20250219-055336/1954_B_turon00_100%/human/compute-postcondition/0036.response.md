Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is equal to `n`.**

The code snippet `ans = n` updates the variable `ans` to be equal to the value of `n`. All other variables and their initial states remain unchanged.
