The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, and `_` will be reassigned to the next value in the range, which is not used in the loop body.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` and is updated to the smaller value between the previous `ans` and the current `cnt`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the postcondition remains as described. If `n` is greater than 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`, the postcondition also remains as described.**
