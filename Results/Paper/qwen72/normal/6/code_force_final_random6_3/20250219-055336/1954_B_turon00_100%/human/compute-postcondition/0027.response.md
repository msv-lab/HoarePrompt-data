Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list.
- `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` and is updated to the smaller value between the previous `ans` and the current `cnt`.
- Additionally, either `n` is 1, or `ans` is equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(-1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
- The value `-1` is a constant integer and will be printed as is.

### Conclusion:
The `print(-1)` statement will print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
