Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0.**

The code snippet `cnt = 0` reassigns the value of `cnt` to 0, but since `cnt` was already 0 in the initial state, the value remains unchanged. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
