To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and expressions in the loop head, which are `i` and the range defined by `1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the loop and will start at 1.
2. **Range Calculation**: The loop will execute if the range is non-empty. The range is defined as `range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1)`, which means the loop will run from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5)` inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 1. This simplifies to `int(x ** 0.5)` being at least 1.

Given that `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `int(x ** 0.5)` will always be at least 1 (since the square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of any integer greater than or equal to 1 will also be at least 1). Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once.

However, we need to adjust the state to reflect the initial conditions of the loop:

- `i` is 1 (the starting value of the loop).
- `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 1, which is always true for the given range of `x`.

So, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to:

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is an empty list, `output2` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
