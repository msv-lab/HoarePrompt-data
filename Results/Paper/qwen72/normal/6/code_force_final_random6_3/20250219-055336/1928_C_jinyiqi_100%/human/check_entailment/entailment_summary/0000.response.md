Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a sequence where the first \(k\) people are numbered from 1 to \(k\), the next \(k-2\) people are numbered from \(k-1\) to 2, and this pattern repeats every \(2k-2\) positions.
   - Given Vasya's position \(n\) and the number \(x\) he received, we need to determine how many different values of \(k\) (where \(k > 1\)) fit the given constraints.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the divisors of \(n + x - 2\) and \(n - x\) using the `func_1` function.
   - It then checks if the divisors, when adjusted by adding 2 and dividing by 2, are valid \(k\) values (i.e., \(k > 1\) and \(k \ge x\)).
   - The program collects all valid \(k\) values, removes duplicates, and prints the count.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1(x)` finds all divisors of \(x\) and returns them in a list.
   - The divisors are split into two lists: `output1` for divisors less than or equal to the square root of \(x\), and `output2` for divisors greater than the square root of \(x\).
   - The divisors in `output1` are reversed and concatenated with `output2` to form the final list of divisors.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic checks if \(n + x - 2\) and \(n - x\) are even.
   - If they are even, it finds the divisors of these values and checks if they can form valid \(k\) values.
   - The valid \(k\) values are collected in the `output` list, duplicates are removed, and the length of the list is printed.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \(n + x - 2\) and \(n - x\).
   - It correctly filters and adjusts these divisors to form valid \(k\) values.
   - The program ensures that \(k > 1\) and \(k \ge x\).
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
