### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem involves a sequence where the first \( k \) people are numbered \( 1, 2, \ldots, k \), followed by the next \( k-2 \) people numbered \( k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \), and this pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - We need to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - If \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \), it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` and processes the result.
     - If \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \), it calls `func_1(n - x)` and processes the result.
   - `func_1` returns all divisors of a given number \( x \) in a specific order.
   - The program then filters the divisors to ensure they are even and greater than or equal to \( x \).
   - Finally, it prints the number of unique valid \( k \) values.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` generates all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in a list.
   - It uses a loop to find divisors up to the square root of \( x \) and appends both the divisor and its corresponding pair.
   - The divisors are then combined and returned in a specific order (greater than the square root followed by less than or equal to the square root in reverse order).

4. **Main Program Analysis:**
   - The main program checks if \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \).
   - For each valid condition, it calls `func_1` and processes the divisors.
   - It appends valid \( k \) values to the `output` list and ensures uniqueness by converting the list to a set.
   - The length of the set is printed, which represents the number of valid \( k \) values.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It filters the divisors to ensure they are even and greater than or equal to \( x \).
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and the logic described. The function `func_1` generates the necessary divisors, and the main program processes them to find valid \( k \) values.

Correctness: **True**
