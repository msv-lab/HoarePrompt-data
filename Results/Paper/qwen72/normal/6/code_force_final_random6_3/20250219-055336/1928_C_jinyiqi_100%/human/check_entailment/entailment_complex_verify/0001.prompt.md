You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:

    #State: `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` is a list containing the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`. The loop variable `i` will be `int(x
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a list that combines `output2` and `output1`. `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reverse order. `output2` contains the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` within the range \(1 \le x \le 10^9\) and returns a list containing all divisors of `x`. The list is composed of two parts: the first part contains all divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`, and the second part contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reverse order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the pattern alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers from 1 to \( k \).

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers \( n \) and \( x \).
   - The output for each test case is the number of different \( k \) that fit the constraints.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - For a given \( n \) and \( x \), \( k \) must be such that \( n \) falls into the correct position in the repeating pattern.
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, so \( n \) must be congruent to a position in the pattern modulo \( 2k - 2 \).

4. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The first \( k \) positions are \( 1, 2, \ldots, k \).
   - The next \( k - 2 \) positions are \( k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \).
   - This pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

5. **Constraints**:
   - \( k \) must be greater than 1.
   - \( n \) and \( x \) must be such that \( n \) can be mapped to \( x \) in the pattern.

6. **Algorithm**:
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to find all divisors of a given number.
   - It then checks if \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even and uses the divisors to find suitable \( k \) values.
   - The suitable \( k \) values are collected in a list `output`, and duplicates are removed using `set`.

7. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function finds all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in a list.
   - It works by iterating from 1 to the square root of \( x \) and checking for divisibility.

8. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks if \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even.
   - If they are even, it finds the divisors of these numbers using `func_1`.
   - It then checks if the divisors plus 2 are even and greater than or equal to \( x \).
   - These values are added to the `output` list and duplicates are removed.

9. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( k = 1 \) is not valid.
   - It also correctly handles the constraints \( 1 \le x < n \le 10^9 \).

10. **Output**:
    - The program prints the length of the `output` list, which represents the number of valid \( k \) values.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid \( k \) values based on the given constraints and the pattern of the settling. The use of divisors and the checks for evenness and the minimum value of \( k \) are appropriate for the problem. The program also handles multiple test cases and edge cases correctly.
