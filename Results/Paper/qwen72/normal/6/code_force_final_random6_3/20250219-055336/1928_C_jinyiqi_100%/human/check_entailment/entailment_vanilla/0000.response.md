### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the pattern alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers from 1 to \( k \).

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers \( n \) and \( x \).
   - The output for each test case is the number of different \( k \) that fit the constraints.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - For a given \( n \) and \( x \), \( k \) must be such that \( n \) falls into the correct position in the repeating pattern.
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, so \( n \) must be congruent to a position in the pattern modulo \( 2k - 2 \).

4. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The first \( k \) positions are \( 1, 2, \ldots, k \).
   - The next \( k - 2 \) positions are \( k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \).
   - This pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

5. **Constraints**:
   - \( k \) must be greater than 1.
   - \( n \) and \( x \) must be such that \( n \) can be mapped to \( x \) in the pattern.

6. **Algorithm**:
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to find all divisors of a given number.
   - It then checks if \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even and uses the divisors to find suitable \( k \) values.
   - The suitable \( k \) values are collected in a list `output`, and duplicates are removed using `set`.

7. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function finds all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in a list.
   - It works by iterating from 1 to the square root of \( x \) and checking for divisibility.

8. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks if \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even.
   - If they are even, it finds the divisors of these numbers using `func_1`.
   - It then checks if the divisors plus 2 are even and greater than or equal to \( x \).
   - These values are added to the `output` list and duplicates are removed.

9. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( k = 1 \) is not valid.
   - It also correctly handles the constraints \( 1 \le x < n \le 10^9 \).

10. **Output**:
    - The program prints the length of the `output` list, which represents the number of valid \( k \) values.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid \( k \) values based on the given constraints and the pattern of the settling. The use of divisors and the checks for evenness and the minimum value of \( k \) are appropriate for the problem. The program also handles multiple test cases and edge cases correctly.
