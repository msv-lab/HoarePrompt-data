Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, reading the integers `n` and `k` for each case. This part is accurate and follows the problem's input format.

2. **Case Handling**:
   - **Case 1: \( k = n \)**: If \( k = n \), it means all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. The function correctly handles this by creating an array of `1`s of length `n` and printing it. This is correct because if all elements are the same, every cyclic shift will be sorted.
   - **Case 2: \( k = 1 \)**: If \( k = 1 \), it means exactly one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. The function creates an array using `range(n)`, which generates a sequence of integers from `0` to `n-1`. This sequence is sorted, and any cyclic shift of this sequence will not be sorted except for the original sequence itself. This is correct.
   - **Case 3: \( k \neq 1 \) and \( k \neq n \)**: If \( k \) is neither 1 nor \( n \), the function prints `-1`. This is based on the reasoning that it is impossible to construct an array where exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted for any \( k \) other than 1 or \( n \). However, this reasoning is incomplete. There are cases where \( k \) can be between 1 and \( n \) and a valid array can still be constructed.

3. **Output**: The function prints the results in the correct format for each test case. For \( k = n \), it prints an array of `1`s. For \( k = 1 \), it prints the sequence generated by `range(n)`. For all other cases, it prints `-1`.

However, the function is incorrect in handling cases where \( 1 < k < n \). For example, consider \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \). A valid array could be `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which has exactly two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 1, 2]` and `[2, 1, 2, 1]`.

### Corrected Function
To handle these cases, we need to construct an array that has exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts. One way to do this is to create an array where the first \( k \) elements are in increasing order and the remaining elements are the same as the first element of the array. This ensures that only the first \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        if k == n:
            res = [1] * n
        elif k == 1:
            res = list(range(1, n + 1))
        elif k > 1 and k < n:
            res = list(range(1, k + 1)) + [1] * (n - k)
        else:
            res = [-1]
        print(*res)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Function
- **Case 1: \( k = n \)**: The function creates an array of `1`s of length `n` and prints it.
- **Case 2: \( k = 1 \)**: The function creates a sequence from `1` to `n` and prints it.
- **Case 3: \( 1 < k < n \)**: The function creates an array where the first \( k \) elements are in increasing order from `1` to `k`, and the remaining \( n - k \) elements are all `1`. This ensures that only the first \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted.
- **Case 4: \( k \) is invalid**: If \( k \) is not between 1 and \( n \), the function prints `-1`.

### Final Evaluation
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because it does not handle cases where \( 1 < k < n \) correctly. The corrected function handles all cases as required by the problem statement.

Final: **False**
