Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `t` must be greater than 1, `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k == n`, a range from 0 to `n-1` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` is a list containing `-1`.**

Explanation:
- If `k == n`, `res` is updated to a list containing `n` ones.
- If `k == 1`, `res` is updated to a range from 0 to `n-1`.
- Otherwise, `res` is updated to a list containing `-1`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and the condition that `t` must be greater than 1 remain unchanged.
