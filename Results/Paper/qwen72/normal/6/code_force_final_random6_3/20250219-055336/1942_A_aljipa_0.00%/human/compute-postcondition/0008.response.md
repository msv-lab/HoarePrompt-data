Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are input integers.
- `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet, it's mentioned as a precondition).
- `res` is a list that is determined based on the values of `n` and `k`:
  - If `k == n`, `res` is a list of `n` ones.
  - If `k == 1`, `res` is a list containing a range from 0 to `n-1`.
  - Otherwise, `res` is a list containing `-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*res)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of the list `res` separated by spaces.

### Possible Cases:
1. **If `k == n`:**
   - `res` will be a list of `n` ones.
   - Example: If `n = 5` and `k = 5`, then `res = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
   - Output: **1 1 1 1 1**

2. **If `k == 1`:**
   - `res` will be a list containing a range from 0 to `n-1`.
   - Example: If `n = 5` and `k = 1`, then `res = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - Output: **0 1 2 3 4**

3. **Otherwise:**
   - `res` will be a list containing `-1`.
   - Example: If `n = 5` and `k = 3`, then `res = [-1]`.
   - Output: **-1**

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the code snippet, the output will depend on the values of `n` and `k`:
- If `k == n`, the output will be a list of `n` ones.
- If `k == 1`, the output will be a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`.
- Otherwise, the output will be a list containing `-1`.

Output: **[1 1 1 ... 1] (if k == n, a list of n ones)**
Output: **[0 1 2 ... n-1] (if k == 1, a list of integers from 0 to n-1)**
Output: **-1 (otherwise, a list containing -1)**

To provide a single, precise output based on the given conditions:
Output: **[1 1 1 ... 1] (if k == n, a list of n ones), [0 1 2 ... n-1] (if k == 1, a list of integers from 0 to n-1), -1 (otherwise, a list containing -1)**
