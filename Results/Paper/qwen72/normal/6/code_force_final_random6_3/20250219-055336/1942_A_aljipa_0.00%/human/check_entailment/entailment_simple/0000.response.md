Reasoning:

The program is attempting to solve the problem by creating an array that meets the specified conditions for `n` and `k`. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Case `k == n`:** 
   - If `k` is equal to `n`, the program creates an array of `n` ones. This is correct because an array of identical elements will have all cyclic shifts sorted, which matches the requirement of having exactly `n` sorted cyclic shifts.

2. **Case `k == 1`:**
   - If `k` is equal to 1, the program creates an array using `range(n)`, which generates a sequence from 0 to `n-1`. This is also correct because the array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself. All other cyclic shifts will not be sorted because they will have a larger number followed by a smaller number.

3. **Case `k != 1` and `k != n`:**
   - In this case, the program outputs `-1`. This is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of other valid arrays that might satisfy the condition for `1 < k < n`.

To correctly handle the case where `1 < k < n`, we need to construct an array such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. One way to achieve this is to create an array where the first `k` elements are in increasing order, and the remaining `n - k` elements are all equal to the last element of the first `k` elements. This ensures that the first `k` cyclic shifts are sorted, and the remaining `n - k` cyclic shifts are not sorted.

For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 3`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3]`. The cyclic shifts are:
- `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3]` (sorted)
- `[2, 3, 3, 3, 1]` (not sorted)
- `[3, 3, 3, 1, 2]` (not sorted)
- `[3, 3, 1, 2, 3]` (not sorted)
- `[3, 1, 2, 3, 3]` (not sorted)

Thus, exactly 3 of the 5 cyclic shifts are sorted.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `1 < k < n`.

Correctness: **False**
