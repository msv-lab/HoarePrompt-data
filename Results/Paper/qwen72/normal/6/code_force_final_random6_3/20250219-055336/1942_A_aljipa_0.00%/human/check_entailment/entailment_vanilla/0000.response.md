Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. This part is correct and follows the problem's input format.

2. **Case Handling**:
   - **Case 1: \( k = n \)**: If \( k = n \), it means all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. The only way this can happen is if all elements in the array are the same. The function correctly handles this by creating an array of `1`s of length `n` and printing it.
   - **Case 2: \( k = 1 \)**: If \( k = 1 \), it means exactly one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. The function creates an array using `range(n)`, which generates a sequence of integers from `0` to `n-1`. This sequence is sorted, and any cyclic shift of this sequence will not be sorted except for the original sequence itself. This is correct.
   - **Case 3: \( k \neq 1 \) and \( k \neq n \)**: If \( k \) is neither 1 nor \( n \), the function prints `-1`. This is because the problem constraints are such that it is impossible to have exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts for any \( k \) other than 1 or \( n \). The reasoning is that:
     - If \( k > 1 \) and \( k < n \), there is no way to construct an array where exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted. This is because if more than one cyclic shift is sorted, all elements must be the same (which would make all shifts sorted, i.e., \( k = n \)), or the array must have a specific pattern that only allows one sorted shift (which would make \( k = 1 \)).

3. **Output**: The function prints the results in the correct format for each test case. For \( k = n \), it prints an array of `1`s. For \( k = 1 \), it prints the sequence generated by `range(n)`. For all other cases, it prints `-1`.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly handles all the specified cases and follows the problem's constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
