The value of `res` is updated based on the conditions provided. If `k == n`, `res` becomes a list of `n` ones. If `k == 1`, `res` becomes a range from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, `res` becomes a list containing `-1`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `t` must be greater than 2, `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k == n`, a range from 0 to `n-1` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` is a list containing `-1`.**
