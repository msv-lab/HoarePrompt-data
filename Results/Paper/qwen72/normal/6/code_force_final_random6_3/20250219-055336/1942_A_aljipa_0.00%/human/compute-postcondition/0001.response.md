The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is used to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` and `k` are parameters where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `t` must be greater than 0**
