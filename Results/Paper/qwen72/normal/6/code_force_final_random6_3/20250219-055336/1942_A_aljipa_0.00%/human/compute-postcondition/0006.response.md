Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `t` must be greater than 1, `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k == n`, a range from 0 to `n-1` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` is a list containing `-1`.** 

The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers provided by the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1. The value of `res` is still determined based on the updated values of `n` and `k`. If `k` is equal to `n`, `res` is a list of `n` ones. If `k` is equal to 1, `res` is a list containing the range from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, `res` is a list containing `-1`.
