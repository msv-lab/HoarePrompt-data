Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is increased by `int(a[0])`**

Explanation:
- The value of `sumo` is incremented by the integer value of `a[0]`.
- The value of `a[0]` was previously updated to `prod // a[0]`, so `sumo` is now increased by this new value.
- The values of `bets` and `i` remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `sumo` and retains the initial conditions for `bets` and `i`.
