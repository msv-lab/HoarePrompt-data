Functionality: ** The function `lcm` accepts a list of integers `l` and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of all the integers in the list. The function does not modify any external variables or states. After the function concludes, the list `l` remains unchanged, and the LCM of the integers in `l` is returned. **
