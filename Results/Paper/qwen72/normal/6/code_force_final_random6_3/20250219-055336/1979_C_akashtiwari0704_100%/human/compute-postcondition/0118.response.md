Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `bets` is an input integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `bets - 1`) is updated to `prod // a[j]`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated list `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the original list `a`, `T` is `t - 1`, and `t` is the number of test cases. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod` for any test case, the output for that test case is `-1`. Otherwise, the output for each test case is a string containing all elements of the updated list `a` separated by spaces, and `sumo` is less than `prod` for that test case.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the variable `bets` is an input integer representing the number of outcomes.
- The list `a` is updated such that each element `a[j]` (for `j` ranging from `0` to `bets - 1`) is set to `prod // a[j]`, where `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the original elements in `a`.
- The variable `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated list `a`.
- The variable `T` is incremented from `0` to `t - 1` as the loop progresses.
- If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod` for any test case, the output for that test case is `-1`.
- Otherwise, the output for each test case is a string containing the updated elements of `a` separated by spaces, and `sumo` is less than `prod` for that test case.
- After all iterations, `T` will be equal to `t - 1`, and the loop will have processed all `t` test cases.
