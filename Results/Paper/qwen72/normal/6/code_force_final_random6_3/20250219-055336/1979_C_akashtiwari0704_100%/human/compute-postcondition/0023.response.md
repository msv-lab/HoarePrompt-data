The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `bets`. At the end of the last iteration, `bets` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to continue, `bets` must be greater than 2.

State: **`bets` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is increased by `int(a[0])` + `int(a[1])`, `a[1]` is updated to `prod // a[1]`**
