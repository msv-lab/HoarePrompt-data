Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `bets` is an input integer greater than 0.
2. `i` is `bets - 1`.
3. `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `bets - 1`) is updated to `prod // a[j]`.
4. `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated list `a`.
5. `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the original list `a`.
6. `ans` is a string containing all elements of the updated list `a` separated by spaces.
7. `T` is `T + 1`.
8. `t` must be greater than `T + 1`.
9. `sumo` is less than `prod`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input and Initialization:**
   - `bets` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is set to `bets - 1`.

2. **List `a` and LCM Calculation:**
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the original list `a`.

3. **List Update:**
   - Each element `a[j]` in the list `a` is updated to `prod // a[j]`.
   - This means each element in `a` is replaced by the integer division of `prod` by the original value of `a[j]`.

4. **Sum Calculation:**
   - `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated list `a`.

5. **String Construction:**
   - `ans` is a string containing all elements of the updated list `a` separated by spaces.

6. **Conditions:**
   - `T` is incremented by 1.
   - `t` must be greater than `T + 1`.
   - `sumo` is less than `prod`.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the string `ans`, which contains all elements of the updated list `a` separated by spaces. Each element in the updated list `a` is the result of `prod // a[j]` for the original elements `a[j]` in the list `a`.

Since the exact values of the original list `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the updated list. However, we know the structure and the transformation applied to each element.

Output: **[a[0] // prod] [a[1] // prod] ... [a[bets-1] // prod] (where each element is the result of prod // a[j] for the original elements a[j] in the list a)**

This output describes the elements of the updated list `a` as they will appear in the string `ans`. Each element is the integer division of `prod` by the corresponding original element in `a`.
