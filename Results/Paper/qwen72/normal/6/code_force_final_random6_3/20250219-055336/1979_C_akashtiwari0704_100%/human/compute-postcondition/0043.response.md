Output State: **`bets` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `bets - 1`, each element in `a` is updated to `prod // a[i]` where `i` ranges from 0 to `bets - 1`, if `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`. Otherwise, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `bets` is greater than 0, and `ans` is a string containing the values of `str(a[0])`, `str(a[1])`, ..., `str(a[bets-1])` each followed by a space. `l` must have at least one element, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])` where `i` is `bets - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])` where `i` is `bets - 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
