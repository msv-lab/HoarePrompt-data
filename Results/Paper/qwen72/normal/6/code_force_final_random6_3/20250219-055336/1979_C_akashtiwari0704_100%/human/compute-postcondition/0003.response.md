The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `l`. If the list `l` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variables `t`, `T`, and `g` are not part of the loop head, so they cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

For the loop to execute, the list `l` must have at least one element, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is 1, `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0**
