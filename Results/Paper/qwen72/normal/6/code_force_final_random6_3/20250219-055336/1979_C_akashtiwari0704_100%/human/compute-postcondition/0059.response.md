The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `bets`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `bets`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `bets` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `bets` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`bets` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is `int(a[0])`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `str(a[0])`, `str(a[1])`, ..., `str(a[bets-1])` each followed by a space.**
