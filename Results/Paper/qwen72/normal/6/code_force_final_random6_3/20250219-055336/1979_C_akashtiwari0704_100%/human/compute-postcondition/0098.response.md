The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `bets`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `bets` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `bets` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is `prod // a[0]`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`, `ans` is no longer valid, `T` is `T + 1`, `t` must be greater than `T + 1`**
