Postcondition: **`N` is an input integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 50), `vals` is a list of N integers where each integer `k_i` satisfies (2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20), `den` is the result of `den - sum(vprod)`, `vprod` is a list of N integers where each element is `(den // r)` for each `r` in `vals`, and `den` is greater than 0.**
