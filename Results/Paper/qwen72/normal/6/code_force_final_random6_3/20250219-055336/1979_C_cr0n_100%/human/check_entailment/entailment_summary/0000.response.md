Reasoning:

The problem requires us to distribute coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome. This means that for each outcome \(i\), the bet \(x_i\) should satisfy the condition:
\[ k_i \cdot x_i > \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j \]

To achieve this, the program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \(k_i\) to ensure that the bets are distributed in a way that meets the condition. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers \(a\) and \(b\). It is used to find the LCM of all the multipliers in the list `vals`.

2. **func_2()**:
   - It reads the number of outcomes \(N\) and the list of multipliers `vals`.
   - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier in `vals`.
   - It iterates through the list `vals` and updates `den` to be the LCM of `den` and the current multiplier \(x\). This ensures that `den` is the LCM of all multipliers.
   - It then calculates a list `vprod` where each element is the integer division of `den` by the corresponding multiplier in `vals`. This list represents the bets on each outcome.
   - It computes the total sum of the bets and subtracts it from `den` to get the final value of `den`.
   - If the final value of `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to meet the condition.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string, which represents a valid distribution of bets.

The logic of the program is sound and aligns with the problem requirements. The use of the LCM ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This is because the LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets are proportional to the multipliers, and the condition \( k_i \cdot x_i > \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j \) is met for each \(i\).

Therefore, the program is correct.
