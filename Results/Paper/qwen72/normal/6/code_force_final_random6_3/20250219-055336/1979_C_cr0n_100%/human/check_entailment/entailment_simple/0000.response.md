### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires distributing coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, the amount received back is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on outcome `i`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using the `func_2` function.
   - `func_2` reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
   - It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers `vals` using the `func_1` function.
   - It then calculates the bets `vprod` as `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(vprod)`.
   - The program checks if `den - sum(vprod) > 0`. If this condition is not met, it prints `-1` and returns.
   - If the condition is met, it prints the bets `vprod` as a space-separated string.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers `vals` ensures that the bets `vprod` are integers and are the smallest possible values that satisfy the condition `k_i * x_i` for each `i`.
   - The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - If `den - sum(vprod) <= 0`, it means there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total amount bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, and the program correctly prints `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no valid distribution is possible by printing `-1`.
   - The program ensures that the bets are within the constraints (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) by using the LCM and integer division.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of coins or determine that no such distribution exists.
   - The program's approach is mathematically sound and follows the problem's requirements.
