Output State: **`N` is an input integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 50), `vals` is a list of N integers where each integer `k_i` satisfies (2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20), `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)`, `x` is the second integer in the list `vals`, and `vals` must have at least 2 elements.**

In natural language: The value of `den` is updated to the result of the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `den` and `x`, where `x` is the second integer in the list `vals`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
