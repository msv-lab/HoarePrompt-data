Output State: **`N` is an input integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 50), `vals` is a list of N integers where each integer `k_i` satisfies (2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20), `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)`, `x` is the third integer in the list `vals`, and `vals` must have at least 3 elements.**

Explanation: The code snippet `den = func_1(den, x)` updates the value of `den` by calling the function `func_1` with `den` and `x` as arguments. The value of `x` is the third integer in the list `vals`. The other variables (`N` and `vals`) remain unchanged. The new value of `den` is the result of the function `func_1(den, x)`.
