You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 50), and vals is a list of N integers where each integer k_i satisfies (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20).
def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
        
    #State: `N` is an input integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 50), `vals` is a list of N integers where each integer `k_i` satisfies (2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20), `den` is the result of applying `func_1` to the initial `den` and all elements in `vals` sequentially, and `vals` has exactly N elements.
    vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns without any specific value.
    #State: `N` is an input integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 50), `vals` is a list of N integers where each integer `k_i` satisfies (2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20), `den` is the result of `den - sum(vprod)`, `vprod` is a list of N integers where each element is `(den // r)` for each `r` in `vals`, and `den` is greater than 0.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: - The `print` statement will output the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string.
    #   - Each element in `vprod` is the integer division of `den` by the corresponding element in `vals`.
    #
    #Given the initial state and the code, the output will be a space-separated string of the integer divisions of `den` by each element in `vals`.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates with an implied input of a positive integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 50) and a list `vals` of `N` integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20). It performs some operations and returns without any specific value.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns without any specific value.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
