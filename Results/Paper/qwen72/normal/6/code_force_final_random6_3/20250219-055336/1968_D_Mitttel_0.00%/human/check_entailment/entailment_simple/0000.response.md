Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and initializes an index to keep track of the current position in the input list.
   - For each test case, it parses `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` from the input list and calls `func_1` with these parameters.
   - The results of each test case are collected in a list `results` and printed at the end.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - The function `calculate_score` is responsible for calculating the score for a player starting at a given position.
   - It initializes `score` to 0, `current_pos` to the starting position, and `steps` to 0.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles in the permutation.
   - For each step up to `k`, it increments the score by the value at the current position in the array `a` and moves to the next position in the permutation `p`.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the cycle length and cycle score.
   - It then calculates the number of full cycles and the remaining steps, updating the score accordingly.
   - Finally, it returns the total score.

3. **Game Outcome Determination**:
   - The function `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares the scores and returns the appropriate result: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".

4. **Cycle Detection and Handling**:
   - The cycle detection logic in `calculate_score` is sound. It correctly identifies cycles and calculates the score for the remaining steps using the cycle length and cycle score.
   - The logic for handling the remaining steps after full cycles is also correct.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the permutation is a single element or where the starting positions are the same.

6. **Performance**:
   - The program efficiently handles the constraints, especially the large values of `k` and the large number of test cases.
   - The use of a dictionary to detect cycles ensures that the program does not get stuck in infinite loops.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" problem and should produce the correct output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
