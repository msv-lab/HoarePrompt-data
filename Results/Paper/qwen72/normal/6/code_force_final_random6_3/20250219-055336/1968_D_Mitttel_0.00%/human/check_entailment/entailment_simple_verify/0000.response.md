Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The `func_2` function reads the input correctly and processes multiple test cases. It correctly parses the input into the required variables `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` for each test case. This part of the program is well-implemented and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Score Calculation**: The `calculate_score` function is designed to compute the score for a given starting position. It correctly handles the following:
   - **Initial Score Calculation**: It starts with a score of 0 and iterates through the steps, adding the value of `a[current_pos - 1]` to the score.
   - **Cycle Detection**: It uses a dictionary `visited` to track the positions visited and detects cycles by checking if the current position has been visited before.
   - **Cycle Handling**: If a cycle is detected, it calculates the cycle length and cycle score. It then updates the score by adding the cycle score for the full cycles and the remaining steps outside the cycle. This ensures that the score is computed accurately even if the game lasts longer than the cycle length.

3. **Winner Determination**: The `func_1` function compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and returns the appropriate result. The logic is straightforward and correct:
   - If Bodya's score is greater, it returns 'Bodya'.
   - If Sasha's score is greater, it returns 'Sasha'.
   - If the scores are equal, it returns 'Draw'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the game duration `k` is 1.
   - It also handles the case where the starting positions are the same.
   - The program correctly handles cycles and ensures that the score is computed accurately even if the game duration is very large (up to \(10^9\)).

5. **Performance**:
   - The program is efficient in terms of time complexity. The `calculate_score` function runs in \(O(n)\) time in the worst case, which is acceptable given the constraints.
   - The use of a dictionary for cycle detection ensures that the program can handle large inputs efficiently.

6. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations provided for each function accurately describe the state of the program at key points. They confirm that the program follows the correct logic and handles the game mechanics as described in the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and handles all aspects of the problem as specified. The original assessment of **True** is accurate.

Final: **True**
