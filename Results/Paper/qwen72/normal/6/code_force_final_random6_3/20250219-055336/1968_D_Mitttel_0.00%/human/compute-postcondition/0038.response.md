Output State: **`index` is 13 + 5 * `n`, `input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the most recent `result`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4 - n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3 - n]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2 - n]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1 - n]`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[index - n:index]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `t` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` updates the variable `a` to be a list of integers from the slice of `data` starting at `index` and containing `n` elements.
- The previous value of `a` (which was a list of integers from `data[index - 4 - n:index - 4]`) is replaced by the new list of integers.
- All other variables (`index`, `input`, `data`, `t`, `results`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `result`) remain unchanged.
