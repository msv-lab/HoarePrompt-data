Output State: **`input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `index` is 1 + 4 * `t` + 2 * `n` * `t`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration, `n` is the integer value of `data[1 + 4 * (t-1)]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2 + 4 * (t-1)]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3 + 4 * (t-1)]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4 + 4 * (t-1)]`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[5 + 4 * (t-1) + 2 * n * (t-1):5 + 4 * (t-1) + 2 * n * (t-1) + n]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[5 + 4 * (t-1) + 2 * n * (t-1) + n:5 + 4 * (t-1) + 2 * n * (t-1) + 2 * n]`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The `input` variable remains a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`.
- The `data` list remains unchanged and still contains the original split input.
- The `index` variable has advanced to the position `1 + 4 * t + 2 * n * t`, where `t` is the initial number of iterations and `n` is the number of elements processed in each iteration.
- The `t` variable is now 0, indicating that all iterations have been completed.
- The `results` list contains the values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration of the loop.
- The variables `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are set to the values from the last iteration of the loop, where `n` is the integer value of the element at position `1 + 4 * (t-1)` in `data`, `k` is the integer value of the element at position `2 + 4 * (t-1)`, `PB` is the integer value of the element at position `3 + 4 * (t-1)`, `PS` is the integer value of the element at position `4 + 4 * (t-1)`, `p` is a list of integers from the segment of `data` starting at position `5 + 4 * (t-1) + 2 * n * (t-1)` and ending at `5 + 4 * (t-1) + 2 * n * (t-1) + n`, and `a` is a list of integers from the segment of `data` starting at position `5 + 4 * (t-1) + 2 * n * (t-1) + n` and ending at `5 + 4 * (t-1) + 2 * n * (t-1) + 2 * n`.
