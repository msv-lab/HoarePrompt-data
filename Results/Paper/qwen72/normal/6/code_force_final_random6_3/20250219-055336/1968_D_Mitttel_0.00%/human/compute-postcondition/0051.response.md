Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple sets of parameters, and calls `func_1` for each set. It then prints the results of these calls. After the function concludes, the input is consumed, and the results of the `func_1` calls are printed to the standard output. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. **
