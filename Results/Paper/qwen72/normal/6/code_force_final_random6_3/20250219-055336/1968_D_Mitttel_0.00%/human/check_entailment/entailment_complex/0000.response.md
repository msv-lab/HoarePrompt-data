Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game based on the scores calculated by `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It correctly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha by calling `calculate_score` with their respective starting positions.
   - The logic for comparing the scores and returning the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') is correct.

2. **Function 2 (calculate_score)**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position in the permutation `p` and the array `a` for `k` turns.
   - It correctly handles the movement of the player through the permutation and the addition of scores.
   - The function also correctly detects cycles in the permutation and calculates the score for the remaining steps after the cycle is detected.
   - The cycle detection and score calculation logic is sound and follows the problem description.

3. **Function 3 (func_2)**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to handle multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case, storing the results in a list.
   - The results are then printed one by one, which matches the expected output format.

4. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input handling in `func_2` is correct and follows the problem's constraints.
   - The output is correctly formatted and matches the expected output for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The functions handle edge cases such as when `k` is very large and when cycles are detected in the permutation.
   - The cycle detection logic ensures that the score calculation is efficient even for large `k`.

6. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the program is consistent with the problem description.
   - Each function performs its intended task correctly, and the program as a whole meets the requirements of the problem.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
