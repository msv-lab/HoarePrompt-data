You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #The program returns the final value of `score` after processing the steps and cycles as described. If a cycle is detected, `score` is updated by adding the product of `full_cycles` and `cycle_score`, and the sum of the values in `a` at the positions corresponding to the first `remainder_steps` iterations. If no cycle is detected, the program returns the original value of `score`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `calculate_score` accepts a single parameter `start_pos`, which is a positive integer within the range 1 to `n`. It returns an integer `score` which represents the sum of elements from the list `a` at positions determined by following a permutation `p` for `k` steps. If a cycle is detected within the permutation, the function calculates the total score by considering the length of the cycle and the remaining steps, ensuring that the score is updated correctly for the full cycles and the remaining steps outside the cycle. If no cycle is detected, the function simply returns the score after `k` steps. The function does not modify the input lists `a` or `p`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the game mechanics, including the detection of cycles in the permutation and the calculation of scores for both players. The `calculate_score` function ensures that the score is computed accurately by following the rules of the game, and the `func_1` function compares the scores to determine the winner. The `func_2` function reads the input and processes multiple test cases, which is consistent with the problem's input and output requirements. The program appears to handle all edge cases and potential inputs correctly, making it a correct solution.
