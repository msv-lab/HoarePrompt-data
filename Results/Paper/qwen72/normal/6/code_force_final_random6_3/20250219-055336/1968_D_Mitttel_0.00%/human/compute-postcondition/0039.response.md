Output State: **`index` is 13 + 6 * `n`, `input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the most recent `result`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4 - n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3 - n]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2 - n]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1 - n]`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[index - n:index]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `t` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by `n`, so the new value of `index` is `13 + 5 * n + n`, which simplifies to `13 + 6 * n`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
