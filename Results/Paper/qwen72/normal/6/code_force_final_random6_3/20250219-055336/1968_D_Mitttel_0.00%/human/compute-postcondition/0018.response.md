The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` is decreased by 1, so `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **`input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `index` is 5 + 2 * `n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[5:5 + n]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[5 + n:5 + 2*n]`**

Note: The state of `t` is adjusted to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, but the exact value of `t` is not specified, only that it must be greater than 0.
