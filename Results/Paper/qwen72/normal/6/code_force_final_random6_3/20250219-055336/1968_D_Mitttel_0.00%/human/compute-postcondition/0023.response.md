Output State: **`input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `index` is 9 + 2 * `n` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`), `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2 * n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[5:5 + n]` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`), `a` is a list of integers from `data[5 + n:5 + 2 * n]` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`).**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by 4, so the new value of `index` is `5 + 2 * n + 4`, which simplifies to `9 + 2 * n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
