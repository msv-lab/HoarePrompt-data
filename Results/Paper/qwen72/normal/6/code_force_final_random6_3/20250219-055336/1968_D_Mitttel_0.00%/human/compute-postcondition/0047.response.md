The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 2 elements, and `result` is the second element in the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least 3 elements, and `result` will be the third element in the `results` list.

State: **`results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration and must have at least three elements, `result` is the third element in the `results` list**
