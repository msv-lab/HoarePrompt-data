To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration.
   - `results` must have at least one element.
   - `result` is the first element in the `results` list.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the value of `result`.

3. **Explanation**:
   - Since `results` is a list that contains values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration, and it is guaranteed to have at least one element, `result` will be the value of the first element in this list.
   - The exact value of `result` depends on the output of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for the first iteration. Without the specific implementation of `func_1`, we can only describe `result` as the first element of the `results` list.

Therefore, the output of the `print(result)` statement will be the value of the first element in the `results` list.

Output: **result (where result is the first element in the `results` list, which is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for the first iteration)**
