Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration.
   - The list `results` must have at least two elements.
   - `result` is the second element in the `results` list.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Determine the Output**:
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the value of the second element in the `results` list.
   - Since `results` is a list of values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, the second element in this list is the result of the second call to `func_1`.

4. **Explanation**:
   - The exact value of `result` depends on the parameters passed to `func_1` during the second iteration.
   - Without the specific parameters and the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `result`.
   - However, we know that `result` is the value returned by `func_1` during the second iteration.

Output: **result (where result is the value returned by `func_1` during the second iteration)**
