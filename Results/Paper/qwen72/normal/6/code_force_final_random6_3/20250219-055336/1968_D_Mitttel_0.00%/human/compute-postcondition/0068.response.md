The function `calculate_score` accepts a parameter `start_pos`. `start_pos` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= `n`, where `n` is the length of the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

- **Case_1**: If `start_pos` is within the valid range (1 to `n`), the function returns the value of `score`, which is `a[current_pos - 1]`, where `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`.
- **Case_2**: If `start_pos` is within the valid range, the function returns the value of `score`, which is the sum of the elements at the positions `current_pos - 1` in the list `a`, added together twice. `current_pos` is equal to `p[start_pos - 1]`.
- **Case_3**: If `start_pos` is within the valid range, the function returns the value of `score`, which is the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` added to itself three times. `current_pos` is determined by the value of `p[p[start_pos - 1] - 1]`.
- **Case_4**: If `start_pos` is within the valid range, the function returns the final value of `score` after processing the steps and cycles as described. If a cycle is detected, `score` is updated by adding the product of `full_cycles` and `cycle_score`, and the sum of the values in `a` at the positions corresponding to the first `remainder_steps` iterations. If no cycle is detected, the function returns the original value of `score`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `start_pos`, a positive integer within the range 1 to `n`. It returns the value of `score` based on the following cases: If `start_pos` is valid, it can return the value at `a[start_pos - 1]`, the sum of the value at `a[p[start_pos - 1] - 1]` added twice, the sum of the value at `a[p[p[start_pos - 1] - 1] - 1]` added three times, or the final `score` after processing cycles and steps.**
