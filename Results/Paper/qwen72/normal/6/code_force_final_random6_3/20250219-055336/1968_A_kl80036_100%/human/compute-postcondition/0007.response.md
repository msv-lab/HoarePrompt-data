Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
- `i` is 1.
- `y` is calculated as `x - 1`.

When the `print(y)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`.

Since `x` is an input integer within the range 2 to 1000, the value of `y` will be one less than the value of `x`.

Output: **y (where y is x - 1 and x is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive)**
