### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is the largest integer that divides both \( x \) and \( y \) without leaving a remainder.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It then sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \).
   - Finally, it prints \( y \).

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The program always sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \).
   - We need to verify if \( y = x - 1 \) maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

4. **GCD Analysis:**
   - The GCD of \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) is always 1 because \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) are consecutive integers, and consecutive integers are coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1).
   - Therefore, \( \gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x \).

5. **Maximizing the Expression:**
   - For any \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \), the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) will be at most \( x \) because \( \gcd(x, y) \) is at most \( y \), and the maximum value of \( y \) is \( x - 1 \).
   - Hence, \( y = x - 1 \) indeed maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly finds and prints \( y = x - 1 \) for each test case, which satisfies the problem's requirement.
