### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that the sum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The given program always sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \) and prints it. Let's analyze if this approach is correct:

1. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) is always 1. This is because \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) are consecutive integers, and the only common divisor they can have is 1.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) becomes \( 1 + (x - 1) = x \).

3. **Maximization**:
   - For any \( y \) in the range \( 1 \le y < x \), the sum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) will be maximized when \( y \) is as large as possible. Since \( y = x - 1 \) is the largest possible value for \( y \) in this range, the sum \( 1 + (x - 1) = x \) is indeed the maximum possible sum.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs \( y = x - 1 \) for each test case, which is correct according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly finds and prints \( y = x - 1 \) for each test case, which is the correct solution to maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
