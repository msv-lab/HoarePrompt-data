Output State: **`x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `y` is `x - 1`**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to a new input integer, but the constraint that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 still holds. The value of `i` remains 1, and `y` is updated to be `x - 1`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `x` and the updated value of `y` based on the new `x`.
