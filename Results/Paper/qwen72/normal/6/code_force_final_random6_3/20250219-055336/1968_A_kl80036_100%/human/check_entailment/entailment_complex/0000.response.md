Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The program provided always sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \) and prints it. Let's analyze why this approach is correct:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) is always 1, because \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) are consecutive integers, and consecutive integers are coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1).

2. **Expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \)**: Given that \( \gcd(x, x-1) = 1 \), the expression \( \gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) \) simplifies to \( 1 + (x-1) = x \).

3. **Maximizing the Expression**: For any \( y \) in the range \( 1 \le y < x \), the value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) will always be less than or equal to \( x \). This is because \( \gcd(x, y) \) is at most \( y \), and thus \( \gcd(x, y) + y \le y + y = 2y \). Since \( y < x \), \( 2y < 2x \), and the maximum value \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) can achieve is \( x \), which is exactly what happens when \( y = x - 1 \).

4. **Multiple Solutions**: The problem statement allows for any \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Since \( y = x - 1 \) always achieves the maximum value \( x \), it is a valid solution.

Therefore, the program correctly finds and prints \( y = x - 1 \) for each test case, which satisfies the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
