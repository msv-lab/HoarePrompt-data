Output State: **`x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, `y` is `x - 1`**

Explanation: The code snippet `x = int(input())` reassigns the value of `x` to a new input integer, but the constraint that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 remains valid. The values of `i` and `y` are not affected by this code, so they retain their initial values. `y` is still `x - 1`, reflecting the updated value of `x`.
