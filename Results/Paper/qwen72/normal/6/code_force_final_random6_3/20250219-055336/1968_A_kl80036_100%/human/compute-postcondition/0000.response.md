The loop head involves the variables `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input provided must be a positive integer greater than 0, because `range(n)` will generate a sequence from 0 to n-1, and if n is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state specifies that the function should take an integer `x` as input where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, we need to ensure that the input to the loop is within this range. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is within the specified range for `x`.

State: **`x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, the input to the loop must be an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000**
