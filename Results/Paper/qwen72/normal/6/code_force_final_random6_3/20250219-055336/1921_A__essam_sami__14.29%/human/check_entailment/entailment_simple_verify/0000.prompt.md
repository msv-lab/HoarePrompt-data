You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates are within the range -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and the square has a positive area with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `steps` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are the last set of integers provided by the user, `n` is equal to (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f), `x` is equal to (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h). If `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in every potential case. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the side length of the square. The program calculates the distances between two pairs of points and assumes that the smaller of these distances is the side length of the square. However, this approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the points used to calculate the distances are actually adjacent corners of the square.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
0 0
0 2
2 0
2 2
```
The program will calculate:
- `n = (0 - 2) * (0 - 2) + (0 - 0) * (0 - 0) = 4`
- `x = (0 - 2) * (0 - 2) + (2 - 2) * (2 - 2) = 4`

Since both `n` and `x` are equal, the program will print `4`, which is incorrect. The correct area of the square is `4` (side length `2`), but the program does not consistently identify the correct side length.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should identify the unique x-coordinates and y-coordinates, and then calculate the side length as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates), and finally compute the area.
