The only objects in the loop head are variables `steps` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is assigned the value of an input integer, which is within the range 1 <= t <= 100. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1, and `steps` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `steps` is 0**
