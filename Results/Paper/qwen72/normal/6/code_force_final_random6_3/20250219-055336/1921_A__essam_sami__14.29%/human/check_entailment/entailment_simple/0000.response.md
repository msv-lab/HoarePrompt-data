### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of the square.

2. **Coordinate Calculation**: The program calculates two values, `n` and `x`, which are the squared distances between two pairs of points. Specifically, `n` is the squared distance between the points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`, and `x` is the squared distance between the points `(c, d)` and `(g, h)`.

3. **Area Calculation**: The program then compares `x` and `n` and prints the smaller of the two values. This approach is incorrect because the area of the square is not necessarily the smaller of the two squared distances. The correct approach should be to find the side length of the square and then square it to get the area.

4. **Square Properties**: Since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by finding the difference in the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners. For example, if `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` are two adjacent corners, the side length is either `|a - c|` or `|b - d|`.

5. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle the edge case where the points are not in the correct order. It assumes that the points are given in a specific order, which is not guaranteed by the problem statement. The correct approach should be to sort the points or use a more robust method to determine the side length.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. It uses a flawed approach by comparing two squared distances and printing the smaller one, which does not necessarily give the correct side length of the square. The correct approach should involve finding the side length of the square by determining the difference in the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners and then squaring that difference to get the area.
