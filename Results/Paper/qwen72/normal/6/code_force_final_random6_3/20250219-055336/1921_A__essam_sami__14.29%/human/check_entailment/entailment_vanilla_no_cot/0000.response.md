Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the area of the square. The program calculates the squared distances between two pairs of points and then prints the smaller of the two. However, this approach does not guarantee that the calculated distance is the side length of the square, especially since the points are given in a random order.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to identify the side length of the square by finding the minimum difference between the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the given points. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract all x and y coordinates
        x_coords = [point[0] for point in points]
        y_coords = [point[1] for point in points]
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = min(max(x_coords) - min(x_coords), max(y_coords) - min(y_coords))
        
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)

# Example usage
func()
```

This program correctly identifies the side length of the square by finding the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates, and then calculates the area of the square.
