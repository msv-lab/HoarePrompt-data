Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same. For example, consider the following input:

```
2
5
5 5 5 5 5
```

For this input, the program will output:

```
-1
```

However, a valid solution exists. For instance, betting 1 coin on each outcome would result in a total bet of 5 coins. If any outcome wins, you would receive back \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) coins, which is not strictly greater than the total bet of 5 coins. Therefore, the correct output should be a valid distribution of coins, such as:

```
1 1 1 1 1
```

The program fails to find a valid solution in this case, leading to an incorrect output.
