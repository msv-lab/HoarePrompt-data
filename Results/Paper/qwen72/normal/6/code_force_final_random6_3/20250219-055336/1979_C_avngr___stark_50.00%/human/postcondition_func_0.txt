The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `numbers` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the original input variables `t`, `n`, and `k` (if they exist) remaining unchanged, and the function having computed and returned the GCD of the `numbers` list.
