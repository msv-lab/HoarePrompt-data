### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to bet coins on `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the `i`-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the `i`-th outcome.
   - We need to find a set of bets `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` such that the sum of all bets is less than the minimum of `k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program calculates the product of all `k_i` values, which is `m`.
   - It then calculates the bets `c[i]` as `m / k[i]` for each outcome.
   - The program finds the highest common factor (HCF) of the bets `c` using the `func_1` function.
   - It scales down the bets by dividing each `c[i]` by the HCF.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the scaled bets is less than `m / hcf`. If it is, the bets are valid; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The product `m` of all `k_i` values is a common multiple of all `k_i`.
   - By setting `c[i] = m / k[i]`, we ensure that `k_i * c[i] = m` for each `i`.
   - The HCF of the `c` values is used to scale down the bets to the smallest possible values that still satisfy the condition `k_i * c[i] = m`.
   - If the sum of the scaled bets is less than `m / hcf`, then the bets are valid because the total amount bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - If the sum of the scaled bets is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`, then no valid solution exists, and the program correctly prints `-1`.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program should handle the case where `n = 1` separately, as the product `m` would be `k[0]` and the bet `c[0]` would be `1`, which would always be valid.
   - The program should also handle the case where all `k_i` values are the same. In such cases, the sum of the bets will be `n * (m / k[0])`, which is always greater than or equal to `m / k[0]` if `n > 1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - For `n = 1`, the program will correctly output a valid bet.
   - For `n > 1` and all `k_i` values being the same, the program will correctly output `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation for the given problem. It correctly handles the constraints and edge cases.

**Correctness: True**
