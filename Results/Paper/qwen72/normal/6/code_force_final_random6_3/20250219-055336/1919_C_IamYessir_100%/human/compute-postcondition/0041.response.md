Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a non-empty list containing `lit[i]`, `x` is less than `lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, and `x` is less than `y`. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `y`, and `lit[i]` remain as they were, with `x` being less than `y` and `lit[i]` being between `x` and `y` (inclusive).***
