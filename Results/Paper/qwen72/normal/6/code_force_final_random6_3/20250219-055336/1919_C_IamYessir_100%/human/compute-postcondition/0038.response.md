Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. If `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than `y`. `x` is less than `lit[i]`. `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`.**
