Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is `i + 1`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `y` is `float('inf')`, if `len(a) == 0`, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`.** 

The value of `y` is now `float('inf')`, and the other variables retain their previous values or conditions. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`.
