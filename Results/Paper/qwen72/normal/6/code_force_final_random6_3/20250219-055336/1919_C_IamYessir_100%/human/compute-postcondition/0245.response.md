Output State: **`a` is not an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `x` is the last element of `a`.**

The code snippet `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
