### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `lit` itself.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function initializes two empty lists `a` and `b` to store the subsequences.
   - It also initializes a variable `cp` to 0, which is not used in the function and can be considered redundant.

3. **Subsequence Splitting Logic:**
   - The function iterates through each element of `lit` and decides whether to append it to `a` or `b` based on the current last elements of `a` and `b`.
   - The conditions for appending elements to `a` or `b` are:
     - If `x > y` (where `x` is the last element of `a` and `y` is the last element of `b`):
       - If `y >= lit[i]`, append `lit[i]` to `b`.
       - If `lit[i] > x`, append `lit[i]` to `b`.
       - If `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, append `lit[i]` to `a`.
     - If `x == y`:
       - Append `lit[i]` to `a`.
     - If `x < y`:
       - If `x >= lit[i]`, append `lit[i]` to `a`.
       - If `lit[i] > y`, append `lit[i]` to `a`.
       - If `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, append `lit[i]` to `b`.

4. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the penalty for `a` and `b` by counting the number of indices where the current element is greater than the previous element.
   - It sums these penalties and prints the result.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `a` or `b` is empty by using `float('inf')` to ensure that the comparison logic works correctly.
   - It correctly handles the case where all elements in `a` or `b` are the same, resulting in a penalty of 0.

6. **Optimality:**
   - The logic for splitting the array into `a` and `b` is designed to minimize the penalty. However, the conditions for appending elements to `a` or `b` are complex and may not always result in the optimal split.
   - The function does not consider all possible splits, but rather follows a specific greedy approach. This approach may not always yield the minimum possible penalty.

### Correctness:
- The function's logic for splitting the array and calculating the penalty is not optimal. The conditions for appending elements to `a` or `b` are overly complex and may not always result in the minimum penalty.
- For example, in the first test case, the function might not always split the array in a way that minimizes the penalty. The optimal split should be such that the penalty is minimized, but the function's logic does not guarantee this.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
