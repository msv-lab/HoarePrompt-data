Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is `i + 1`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `y` retains its original value or is set to `float('inf')` if `len(b) == 0`, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is `float('inf')`. If `len(a) > 0`, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `x > y` and `y >= lit[i]`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`. If `x > y` and `y < lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`. If `x > y` and `y < lit[i]` and `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `a`. If `x <= y` and `x == y`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `a`. If `x <= y` and `x < y` and `lit[i] <= y`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `a`. If `x <= y` and `x < y` and `lit[i] > y`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`.**
