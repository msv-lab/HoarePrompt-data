Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is incremented by 1, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `y` is `float('inf')` if `len(b) == 0` or the last element of `b` otherwise, `x` retains its original value or is set to `float('inf')` if `len(a) == 0`, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`. The value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`.**

Explanation:
- The value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`.
- All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
