Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0. If `x` is equal to `y`, then `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is less than `y`, then: if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` is a list with `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[i]`), and `y` is infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`, with `x` being less than `y`. If `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` is a list containing the value `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[i]`), `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `x` is less than `y`. If `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, `b` is a non-empty list containing `lit[i]`, `x` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`. If `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is not greater than `y`, `x`, `y`, and `lit[i]` remain as they were, with `x` being less than `y` and `lit[i]` being between `x` and `y` (inclusive).**
