Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `b` is a list with the second element of `lit` appended to it, if `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of `lit`, if `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to infinity, otherwise `y` is set to the last element of `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the second element of `lit` (since `i` is 1) to the list `b`.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The value of `b` is updated to include the second element of `lit`.
- The conditions for setting `x` and `y` remain the same as in the initial state, but now `b` has at least one element, so `y` will be set to the last element of `b` (which is the second element of `lit`).
