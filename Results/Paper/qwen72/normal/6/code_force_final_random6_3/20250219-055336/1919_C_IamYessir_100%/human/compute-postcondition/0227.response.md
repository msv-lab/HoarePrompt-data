Postcondition: ***`a` is a list with at least `len(a)` elements, `b` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `s` is the count of elements in `a` that are greater than their preceding element, `n` is the input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, and `_` remains unchanged. If `b[1]` is greater than `b[0]`, then `s` is incremented by 1.***
