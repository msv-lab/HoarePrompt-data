Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is `i + 1`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` retains its original value or is set to `float('inf')` if `len(a) == 0`, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`.** 

Explanation:
- The code `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `b` to the variable `y`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
