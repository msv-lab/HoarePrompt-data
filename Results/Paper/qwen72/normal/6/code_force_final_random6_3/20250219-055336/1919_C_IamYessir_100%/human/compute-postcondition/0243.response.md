Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1, the length of `a` is 0, `x` is infinity.**

The code snippet assigns the value of positive infinity to the variable `x`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
