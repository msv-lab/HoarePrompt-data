The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged.**
