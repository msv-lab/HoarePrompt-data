Output State: **`a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `s` is `s + 1`, `n` is the input integer, `cp` and `_` are integers, `_` is incremented by `n`, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`.**

Explanation:
- `s` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `s` is `s + 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
