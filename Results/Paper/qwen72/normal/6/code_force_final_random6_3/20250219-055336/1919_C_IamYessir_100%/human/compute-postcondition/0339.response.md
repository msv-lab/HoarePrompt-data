Output State: **`a` is a list with at least `n + 2` elements, `b` is a list, `i` is `n + 1`, `s` is either 2 or 3, `n` is the input integer, `cp` and `_` are integers, `_` is incremented by `n`, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is incremented by 1, so if `s` was initially 1, it becomes 2. If `s` was initially 2, it becomes 3.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
