Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2. If the length of `lit` is 0, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x >= lit[i]`, `a` is a list that includes the third element of `lit` (i.e., `lit[2]`). If `x < lit[i]` and `lit[2] > y`, `a` is a list that includes the third element of `lit` (i.e., `lit[2]`). If `x < lit[i]` and `y >= lit[2]` and `lit[2] > x`, `b` is a list with the last element being `lit[2]`.**
