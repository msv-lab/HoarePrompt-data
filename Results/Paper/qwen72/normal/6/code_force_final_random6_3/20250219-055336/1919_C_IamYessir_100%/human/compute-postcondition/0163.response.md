Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. If `b` is empty, `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`, and `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to infinity, and `y` is set to the last element of `b`. `x` is less than or equal to `y`. If `x` is equal to `y` (both are infinity), `a` contains the first element of `lit` and `b` remains empty. If `x` is less than `y` and `lit[0]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `a` contains the first element of `lit` and `b` remains empty or unchanged. If `lit[0]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x`, `b` contains the first element of `lit`, `x` is set to infinity, and `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If neither condition is met, the lists and variables remain unchanged.***
