The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus 1, `n` is the input integer, `cp` and `_` are integers, `_` is incremented by `n`, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`. If the second element of `b` is greater than the first element of `b`, `s` is incremented by 1.**
