Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is `i + 1`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `y` retains its original value or is set to `float('inf')` if `len(b) == 0`, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is the last element of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `a` to the variable `x`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
