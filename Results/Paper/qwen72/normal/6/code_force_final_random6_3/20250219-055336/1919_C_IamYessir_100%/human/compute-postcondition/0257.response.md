Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers. `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is infinity. If `b` is not an empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element, and `y` is now equal to `lit[i]`. Additionally, `y` is less than `lit[i]` (which is no longer valid), and the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `x` (which is still valid).**

Explanation:
- The value of `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`.
- The value of `y` is updated to be the last element of `b`, which is now `lit[i]`.
- The condition that `y` is less than `lit[i]` is no longer valid because `y` is now equal to `lit[i]`.
- The condition that the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `x` remains valid.
