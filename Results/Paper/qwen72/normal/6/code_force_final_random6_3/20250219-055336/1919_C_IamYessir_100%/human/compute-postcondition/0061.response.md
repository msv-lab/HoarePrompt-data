Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list containing the second element of `lit`, if `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `lit`. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the second element of `lit` (since `i` is 1) to the list `a`.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The value of `x` and `y` are still determined by the conditions provided in the initial state. If `a` was initially empty, it now contains the second element of `lit`, so `x` is set to the last element of `lit`. The state of `b` and `y` remains unchanged.
