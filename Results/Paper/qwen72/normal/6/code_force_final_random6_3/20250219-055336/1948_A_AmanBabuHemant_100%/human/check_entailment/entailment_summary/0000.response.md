Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.

2. **Special Character Condition**: The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because each pair of special characters (like "AA" or "BB") contributes exactly 2 special characters, and any additional character would break this pattern.

3. **String Generation**: If `n` is even, the program generates a string by repeating the pattern "AAB" `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each "A" in "AAB" is a special character because it is equal to the "A" next to it, and the "B" is not special because it is not equal to any of its neighbors. Therefore, the string generated will have exactly `n` special characters.

4. **Length Check**: The program then checks if the length of the generated string is less than 200. If it is, it prints "YES" followed by the string. If the length is 200 or more, it prints "NO". This is a valid check because the problem specifies that the string should be of length at most 200.

5. **Output Format**: The program follows the required output format for both "NO" and "YES" cases.

Given the above points, the program correctly handles the problem requirements and produces the expected output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
