Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `n` is even; `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, the length of `s` remains less than 200. Otherwise, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200.***
