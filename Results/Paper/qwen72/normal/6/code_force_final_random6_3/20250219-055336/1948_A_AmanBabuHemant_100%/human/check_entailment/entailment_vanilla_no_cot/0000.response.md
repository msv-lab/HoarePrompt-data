Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the integer `n` for each one.

2. **Special Character Check**: The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct because special characters must come in pairs (e.g., "AA", "BB").

3. **String Construction**: If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern "AAB" `n // 2` times. This ensures that each "A" in the pattern "AAB" is a special character because it is equal to its neighbor "A". The length of the string `s` will be `3 * (n // 2)`, which is always even and at most `200` for the given constraints (since `n` is at most `50`).

4. **Output**: The program checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. Since `n` is at most `50`, the length of `s` will be at most `150` (which is `3 * 50`), so this check is always true. It then prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`.

The program meets all the requirements of the problem and produces the correct output for the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
