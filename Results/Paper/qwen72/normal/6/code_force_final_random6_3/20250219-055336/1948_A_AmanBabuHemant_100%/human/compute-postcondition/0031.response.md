Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is less than 200 if `n` is less than 134, and greater than or equal to 200 if `n` is 134 or more.***
