Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is less than 200 if `n` is less than 134, and greater than or equal to 200 if `n` is 134 or more.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations:
- The variable `t` is 0, indicating that there are no more test cases left to process.
- The variable `_` is `t - 1`, meaning it has completed all iterations from 0 to `t - 1`.
- For each test case, the variable `n` is an input integer provided for that specific iteration.
- If `n` is odd, the function prints 'NO' and no changes are made to the variables.
- If `n` is even, the function generates a string `s` consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
- The length of `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`. If this length is less than 200, the function prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If the length is 200 or more, the function prints 'NO'.
