#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The length of the generated string should be at most 200. If no such string can be generated, the function should return "NO".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is less than 200 if `n` is less than 134, and greater than or equal to 200 if `n` is 134 or more.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and checks if `n` is even. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO". If `n` is even and the length of the string generated by repeating 'AAB' `n // 2` times is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the generated string. If the length of the generated string is 200 or more, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
