Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer and is even.
- `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is less than 200.

The code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This print statement simply prints the string 'YES'. There are no variables or objects from the initial state that are directly used in this print statement. The conditions and values described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **YES**
