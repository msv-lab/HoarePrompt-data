Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - If `n` is odd, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
   - If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
   - If the length of `s` is less than 200, the length of `s` remains less than 200.
   - Otherwise, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string 'NO'.
   - The value of `s` and the conditions on `n` do not affect the `print` statement because the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables or conditions.
   - The `print` statement will always print 'NO' regardless of the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, or `s`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement will be the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
