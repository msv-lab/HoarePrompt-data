The only variables in the loop head are `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the integer value provided by the `input()` function. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the integer value from `input()` must be greater than 1.

State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x != y, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `n` == 0 and `m` % 2 != 0, the postcondition remains unchanged. If `n` == 0 and `m` % 2 == 0, the postcondition remains unchanged. If `n` > 0, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the number of digits in the binary representation of `k`, and `q` is 2 raised to the power of (p - 1). The integer value from `input()` must be greater than 1.**
