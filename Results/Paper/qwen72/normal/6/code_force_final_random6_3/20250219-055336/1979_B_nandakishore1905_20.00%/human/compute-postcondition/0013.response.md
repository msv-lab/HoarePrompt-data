Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x != y, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `k` is not a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `p = len(l)` calculates the length of the binary representation of `k` (stored in `l`), and assigns this length to the variable `p`. The values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The binary representation of `k` (stored in `l`) is also unchanged, but now we have the additional information that `p` is the length of this binary representation.
