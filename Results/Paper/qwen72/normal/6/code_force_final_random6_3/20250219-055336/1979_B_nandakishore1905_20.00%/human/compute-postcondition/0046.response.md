The function `func` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers, and they must satisfy the conditions 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x != y. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` where 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x != y, and returns a value based on these inputs.**
