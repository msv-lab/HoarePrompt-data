Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x != y, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the number of digits in the binary representation of `k`, `q` is 2 raised to the power of (p - 1).**

Explanation:
- `q` is assigned the value of `2 ** (p - 1)`.
- The value of `p` is the number of digits in the binary representation of `k`.
- The other variables (`x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`) remain unchanged.
- Therefore, `q` is calculated as 2 raised to the power of (p - 1), where `p` is the number of digits in the binary representation of `k`.
