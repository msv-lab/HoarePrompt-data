Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x != y, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

The code snippet `k = abs(n - m)` updates the value of `k` to be the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. Since the initial state already specifies that `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, the value of `k` remains unchanged. The states of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, and `m` are not affected by this code snippet.
