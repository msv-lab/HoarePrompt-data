The values of `n` and `m` are assigned based on the input, which is split and converted to integers. The input must be two integers, and `n` and `m` will hold these values. The values of `x` and `y` remain distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x != y, and `i` remains 0. 

Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x != y, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0.**
