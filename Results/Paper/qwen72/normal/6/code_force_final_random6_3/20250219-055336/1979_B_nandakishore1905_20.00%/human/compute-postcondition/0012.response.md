Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x != y, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `k` is not a power of 2. `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is assigned the binary representation of `k` with the '0b' prefix removed.
- The initial conditions for `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
