Output State: **`i` is 1, `A`, `B`, and `C` are updated to the input integers, `X` is equal to `A // 2`, and `int(input())` is greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- `i` remains 1.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are still updated to the input integers.
- `X` is assigned the value of `A` divided by 2 using integer division (`A // 2`).
- `int(input())` is still greater than 1, as this condition was part of the initial state and was not altered by the code.
