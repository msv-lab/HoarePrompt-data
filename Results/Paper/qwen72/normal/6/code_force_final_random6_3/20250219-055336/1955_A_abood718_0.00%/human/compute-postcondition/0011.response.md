Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers, and `int(input())` is greater than 0. Additionally, `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`. If `A` is even, no changes are made to `A`, `B`, `C`, or `i`. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to the integer division of `A` by 2, and `A`, `B`, `C`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
