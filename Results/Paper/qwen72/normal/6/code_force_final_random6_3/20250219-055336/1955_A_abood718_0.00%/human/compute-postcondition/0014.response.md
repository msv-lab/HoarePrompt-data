The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `A`, `B`, and `C`. The initial values of `i`, `A`, `B`, and `C` are not directly affected by this operation, but the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are updated to the new input values. The condition checks and the assignment of `X` are not executed in this snippet, so the initial state of `i` and the potential future assignment of `X` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `A`, `B`, and `C` are updated to the input integers, and `int(input())` is greater than 1.**
