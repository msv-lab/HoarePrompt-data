Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program constructs a permutation `p` of length `n` such that no two indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) exist where `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]`. The program achieves this by alternating the placement of the largest and smallest remaining numbers in the permutation. This approach ensures that the conditions of the problem are met for all potential cases, as the alternating pattern prevents any two consecutive numbers from being divisors of each other. The program handles the constraints and input format correctly, and it produces valid permutations for all test cases within the given constraints.
