Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `p` is a list where `p[0]` is `n` and the rest are zeros, `ind` is `n - 2`, `iterations` is greater than the number of iterations completed.**

The value of `ind` is decreased by 2, so it is now `n - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
