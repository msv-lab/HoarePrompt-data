### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.
   - The input handling is consistent with the problem description, where each test case provides a single integer `n`.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The program initializes a list `p` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It then sets `ind` to `n` and fills the even indices of `p` with values in descending order starting from `n` and decrementing by 2.
   - After filling the even indices, it resets `ind` to `1 + n % 2` (which ensures that the starting value for odd indices is 1 if `n` is odd, and 2 if `n` is even).
   - It then fills the odd indices of `p` with values in ascending order starting from the reset `ind` and incrementing by 2.

3. **Validation of Permutation:**
   - The permutation `p` is constructed such that:
     - Even indices: `p[0] = n`, `p[2] = n-2`, `p[4] = n-4`, etc.
     - Odd indices: `p[1] = 1`, `p[3] = 3`, `p[5] = 5`, etc.
   - This construction ensures that no two consecutive elements `p[i]` and `p[i+1]` can both divide two other consecutive elements `p[j]` and `p[j+1]` because:
     - Even indices are filled with large numbers in descending order.
     - Odd indices are filled with small numbers in ascending order.
   - The alternating pattern of large and small numbers prevents any two consecutive elements from being divisors of each other.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For `n = 4`, the permutation is `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.
     - `p[0] = 4`, `p[1] = 1`, `p[2] = 2`, `p[3] = 3`.
     - No two consecutive elements `p[i]` and `p[i+1]` can both divide two other consecutive elements `p[j]` and `p[j+1]`.
   - For `n = 3`, the permutation is `[3, 1, 2]`.
     - `p[0] = 3`, `p[1] = 1`, `p[2] = 2`.
     - No two consecutive elements `p[i]` and `p[i+1]` can both divide two other consecutive elements `p[j]` and `p[j+1]`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the minimum value of `n` (which is 3) correctly.
   - The program also handles larger values of `n` (up to 10^5) correctly by following the same alternating pattern.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly constructs a permutation `p` of length `n` such that no two indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) exist where `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]`. The approach of alternating large and small numbers ensures that the conditions of the problem are met.

Final: **True**
