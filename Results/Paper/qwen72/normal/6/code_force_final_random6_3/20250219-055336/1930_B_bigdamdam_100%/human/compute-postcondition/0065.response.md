Output State: **`n` must be an even number greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 2` (if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, otherwise `i` is undefined), `p` is a list of `n` integers where `p[0]` is `n`, `p[2]` is `n - 2`, `p[4]` is `n - 4`, and so on, with the rest of the elements being zero, `ind` is equal to `n - (2 * (n // 2))` which simplifies to `0` if `n` is even.**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `n` must be an even number greater than or equal to 2.
- The value of `i` will be `n - 2` if `n` is at least 4; otherwise, `i` remains undefined.
- The list `p` will have `n` elements, where the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) will be populated with the values of `ind` starting from `n` and decreasing by 2 for each iteration, and the rest of the elements will remain zero.
- The value of `ind` will be 0 after the loop completes, as it is decremented by 2 in each iteration and the loop runs for `n // 2` iterations.
