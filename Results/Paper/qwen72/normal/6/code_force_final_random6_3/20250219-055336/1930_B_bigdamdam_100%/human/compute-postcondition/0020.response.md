Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `p` is a list where the elements at even indices are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-(i*2)`, and the element at index 1 is `ind` (5 if `n` is odd, or 6 if `n` is even), `p[3]` is `ind` (5 if `n` is odd, or 6 if `n` is even).**

Explanation:
- The value of `ind` is incremented by 2.
- If `n` is odd, `ind` was 3 and is now 5.
- If `n` is even, `ind` was 4 and is now 6.
- The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The list `p` is updated at index 1 and index 3 to reflect the new value of `ind`.
