### Reasoning:

1. **Permutation Validity**: The program constructs a permutation `p` of length `n` where the elements are distinct integers from 1 to `n`. This is ensured by the way the program fills the array `p` with values from `n` down to 1 and from 1 up to `n`.

2. **Condition Check**: The program needs to ensure that there do not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]`.

3. **Permutation Construction**:
   - **Even Indices**: The program fills the even indices of `p` with the largest odd numbers in descending order.
   - **Odd Indices**: The program fills the odd indices of `p` with the smallest even numbers in ascending order.

4. **Divisibility Condition**:
   - By placing the largest odd numbers at even indices and the smallest even numbers at odd indices, the program ensures that the numbers at even indices are not likely to divide the numbers at odd indices, and vice versa.
   - Specifically, the largest odd number (e.g., `n` if `n` is odd) is placed at the first even index, and the smallest even number (e.g., 2) is placed at the first odd index. This pattern continues, ensuring that no two consecutive elements in the permutation can satisfy the divisibility condition.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The program processes multiple test cases, each with a different value of `n`.
   - For each test case, it generates a permutation and prints it, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the smallest valid `n` (which is 3) correctly.
   - It also handles larger values of `n` up to the constraint limit (10^5).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a permutation for each test case that satisfies the given conditions. The construction method ensures that no two consecutive elements in the permutation can satisfy the divisibility condition, and the permutation is valid.

### Correctness:
**True**
