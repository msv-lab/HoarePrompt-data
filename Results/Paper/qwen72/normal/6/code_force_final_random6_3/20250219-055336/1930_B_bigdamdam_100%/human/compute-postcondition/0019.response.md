Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `p` is a list where the elements at even indices are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-(i*2)`, and the element at index 1 is `ind` (3 if `n` is odd, or 4 if `n` is even), `p[3]` is `ind` (3 if `n` is odd, or 4 if `n` is even).**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 3.
- The list `p` is updated such that the element at index 3 is now `ind`.
- The elements at even indices in `p` remain `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-(i*2)`.
- The element at index 1 in `p` remains `ind` (3 if `n` is odd, or 4 if `n` is even).
- The value of `ind` is not changed, but `p[3]` is now equal to `ind`.
