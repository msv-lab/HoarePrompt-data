The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, representing the elements of the list.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the exact return value. However, based on the context, it is likely that the function processes the list `a` for each test case and returns some result based on the processing.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` (length of the list), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). The function processes the list `a` for each test case and returns a result based on the processing.**
