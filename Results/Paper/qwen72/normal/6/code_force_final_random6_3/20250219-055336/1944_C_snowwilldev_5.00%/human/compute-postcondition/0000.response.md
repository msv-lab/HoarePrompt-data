To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for tc in range(int(input())):
```

Here, the only variable directly involved in the loop head is `tc`, and the loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `tc` is the loop variable.
   - `int(input())` is the expression that determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.
   - The loop will not execute if `int(input())` is 0 or negative.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop depends on the value of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that this value is greater than 0.
   - The variable `tc` will start at 0, as it is the default behavior of the `range` function.

### Adjusted State:
- The state before the loop starts should ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0.
- The variable `tc` will be 0 at the start of the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `tc` is 0, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0**.
