### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and deleting them.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c`, while Bob just deletes the picked element.
   - The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` after all elements are picked.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick elements that are not already in `c` and are the smallest possible to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick elements that are already in `c` or the smallest possible to minimize the MEX.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - The variable `t` is used to count the number of unique elements that appear exactly once in `a`.
   - The loop iterates through the range `[0, N-1]` and checks:
     - If the current element `i` appears exactly once in `a`, it increments `t`.
     - If `t` reaches 2 or the current element `i` does not appear in `a`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, it prints the last integer in the range, which is `N-1`.

4. **Correctness of the Strategy:**
   - The program correctly identifies the first integer `i` that either appears exactly once and is the second such unique integer encountered, or is the first integer that does not appear in `a`.
   - This strategy ensures that Alice and Bob are playing optimally because:
     - Alice will always try to pick the smallest unique element to maximize the MEX.
     - Bob will try to pick the smallest element that is already in `c` or the smallest unique element to minimize the MEX.
   - The program correctly handles the case where no such integer is found by printing the last integer in the range.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the array `a` contains all elements from `0` to `N-1` by printing `N` (since `N` is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array).
   - It also handles the case where the array `a` contains multiple occurrences of the same element by correctly counting the unique elements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob and correctly computes the MEX of the array `c` after all elements are picked. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
