Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `N` is a new input integer greater than 2.
- `i` is 1.
- `tc` is 2.
- `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with default integer values and now contains the count of each element in `a`.
- `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.
- If the count of the element at index `i` in `a` is 1, then `t` is set to 1. Otherwise, `t` remains 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.
- The value of `i` is not modified in the given code snippet.
- Therefore, the `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 1.

### Output:
Output: **1**
