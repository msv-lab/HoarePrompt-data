Postcondition: ***`N` is the new input integer greater than 2, `i` is 1, `tc` is 2, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and now contains the count of each element in `a`, and `a` is a new list of integers input by the user. If the count of the element at index `i` in `a` is 1, then `t` is set to 1. Otherwise, `t` remains 0.***
