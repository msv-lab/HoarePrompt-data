Output State: **`N` is the new input integer greater than 2, `i` is `N-1`, `tc` is 2, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and now contains the count of each integer in the list `a`, `t` is the number of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once up to the point where the loop breaks, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a new list of integers from the user input and assigns it to the variable `a`.
- The initial state variables `N`, `i`, `tc`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
- The variable `t` is still the number of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once up to the point where the loop breaks, but since the loop has not been executed yet, `t` remains as it was in the initial state.
- The new list `a` is now populated with the integers provided by the user.
