Postcondition: ***`N` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `tc` is 1, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and now contains the count of each integer in the list `a`, `t` is 0, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user. If the count of `i` (which is 0) in the list `a` is exactly 1, then `t` is set to 1.***
