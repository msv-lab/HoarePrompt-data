Output State: **`N` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is `N-1`, `tc` is 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and contains the count of each integer in the list `a` up to index `N-1`, `t` is the number of times an integer at index `i` in the list `a` has a count of 1, up to the point where the loop breaks. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2, or the count of the integer at index `i` in the list `a` is 0, the loop breaks and prints `i`. Otherwise, the loop completes all iterations and `t` will be the total number of times an integer at index `i` in the list `a` has a count of 1.**
