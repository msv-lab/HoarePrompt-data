Output State: **`N` is the new input integer greater than 2, `i` is 0, `tc` is 2, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and now contains `{a[0]: 1}`, `t` is the number of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once up to the point where the loop breaks, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[0]` in the defaultdict `cnt` by 1.
- Since `i` is 0, the first element of the list `a` is accessed.
- The defaultdict `cnt` is updated to `{a[0]: 1}`.
- The values of `N`, `i`, `tc`, and `t` remain unchanged.
- The list `a` remains the same as it was initially provided by the user.
