Output State: **`N` is the new input integer greater than 2, `i` is 1, `tc` is 2, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and now contains the count of each element in `a`, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `t` is 1 if the count of the element at index 1 in `a` is 1, otherwise `t` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
