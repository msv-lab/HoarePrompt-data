Output State: **`N` is the new input integer greater than 2, `i` is `N-1`, `tc` is 2, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and is now initialized to an empty state, `t` is the number of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once up to the point where the loop breaks, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.**

The `cnt` dictionary is reset to an empty defaultdict with default integer values, while the other variables remain unchanged.
