Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the array `a` contains multiple elements that are the same, and Alice and Bob play optimally. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that if an element appears exactly once, it should be counted towards the MEX. However, this is not always the optimal strategy.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
4
0 0 1 1
```

According to the problem description, the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob would be:
1. Alice picks 1, `a = [0, 0, 1]`, `c = [1]`.
2. Bob picks 0, `a = [0, 1]`, `c = [1]`.
3. Alice picks 0, `a = [1]`, `c = [1, 0]`.
4. Bob picks 1, `a = []`, `c = [1, 0]`.

The MEX of `c = [1, 0]` is 2, which is the correct output.

However, the given program will output:
```
1
```

This is because the program incorrectly counts the number of elements that appear exactly once and uses this to determine the MEX, which does not align with the optimal strategy described in the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
