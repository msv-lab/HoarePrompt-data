Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `day` is 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is the hour part of the input time, `m` is the minute part of the input time, and `h` is not equal to 0. If `h` > 12, `h` is updated to `h` - 12. If `h` is 12, `day` is changed to 'AM'.***
