Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `day` is 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is greater than 1, `h` is the hour part of the input time provided by the user, and `m` is the minute part of the input time provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code snippet `h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))` updates the values of `h` and `m` based on the user input. The user input is expected to be in the format "hh:mm", where `hh` is the hour and `mm` is the minute. The values of `h` and `m` are now the integer representations of the hour and minute parts of the user input, respectively. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `day`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
