To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
   - `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `m` is the minute part of the input time provided by the user.
   - `h` is the hour part of the input time provided by the user.
   - If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` > 12, `h` is the hour part of the input time minus 12 and `day` is 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is 'AM'.
   - Otherwise, `h` remains the hour part of the input time and `day` remains 'PM'.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `h` and `m` are derived from the string `s` which is in the format "hh:mm".
   - The variable `day` is determined based on the value of `h`:
     - If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is set to `h - 12` and `day` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is 12, `day` is 'AM'.
     - Otherwise, `h` remains the same and `day` is 'PM'.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement formats the hour and minute parts of the time and prints them along with the `day` value.
   - The format `'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'` ensures that both `h` and `m` are printed with leading zeros if they are single digits.

4. **Example Calculation**:
   - Suppose `s` is "14:30".
     - `h` is 14.
     - `m` is 30.
     - Since `h` > 12, `h` is set to 14 - 12 = 2 and `day` is 'PM'.
     - The `print` statement will output "02:30 PM".

   - Suppose `s` is "00:15".
     - `h` is 0.
     - `m` is 15.
     - Since `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'.
     - The `print` statement will output "12:15 AM".

   - Suppose `s` is "12:45".
     - `h` is 12.
     - `m` is 45.
     - Since `h` is 12, `day` is 'AM'.
     - The `print` statement will output "12:45 AM".

   - Suppose `s` is "07:20".
     - `h` is 7.
     - `m` is 20.
     - Since `h` is not 0, not greater than 12, and not 12, `h` remains 7 and `day` is 'PM'.
     - The `print` statement will output "07:20 PM".

5. **General Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the time in 12-hour format with the appropriate 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `h`.

Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day} (where {h:02d} is the hour part of the input time in 12-hour format, {m:02d} is the minute part of the input time, and {day} is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the initial state)**
