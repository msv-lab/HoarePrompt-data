Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\). This represents the total number of minutes in a day.
   - `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
   - `n` is greater than 0. This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.
   - `m` is the minute part of the input time provided by the user.
   - `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the initial conditions:
     - If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` > 12, `h` is decreased by 12 and `day` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is 12, `day` is 'AM'.
     - Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `h` and `m` are derived from the string `s` in the format "hh:mm".
   - The value of `day` is determined based on the conditions provided for `h`.

4. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - Extract `h` and `m` from the string `s`.
   - Apply the conditions to determine the value of `day`:
     - If `h` is 0, set `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
     - If `h` > 12, set `h` to `h - 12` and `day` to 'PM'.
     - If `h` is 12, set `day` to 'AM'.
     - Otherwise, set `day` to 'PM'.

5. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `s` is "15:30".
     - `h` = 15, `m` = 30.
     - Since `h` > 12, `h` is set to 15 - 12 = 3 and `day` is set to 'PM'.
     - The print statement will output: "03:30 PM".

   - Suppose `s` is "00:15".
     - `h` = 0, `m` = 15.
     - Since `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'.
     - The print statement will output: "12:15 AM".

   - Suppose `s` is "12:45".
     - `h` = 12, `m` = 45.
     - Since `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'AM'.
     - The print statement will output: "12:45 AM".

   - Suppose `s` is "07:20".
     - `h` = 7, `m` = 20.
     - Since `h` is less than 12, `day` remains 'PM'.
     - The print statement will output: "07:20 PM".

6. **General Output:**
   - The print statement will output the time in the format "hh:mm" with `h` adjusted based on the conditions and `day` set to either 'AM' or 'PM' accordingly.

Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day} (where {h:02d} is the hour part of the time adjusted based on the conditions, {m:02d} is the minute part of the time, and {day} is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the initial conditions)**
