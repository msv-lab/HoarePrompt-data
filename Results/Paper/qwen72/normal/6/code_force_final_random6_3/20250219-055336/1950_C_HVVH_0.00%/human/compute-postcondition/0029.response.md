Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is greater than 1, and `m` is the minute part of the input time provided by the user. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` > 12, `h` is the hour part of the input time minus 12 and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h` remains the hour part of the input time and `day` remains 'PM'.***
