Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the way it determines the AM/PM designation for the hours. Specifically, the program incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' for hours between 1 and 11, and it incorrectly sets `day` to 'AM' for the hour 12. This results in incorrect AM/PM designations for times in the afternoon and evening. 

For example, for the input "01:01", the program will output "01:01 PM" instead of the correct "01:01 AM". Similarly, for the input "12:14", the program will output "12:14 AM" instead of the correct "12:14 PM". 

The correct logic should be:
- Hours from 00 to 11 should be 'AM', with 00 being converted to 12.
- Hours from 12 to 23 should be 'PM', with 12 remaining as 12 and 13 to 23 being converted to 01 to 11.
