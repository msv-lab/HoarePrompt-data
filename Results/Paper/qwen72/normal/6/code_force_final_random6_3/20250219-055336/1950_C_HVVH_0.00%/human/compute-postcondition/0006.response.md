Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is 12, `m` is the minute part of the input time.**

The value of `day` is explicitly set to 'AM', but since it was already 'AM' in the initial state, the value remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
