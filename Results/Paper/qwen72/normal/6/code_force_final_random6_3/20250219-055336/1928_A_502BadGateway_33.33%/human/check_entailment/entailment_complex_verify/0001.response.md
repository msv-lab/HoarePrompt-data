Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if Bob can cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering that rectangles differing only by a 90-degree rotation are the same.

2. **Cutting the Rectangle**: When Bob cuts the rectangle, he can either cut it parallel to the side of length \(a\) or the side of length \(b\). This results in two possible cuts:
   - Cutting parallel to side \(a\) results in two rectangles of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\).
   - Cutting parallel to side \(b\) results in two rectangles of size \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\).

3. **Forming a New Rectangle**: To form a new rectangle that is different from the original, the dimensions of the new rectangle must be different from \(a \times b\) and \(b \times a\). This can only happen if the cut results in two rectangles that can be rearranged to form a rectangle with different dimensions.

4. **Condition for New Rectangle**: For Bob to form a new rectangle, at least one of the dimensions \(a\) or \(b\) must be even. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, cutting the rectangle will result in two smaller rectangles that, when rearranged, will always form the original rectangle or its 90-degree rotation.

5. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine if a new rectangle can be formed.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` checks if \(b\) is even and returns 'yes' if it is, otherwise 'no'.

6. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program only checks if \(b\) is even, but it should check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even to determine if a new rectangle can be formed.
   - The correct condition should be `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the program is flawed because it does not consider the case where \(a\) is even and \(b\) is odd.
   - The program's logic is incomplete and does not cover all necessary cases to determine if a new rectangle can be formed.

Final: **False**
