Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it only checks if the second dimension `b` of the rectangle is even. However, the problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle by cutting the original rectangle and rearranging the pieces. The logic should consider both dimensions `a` and `b` and check if at least one of them is even and greater than 1, as this is the condition that allows Bob to form a different rectangle.

Here is the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    if a == 1 and b == 1:
        return 'no'
    if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'
```

This corrected function checks:
1. If the rectangle is 1x1, it returns "no" because no other rectangle can be formed.
2. If either `a` or `b` is even and greater than 1, it returns "yes" because Bob can form a different rectangle.
3. Otherwise, it returns "no".

This logic correctly addresses the problem requirements.
