The only objects in the loop head are variables `t` and `_`. The loop will execute again if `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is less than `t`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `max` is the maximum value among the second elements of all sorted sublists of length 3 in `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n - 3`, `max` is the maximum value among the second elements of all sorted sublists of length 3 in `a`.**
