To determine what will be printed by the `print(max)` statement, we need to understand the values and conditions provided in the initial state:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet, it's provided as context).
   - `_` is 2 (though `_` is not used in the code snippet, it's provided as context).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `i` is `n - 3`.
   - `max` is the maximum of the middle elements of all possible sorted sublists of length 3 from the list `a`.

2. **Understanding the `max` Calculation**:
   - We need to consider all possible sublists of length 3 from the list `a`.
   - For each sublist, we sort it to find the middle element.
   - We then find the maximum of these middle elements.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:
   - **Sublists of Length 3**: Given `a` is a list of integers, we can generate all sublists of length 3 by iterating through the list. For example, if `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the sublists are `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 4]`, and `[3, 4, 5]`.
   - **Sorting Sublists**: Each sublist is sorted to find the middle element. For the sublists `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 4]`, and `[3, 4, 5]`, the middle elements are 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
   - **Finding the Maximum Middle Element**: We then find the maximum of these middle elements. In the example, the maximum middle element is 4.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print(max)` statement will print the maximum middle element of all possible sorted sublists of length 3 from the list `a`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **max (where max is the maximum of the middle elements of all possible sorted sublists of length 3 from the list `a`)**
