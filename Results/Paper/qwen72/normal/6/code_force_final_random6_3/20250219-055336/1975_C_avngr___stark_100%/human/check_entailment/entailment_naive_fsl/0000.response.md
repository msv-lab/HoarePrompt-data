Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the program only considers subarrays of length 3, which is insufficient to find the maximum possible value that the array can be transformed into.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The expected output is `4`, as described in the problem statement. However, the program will output `3` because it only considers subarrays of length 3. The program will find the maximum median of subarrays of length 3, which is `3` in the subarray `[1, 2, 3]`.

### Why the Program is Incorrect:
- The program should consider all possible subarrays, not just those of length 3.
- The median of a subarray can be any element in the subarray, depending on the length and the values of the elements.
- The program needs to account for subarrays of all lengths from 2 to n to ensure it finds the maximum possible value that the array can be transformed into.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Identify the maximum possible value that can be the median of any subarray.
2. Ensure that this value can be propagated to the entire array through the allowed operations.

The current implementation fails to meet these requirements, making it incorrect.
