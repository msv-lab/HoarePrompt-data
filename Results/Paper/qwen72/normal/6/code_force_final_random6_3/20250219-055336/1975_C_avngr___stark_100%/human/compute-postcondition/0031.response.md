Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n - 3`, `max` is the maximum value among the middle elements of all sorted sublists of length 3 from `a[0]` to `a[n-3]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `max` remain unchanged.
