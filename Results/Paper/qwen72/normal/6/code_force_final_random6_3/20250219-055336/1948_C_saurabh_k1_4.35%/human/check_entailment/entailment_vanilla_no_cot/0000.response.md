Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem. The program checks only if the second-to-last cell in the bottom row (i.e., `b[n-2]`) points to the right (`>`). This is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` because the robot's movement is influenced by both the arrows in the current cell and the arrows in the cells it moves to.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to simulate the robot's movement step by step, considering both the initial move and the subsequent move along the arrow in the current cell. The program should check if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` from the starting cell `(1, 1)` by following the rules of movement.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_reach_end(n, a, b):
    # Initialize the robot's position
    row, col = 1, 1
    
    # Simulate the robot's movement
    while col < n:
        # Determine the next cell based on the robot's current position
        if row == 1:
            if a[col - 1] == '>':
                col += 1
            else:
                row = 2
                col += 1
        else:  # row == 2
            if b[col - 1] == '>':
                col += 1
            else:
                row = 1
                col += 1
    
    # Check if the robot has reached the target cell (2, n)
    return row == 2 and col == n

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        if can_reach_end(n, a, b):
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version simulates the robot's movement through the grid and checks if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`. The function `can_reach_end` handles the simulation, and the main function `func` processes multiple test cases.
