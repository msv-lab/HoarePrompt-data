The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('No')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4).
   - `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input.
   - `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input.
   - The element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'No'`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string `'No'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
