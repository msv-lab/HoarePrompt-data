#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t (an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (where each n is even and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a list of tuples (each containing two strings of length n with characters '<' or '>'), representing the arrows in the grid for each test case.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `_` is equal to the number of test cases minus 1, `n` is the last input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the last input, and `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the last input. If the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, then the condition is met and 'No' is printed. Otherwise, the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is not the string `"<"` and 'Yes' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' or '>'. It then checks if the character at the second-to-last position in `b` is '<'. If it is, the function prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution without returning any value.
