The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. However, the initial state provides some context about the variables and conditions that might influence the execution of the code, even though the `print` statement itself does not directly depend on these variables.

Let's break down the initial state:
- `_` is 1 (this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is an input integer (this variable is not directly used in the code snippet, but it is mentioned in the condition).
- `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input (this list is not used in the code snippet).
- `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input.
- If the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is not the string `"<"`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement will always print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of the variables or the condition described in the initial state. The initial state does not affect the output of the `print` statement because the statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned.

Output: **Yes**
