Postcondition: **`T` is an input integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 1000, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` == 1, the relationship between `a` and `b` is maintained: if `a` == `b`, they are equal; if `a` != `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` is preserved as described in the precondition. If `a` != 1, the relationship between `a` and `b` is maintained based on the parity of `a`: if `b` == 1, the relationship is as described in the else part; if `b` != 1, the relationship between `a` and `b` is maintained as described in the else part, including the conditions on parity and the relative values of `a` and `b`.**
