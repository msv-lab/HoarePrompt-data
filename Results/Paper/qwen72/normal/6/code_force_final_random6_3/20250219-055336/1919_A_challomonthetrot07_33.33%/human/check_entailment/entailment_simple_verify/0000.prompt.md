You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Example

Input

    1 1
    
    1 4
    
    5 3
    
    4 5

    1000000000 1000000000
    
    53110 2024

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Bob

    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers (a, b).
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `T` is an input integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 1000, `i` is `T-1`, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` == `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` is that they are equal. If `a` != `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` is maintained: if `a` is 1, the current value of `a` is 1, and the current value of `b` is not 1. If `a` is not 1, the current value of `a` is not 1, and the relationship between `a` and `b` is preserved: if `a` is odd, `a` remains an odd integer; if `a` is even, `a` remains an even integer; if `a` is even and `b` is odd, then `b` is odd; otherwise, if `a` > `b`, `a` is greater than `b`; if `a` <= `b`, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even and greater than 1 correctly. According to the game rules, if both players have an even number of coins, the player with the larger number of coins will always win because they can force the game into a state where the other player is left with an even number of coins, which is always less than the larger player's even number of coins. However, the program incorrectly assumes that if `a > b`, Bob wins, and if `b > a`, Alice wins, regardless of whether the numbers are even or odd.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 2
```
The program will output "Bob", but the correct output should be "Alice". Alice can always win by swapping wallets, leaving Bob with 4 coins and herself with 2 coins. Bob will then be forced to remove a coin, leaving 3 coins, and Alice can swap again, leaving Bob with 2 coins and herself with 3 coins. This process will continue until Bob is left with 0 coins, and Alice wins.
