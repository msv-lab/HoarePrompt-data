The function reads an integer `T` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `T` <= 1000. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, where 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9. The function then prints a string indicating the winner of each test case based on the following rules: if `a` == `b`, it prints "Bob"; if `a` == 1, it prints "Alice"; if `b` == 1, it prints "Bob"; if `a` is odd, it prints "Bob"; if `a` is even and `b` is odd, it prints "Alice"; if `a` > `b`, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice". The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console.
