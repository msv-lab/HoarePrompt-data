Postcondition: **`T` is an input integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 1000, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` is odd, the relationship between `a` and `b` is maintained: if the new `a` == `b`, they are equal; if the new `a` is 1, the current value of `a` is 1; if the new `a` is not 1, the current value of `a` is not 1, and the relationship between `a` and `b` is preserved: if the new `a` is odd, `a` remains an odd integer; if the new `a` is even, `a` remains an even integer; if the new `a` is even and the new `b` is odd, then `b` is odd; otherwise, if the new `a` > `b`, `a` is greater than `b`; if the new `a` <= `b`, `a` is less than or equal to `b`. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, the relationship between `a` and `b` is maintained: if the new `a` == `b`, they are equal; if the new `a` is 1, the current value of `a` is 1; if the new `a` is not 1, the current value of `a` is not 1, and the relationship between `a` and `b` is preserved: if the new `a` is odd, `a` remains an odd integer; if the new `a` is even, `a` remains an even integer; if the new `a` is even and the new `b` is odd, then `b` is odd; otherwise, if the new `a` > `b`, `a` is greater than `b`; if the new `a` <= `b`, `a` is less than or equal to `b`. If `a` is not even or `b` is not odd, the same relationship between `a` and `b` is maintained as described above.**
