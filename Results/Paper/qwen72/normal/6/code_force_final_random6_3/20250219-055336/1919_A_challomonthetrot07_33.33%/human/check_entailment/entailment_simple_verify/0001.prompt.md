You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers (a, b).
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `T` is an input integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 1000, `i` is `T-1`, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` == `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` is that they are equal. If `a` != `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` is maintained: if `a` is 1, the current value of `a` is 1, and the current value of `b` is not 1. If `a` is not 1, the current value of `a` is not 1, and the relationship between `a` and `b` is preserved: if `a` is odd, `a` remains an odd integer; if `a` is even, `a` remains an even integer; if `a` is even and `b` is odd, then `b` is odd; otherwise, if `a` > `b`, `a` is greater than `b`; if `a` <= `b`, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The program reads an integer `T` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

2. **Winning Conditions**:
   - **If `a == b`**: Both players have the same number of coins. Since Alice goes first, she will always be the one to make the last move, leaving Bob with no valid move. Therefore, Bob wins.
   - **If `a == 1`**: Alice has only 1 coin. She must remove it on her first turn, leaving her wallet empty. Bob then wins because Alice cannot make a move.
   - **If `b == 1`**: Bob has only 1 coin. Alice can swap wallets with Bob on her first turn, leaving Bob with 1 coin. Bob must remove it on his turn, leaving his wallet empty, and Alice wins.
   - **If `a % 2 == 1`**: Alice has an odd number of coins. Since Alice goes first, she can always force Bob to have an even number of coins by removing one coin each turn. This means Bob will eventually be forced to have 1 coin, and Alice will win.
   - **If `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`**: Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins. Alice can always swap wallets with Bob to force him to have an even number of coins, and then remove one coin to make it odd again. This strategy ensures Alice wins.
   - **If `a > b`**: Alice has more coins than Bob. If both players have an even number of coins, Alice can always remove one coin to make her number of coins odd, forcing Bob to have an even number of coins. This strategy ensures Alice wins.
   - **Otherwise**: Bob wins.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `a == b` by printing "Bob" because Bob will always win in this scenario.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `a == 1` by printing "Alice" because Bob will win.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `b == 1` by printing "Bob" because Alice will win.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `a % 2 == 1` by printing "Bob" because Alice will win.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` by printing "Alice" because Alice will win.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `a > b` by printing "Bob" because Alice will win.
   - The program correctly handles the remaining cases by printing "Alice" because Bob will win.

However, there is a logical error in the conditions:
- **If `a == 1`**: The program should print "Bob" because Alice will lose immediately after her first move.
- **If `b == 1`**: The program should print "Alice" because Bob will lose immediately after his first move.
- **If `a % 2 == 1`**: The program should print "Alice" because Alice can always force Bob to have an even number of coins, and Bob will eventually be forced to have 1 coin.
- **If `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`**: The program should print "Bob" because Bob can always force Alice to have an odd number of coins, and Alice will eventually be forced to have 1 coin.
- **If `a > b`**: The program should print "Alice" because Alice can always force Bob to have fewer coins.
- **Otherwise**: The program should print "Bob" because Bob will win.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has incorrect logic in the conditions for determining the winner. Specifically, the conditions for `a % 2 == 1` and `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` are reversed. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a > b:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
```

This corrected version should accurately determine the winner based on the given problem description.
