The given `print` statement simply prints the string 'Alice'. The initial state describes the values and relationships of variables `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables and their values do not influence the `print` statement in any way. The `print` statement is independent of the initial state provided.

Output: **Alice**
