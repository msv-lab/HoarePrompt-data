Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `T` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - The function does not take any parameters, which is fine because it reads the inputs directly from `input()`.

2. **Game Logic**:
   - If `a == b`, Bob wins because the game will end in a tie, and Bob will be the one to make the last move.
   - If `a == 1`, Alice wins because Bob cannot force Alice to swap, and Alice will always be able to remove the last coin.
   - If `b == 1`, Bob wins because Alice will eventually be forced to swap, and then Bob will be able to remove the last coin.
   - If `a` is odd, Bob wins because Bob can always force Alice to play with an odd number of coins, and eventually, Alice will be forced to play with 1 coin.
   - If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice wins because Alice can always force Bob to play with an even number of coins, and eventually, Bob will be forced to play with 1 coin.
   - If `a > b`, Bob wins because Bob can always force Alice to play with fewer coins, and eventually, Alice will be forced to play with 1 coin.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, Alice wins.

3. **Edge Cases and General Logic**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are equal.
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `a` or `b` is 1.
   - The function correctly handles the parity (odd/even) of `a` and `b` to determine the winner.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `a` is greater than `b`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the winner for each test case, which is the expected behavior.

However, there is a logical error in the function:
- The condition `elif a % 2 == 1` is incorrect. If `a` is odd, Bob can always force Alice to play with an odd number of coins, and eventually, Alice will be forced to play with 1 coin, which means Bob wins. This condition should be `elif a % 2 == 1: print('Bob')`.
- The condition `elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` is correct because if `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice can always force Bob to play with an even number of coins, and eventually, Bob will be forced to play with 1 coin, which means Alice wins.
- The condition `elif a > b` is incorrect. If `a` is greater than `b`, it does not necessarily mean Bob wins. The correct condition should be `elif a > b and a % 2 == 0: print('Alice')` and `elif a > b and a % 2 == 1: print('Bob')`.

Given these issues, the function is not correct as it stands.

Correctness: **False**
