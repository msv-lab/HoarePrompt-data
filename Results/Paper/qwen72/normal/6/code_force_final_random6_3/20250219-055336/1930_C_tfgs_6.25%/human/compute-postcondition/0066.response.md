Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`n`**: An input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(n\) must be greater than 0.
3. **`a`**: A list of unique integers where each integer \(a_i\) was originally in the range \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and has been increased by \(i + 1\) (where \(i\) ranges from 0 to \(n-1\)). The list `a` is now sorted in descending order.
4. **`i`**: Equal to `len(a) - 1`.
5. **`counter`**: A Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated and now unique list `a`, but the count of each element in `a` is decreased by 1.
6. **`cnt`**: Initialized to 0.
7. **`ans`**: A list containing all elements of `a` in their original order, and additional elements that fill the gaps between consecutive elements of `a` such that the total number of elements in `ans` is \(n + cnt\). The last element of `ans` is `ans[-1] - cnt`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**:
   - `a` is a list of unique integers, each increased by \(i + 1\) and sorted in descending order.
   - For example, if `a` originally was `[10, 20, 30]` and `n = 3`, then after increasing each element by \(i + 1\), `a` becomes `[32, 21, 12]` and is sorted in descending order to `[32, 21, 12]`.

2. **Counter Object**:
   - `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` but decreases each count by 1.
   - Since `a` is a list of unique integers, the count of each element in `counter` will be 0.

3. **Variable `cnt`**:
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 and is not modified in the given initial state.

4. **List `ans`**:
   - `ans` is constructed to contain all elements of `a` in their original order.
   - Additional elements are added to fill the gaps between consecutive elements of `a` such that the total number of elements in `ans` is \(n + cnt\).
   - The last element of `ans` is `ans[-1] - cnt`.

### Example Construction:
Let's assume `n = 5` and `a` originally was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

1. **Increase each element by \(i + 1\)**:
   - `a` becomes `[5 + 1, 4 + 2, 3 + 3, 2 + 4, 1 + 5]` which is `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]`.
   - Since `a` must be unique, let's assume the original list was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and after increasing, it becomes `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` but with unique values, it could be `[11, 10, 9, 8, 7]` (assuming the original values were adjusted to be unique).

2. **Sort `a` in descending order**:
   - `a` becomes `[11, 10, 9, 8, 7]`.

3. **Construct `ans`**:
   - `ans` starts with the elements of `a` in their original order: `[11, 10, 9, 8, 7]`.
   - Additional elements are added to fill the gaps between consecutive elements of `a` such that the total number of elements in `ans` is \(n + cnt\).
   - Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` will have 5 elements.
   - The last element of `ans` is `ans[-1] - cnt`, which is `7 - 0 = 7`.

### Final Output:
The list `ans` will contain the elements of `a` in their original order, which are unique and sorted in descending order. Since `cnt` is 0, no additional elements are added, and the last element remains the same.

Output: **11 10 9 8 7**
