The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, we can infer that the function likely accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
- `a`: a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the elements in the list.

The function's output is not specified, but typically, such a function would process the list `a` for each test case and return some result based on the elements in the list. Since the specific output is not provided, we can only describe the parameters and the general expectation that the function will return some result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 10^4), `n` (an integer between 1 and 3 · 10^5), and `a` (a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9). The function processes the list `a` for each of the `t` test cases and returns a result based on the elements in the list for each test case.**
