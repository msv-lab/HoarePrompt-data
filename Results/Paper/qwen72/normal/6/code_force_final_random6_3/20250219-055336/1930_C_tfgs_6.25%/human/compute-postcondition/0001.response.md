Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of `n` integers. After executing the code, `a` is updated to the list of integers read from the input, and the other conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
