To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `e`: This is the result of `heappop(min_heap)`, which is a tuple containing an element from `row` and its index.
   - `min_heap`: This is the min-heap from which the element is popped.
   - `i`: This is the current index.
   - `d`: This is a variable that is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`.

2. **Understand the Condition:**
   - The loop will execute if the index of the element popped from `min_heap` (i.e., `e[1]`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

3. **Initial State:**
   - `row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0.
   - `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`.
   - `i` is greater than `d + 3`.
   - `min_heap` contains elements from `row[:d]` and their respective indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed from the heap, and `e` has been added to the heap.
   - `row[i-1]` is equal to `e[0] + row[i-1] + 1`.
   - The tuple `(row[i-1], i-1)` has been added to `min_heap`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute.
   - `e` is the element popped from `min_heap`, and `e[1]` is the index of that element.
   - `i` is greater than `d + 3`, so `i - (d + 2)` is greater than 1.
   - For the loop to execute, `e[1]` must be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

5. **Ensuring the Condition:**
   - Since `min_heap` contains elements from `row[:d]` and their respective indices, and the first three elements and their indices have been removed, the smallest index in `min_heap` is at least `3`.
   - To ensure that `e[1]` (the index of the element popped from `min_heap`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`, we need to ensure that `i - (d + 2)` is at least 3.
   - This means `i` must be at least `d + 5` (since `i - (d + 2) >= 3` implies `i >= d + 5`).

### Final Adjusted State:
- `row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0.
- `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`.
- `i` is greater than or equal to `d + 5`.
- `min_heap` contains elements from `row[:d]` and their respective indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed from the heap, and `e` has been added to the heap.
- `row[i-1]` is equal to `e[0] + row[i-1] + 1`.
- The tuple `(row[i-1], i-1)` has been added to `min_heap`.

State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0; `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`; `i` is greater than or equal to `d + 5`; `min_heap` is a min-heap containing the elements from `row[:d]` and their respective indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed from the heap, and `e` has been added to the heap; `row[i-1]` is equal to `e[0] + row[i-1] + 1`; the tuple `(row[i-1], i-1)` has been added to `min_heap`.**
