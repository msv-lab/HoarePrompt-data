### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Initial State**: The function `func_1` is called with a list `row` of non-negative integers where `row[0]` and `row[-1]` are initially 0, and a positive integer `d` such that \(1 \le d < \text{len(row)}\).
   - **First Modification**: The function sets `row[0] = 1`, which is correct because a support must be installed at the first column.
   - **Loop for Initial `d` Cells**: The function increases the value of each element from index 1 to \(d-1\) by 2. This is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal placement of supports. The cost of installing a support should be \(a_{i,j} + 1\), not \(a_{i,j} + 2\).
   - **Heap Initialization**: The function initializes a min-heap with the first `d` elements of the row. This is a good approach to keep track of the minimum cost of supports.
   - **Main Loop**: The function iterates over the remaining elements of the row starting from index `d`. For each element, it pops elements from the heap until it finds an element that is within the distance constraint \(d\). It then updates the current cell's cost and pushes the updated cost back into the heap.
   - **Final State**: The function returns `row[-1]`, which is the cost of the last support. This is correct because a support must be installed at the last column.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Input Reading**: The function reads the input correctly, including the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, bridges `k`, and maximum distance `d`.
   - **Row Processing**: The function processes each row using `func_1` and stores the costs in the list `costs`.
   - **Total Cost Calculation**: The function calculates the total cost for each possible segment of `k` consecutive rows and stores these costs in `total_costs`.
   - **Output**: The function prints the minimum total cost from `total_costs`.

### Issues in `func_1`:
- **Cost Calculation for Initial `d` Cells**: The function incorrectly adds 2 to the cost of the first `d` cells. This is a mistake because the cost of installing a support should be \(a_{i,j} + 1\), not \(a_{i,j} + 2\).
- **Heap Management**: The function uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of supports, which is a good approach. However, the initial cost calculation for the first `d` cells is incorrect, leading to incorrect heap values and subsequent cost calculations.

### Example Test Case:
Consider the test case:
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 100 0 100 0
```
- **Expected Output**: The optimal placement of supports would be at columns 1, 3, and 5. The cost would be \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\).
- **Actual Output**: The function will incorrectly calculate the cost as \(1 + 102 + 1 = 104\) because it adds 2 to the cost of the second cell, which is not the optimal solution.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the installation of supports according to the problem's constraints, particularly the requirement that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. The incorrect cost calculation for the first `d` cells leads to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
