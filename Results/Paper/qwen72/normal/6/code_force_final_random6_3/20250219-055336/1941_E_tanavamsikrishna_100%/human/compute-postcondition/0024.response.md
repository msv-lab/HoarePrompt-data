To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

### Loop Condition:
```
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
```
- The loop condition depends on the value of `e[1]` (the index part of the tuple) and the value of `i - (d + 2)`.

### Current State:
- `row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0.
- `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`.
- `i` is greater than or equal to `d + 5`.
- `min_heap` is a min-heap containing the elements from `row[:d]` and their respective indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed from the heap, and `e` has been added to the heap.
- `row[i-1]` is equal to `e[0] + row[i-1] + 1`.
- The tuple `(row[i-1], i-1)` has been added to `min_heap`.

### Analysis:
1. **`e` and `min_heap`**:
   - The loop condition checks the index part of the tuple `e` that is popped from `min_heap`.
   - Since `min_heap` is a min-heap, the smallest element (based on the first part of the tuple) will be popped first.
   - The current state indicates that `e` has been added to `min_heap`, and the tuple `(row[i-1], i-1)` has been added to `min_heap`.

2. **`i` and `d`**:
   - The loop condition also depends on `i - (d + 2)`.
   - Given that `i` is greater than or equal to `d + 5`, `i - (d + 2)` is at least 3.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `e[1]` (the index part of the tuple) must be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.
- Since `i` is greater than or equal to `d + 5`, `i - (d + 2)` is at least 3.
- The current state does not specify the exact value of `e[1]`, but it must be less than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable that can be adjusted in the loop head is `e[1]`.
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `e[1]` must be less than or equal to 3.

### Final State:
State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0; `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`; `i` is greater than or equal to `d + 5`; `min_heap` is a min-heap containing the elements from `row[:d]` and their respective indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed from the heap, and `e` has been added to the heap; `row[i-1]` is equal to `e[0] + row[i-1] + 1`; the tuple `(row[i-1], i-1)` has been added to `min_heap`; `e[1]` must be less than or equal to 3**.
