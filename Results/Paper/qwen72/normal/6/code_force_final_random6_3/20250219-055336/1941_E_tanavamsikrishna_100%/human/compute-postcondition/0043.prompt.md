Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0; `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`; `i` is `d-1`; `min_heap` is now a min-heap containing the elements from `row[:d]` and their respective indices.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(d, len(row)):
    while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
        pass
    row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
    heappush(min_heap, e)
    heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0; `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`; `i` is greater than `d + 2`; `min_heap` is a min-heap containing the elements from `row[:d]` and their respective indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed from the heap, and `e` has been added to the heap; `row[i]` is now equal to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`; the tuple `(row[i], i)` has been added to `min_heap`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0; `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`; `i` is greater than or equal to `d + 5`; `min_heap` is a min-heap containing the elements from `row[:d]` and their respective indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed from the heap, and the tuples `(row[i-1], i-1)` and `(row[i], i)` have been added to the heap; `e` is the last value popped from `min_heap` and satisfied the loop condition; `row[i]` is now equal to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has completed all its iterations. `row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0; `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`; `i` is `d + 6`; `min_heap` is a min-heap containing elements from `row[:d]` with their indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed, and the tuples `(row[i-1], i-1)` and `(row[i], i)` have been added to the heap; `e` is the last value popped from `min_heap` and does not satisfy the loop condition; `row[i]` is now equal to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`. The tuple `(row[i], i)` has been added to `min_heap`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
