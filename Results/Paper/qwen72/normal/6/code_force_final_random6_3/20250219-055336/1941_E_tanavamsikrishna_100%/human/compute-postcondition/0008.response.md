To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the given state:

### Given State:
- `n` must be at least `k + 1`
- `i` is 1
- `costs` is a list of length `n`
- `total_costs` is a list with two elements:
  - The first element is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`
  - The second element is the sum of the elements from index 1 to index `k` of `costs`

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `len(costs)` is `n`
   - Therefore, the loop condition is `i < n - (k - 1)`, which simplifies to `i < n - k + 1`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - So, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n - k + 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- The condition `i < n - k + 1` must still hold for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be at least `k + 1`, `i` is 2, `costs` is a list of length `n`, `total_costs` is a list with two elements: the first element is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, and the second element is the sum of the elements from index 1 to index `k` of `costs`.**
