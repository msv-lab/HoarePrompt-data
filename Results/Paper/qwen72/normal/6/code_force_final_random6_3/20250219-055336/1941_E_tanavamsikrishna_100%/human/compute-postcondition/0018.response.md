Output State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0; `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`; `i` is greater than `d + 2`; `min_heap` is now a min-heap containing the elements from `row[:d]` and their respective indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed from the heap; `row[i]` is now equal to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.**
