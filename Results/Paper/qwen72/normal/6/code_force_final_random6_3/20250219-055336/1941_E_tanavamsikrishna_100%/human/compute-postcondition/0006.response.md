The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `costs`, and the parameter `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be at least `k`, which means `costs` has at least `k` elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `costs` must still have enough elements to satisfy the condition `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

Given that `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 1, which means `len(costs)` must be at least `k + 1`.

State: **`n` must be at least `k + 1`, `i` is 1, `costs` is a list of length `n`, `total_costs` is a list with one element which is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`.**
