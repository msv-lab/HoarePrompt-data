Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the first four integers read from the standard input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the first and last columns being 0. `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of applying `func_1` to the corresponding row in `rows` with the parameter `d`. `total_costs` is an empty list.**
