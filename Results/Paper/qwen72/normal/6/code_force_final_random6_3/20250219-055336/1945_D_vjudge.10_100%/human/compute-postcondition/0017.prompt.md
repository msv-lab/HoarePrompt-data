You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 \le pergunta \le 10^4), a is a list of n integers (1 \le a_i \le 10^9), b is a list of n integers (1 \le b_i \le 10^9), n is an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill (1 \le n \le 200,000), and m is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 \le m \le n). The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: `pergunta` is the minimum value between the original `pergunta` and the sum of `x` and `a[i]` for all `i` where `i < m`. `x` is the sum of the minimum values between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`. `i` is `-1`. The lists `a` and `b`, and the integers `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: min(original pergunta, x + a[-1]) (where x is the sum of min(a[i], b[i]) for all i from 0 to n-1, and a[-1] is the last element of the list a)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m`. It returns the final position of Kirill in the queue for each test case, ensuring that the position does not exceed the maximum allowable final position `m`.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
