Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `pergunta` is the minimum value between the original `pergunta` and the sum of `x` and `a[i]` for all `i` where `i < m`.
2. `x` is the sum of the minimum values between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`.
3. `i` is `-1`.
4. The lists `a` and `b`, and the integers `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `x`**:
   - `x` is calculated as the sum of the minimum values between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`.
   - This means `x` is the sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.

2. **Understanding `pergunta`**:
   - `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum value between the original `pergunta` and the sum of `x` and `a[i]` for all `i` where `i < m`.
   - Since `i` is `-1`, the condition `i < m` is always true (because `-1` is less than any non-negative integer `m`).
   - Therefore, `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum value between the original `pergunta` and the sum of `x` and `a[-1]`.

3. **Final Value of `pergunta`**:
   - The final value of `pergunta` will be the minimum of the original `pergunta` and the sum of `x` and `a[-1]`.
   - `x` is the sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - `a[-1]` is the last element of the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(pergunta)` statement will print the minimum value between the original `pergunta` and the sum of `x` and `a[-1]`, where `x` is the sum of the minimum values between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

Output: **min(original pergunta, x + a[-1]) (where x is the sum of min(a[i], b[i]) for all i from 0 to n-1, and a[-1] is the last element of the list a)**
