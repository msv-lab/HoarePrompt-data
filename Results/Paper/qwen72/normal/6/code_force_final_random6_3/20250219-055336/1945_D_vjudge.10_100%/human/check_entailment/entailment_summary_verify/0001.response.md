### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `numCasos`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and then the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')`, which is a good choice to ensure it starts with the highest possible value and can be updated to the minimum cost.

3. **Loop and Cost Calculation:**
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0` (i.e., from the last person to the first person in the queue).
   - For each person at position `i`:
     - If `i` is less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of its current value and the cost of moving Kirill to position `i` (which is `x + a[i]`).
     - It then adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`. This step is crucial because it accumulates the cost of moving Kirill past the person at position `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the minimum cost stored in `pergunta`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The algorithm correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions.
  - The key insight is that Kirill can move to any position `j` before `i` by paying `a[j]` and then paying `b[k]` for each person between `j` and `i`.
  - By iterating from the end of the queue to the beginning, the algorithm ensures that it considers the cost of moving Kirill to each possible position in the correct order.
  - The use of `min(a[i], b[i])` in the accumulation of `x` is correct because it represents the minimum cost to move past the person at position `i`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `m` is equal to `n` (i.e., Kirill can stay at the end of the queue) by correctly initializing `pergunta` to `float('inf')` and updating it as needed.
  - The program also handles the case where `m` is less than `n` by only considering positions `i` that are less than `m`.

### Function Summary Verification:
- The function `func_1` is described as follows:
  - It accepts parameters `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m`.
  - It initializes `x` to `0`.
  - It iterates from `n-1` to `0`.
  - For each `i`:
    - If `i` is less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`.
    - It adds `min(a[i], b[i])` to `x`.
  - Finally, it prints the value of `pergunta`.
