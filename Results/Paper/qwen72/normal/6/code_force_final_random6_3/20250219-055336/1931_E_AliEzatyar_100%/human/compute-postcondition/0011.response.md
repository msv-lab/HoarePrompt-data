The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `num`. The loop iterates in reverse, starting from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(num) - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 to `len(num) - 3`, and `num` must still be a list of integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9, and the length of `num` must be at least 3 (since `i` is `len(num) - 3` and the loop runs until `i` is `-1`).

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9, and the length of `num` is an integer `n` such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `m` is an integer (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6), `i` is `len(num) - 3`. If `num[i]` is '0', `counter` is 1 or 2 depending on the previous iteration's outcome. Otherwise, `counter` is 0 or 1 depending on the previous iteration's outcome, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
