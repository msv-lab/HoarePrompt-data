You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `num` and returns the number of trailing zeros in the list, counting from the end of the list until the first non-zero element is encountered. If there are no trailing zeros, the function returns 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Anna and Sasha, who take turns manipulating a list of integers.
   - Anna reverses the digits of a chosen integer.
   - Sasha concatenates two chosen integers and inserts the result back into the list.
   - The game ends when Sasha can no longer make a move, i.e., when there is only one integer left in the list.
   - Sasha wins if the final integer is greater than or equal to \(10^m\), otherwise Anna wins.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The total number of digits in the list is crucial because it determines the potential length of the final concatenated number.
   - Anna's moves do not change the total number of digits in the list.
   - Sasha's moves reduce the number of elements in the list but increase the length of the final number.
   - The game will always end because the number of elements in the list decreases by one with each of Sasha's moves.

3. **Strategy:**
   - To determine the winner, we need to check if the total number of digits in the final number can be at least \(m+1\) (since \(10^m\) has \(m+1\) digits).
   - Anna's moves can only affect the order of digits within individual numbers, not the total number of digits.
   - Sasha's moves will always reduce the number of elements by one and concatenate two numbers, which increases the length of the final number.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers \(n\) and the threshold \(m\).
   - It then reads the list of integers and calculates the total number of digits.
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of a number.
   - The program keeps track of the number of trailing zeros in the list and sorts them in descending order.
   - It then calculates the total number of trailing zeros that can be subtracted from the total number of digits (in pairs).
   - Finally, it checks if the adjusted total number of digits is greater than or equal to \(m+1\).

5. **Issues and Corrections:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts trailing zeros.
   - The program correctly calculates the total number of digits.
   - However, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. The program subtracts the number of trailing zeros in pairs, which is not necessary for determining the winner. The total number of digits should be the primary factor.
   - The correct approach should be to check if the total number of digits in the list is at least \(m+1\) after all possible moves.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
    if total_digits >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program incorrectly subtracts trailing zeros in pairs, which is not relevant to the game's outcome.
- The corrected program directly checks if the total number of digits is at least \(m+1\), which is the correct approach.

Correctness: **False**
