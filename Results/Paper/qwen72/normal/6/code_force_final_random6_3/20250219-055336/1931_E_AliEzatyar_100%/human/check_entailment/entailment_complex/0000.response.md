### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `array`.

2. **Digit Counting and Trailing Zeros**:
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to 0, which will keep track of the total number of digits in the list.
   - It also initializes an empty list `zeros` to store the number of trailing zeros in each integer.
   - For each integer in the list, it converts the integer to a string and adds the length of the string to `total_digits`.
   - It calls `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in the string representation of the integer and appends the result to `zeros`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `num` and counts the number of trailing zeros.
   - It iterates from the end of the string to the beginning, incrementing a counter `counter` for each trailing zero until it encounters a non-zero digit.
   - The function returns the count of trailing zeros.

4. **Trailing Zeros Handling**:
   - The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order.
   - It initializes `subtract_zero` to 0, which will be used to subtract the total number of trailing zeros that can be removed by Anna.
   - It iterates through the `zeros` list in steps of 2, adding the value of `zeros[i]` to `subtract_zero`. This is because Anna can reverse the digits of an integer, and the trailing zeros will be removed.

5. **Winning Condition**:
   - The program checks if the absolute value of `total_digits - subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If it is, Sasha wins, and the program sets `answers[test]` to 'Sasha'.
   - Otherwise, Anna wins, and the program sets `answers[test]` to 'Anna'.

6. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results stored in the `answers` list.

### Issues:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function `func_1` is designed to count trailing zeros in a string, but the program passes each integer in the list as a string to this function.
  - The function should be called with `item` as a string, which is correct in the given program.

- **Trailing Zeros Calculation**:
  - The program correctly calculates the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros for each integer.
  - However, the logic for subtracting the trailing zeros is flawed. Anna can reverse the digits of any integer, and the trailing zeros will be removed, but the program only subtracts the trailing zeros in pairs. This is incorrect because Anna can reverse any single integer, and the trailing zeros will be removed immediately.

- **Winning Condition**:
  - The winning condition is based on the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros. However, the program's logic for determining the winner is flawed. It should consider the maximum possible number of digits that can be removed by Anna, not just the sum of trailing zeros in pairs.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic for counting trailing zeros and determining the winner is incorrect. Anna can reverse any single integer, and the trailing zeros will be removed immediately, not in pairs. Therefore, the program's approach to subtracting trailing zeros is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
