Precondition: **The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and the arrays `a` for each test case, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful.**
