Functionality: **The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `a`, a list of integers for each test case, where the length of `a` is `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The function is expected to process these inputs and return a result based on the provided parameters, but the specific output is not defined in the given information.**
