Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value between the initial `ans` and 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `cnt = 0` sets the variable `cnt` to 0.
- The value of `cnt` was previously 1 or 2 if `arr[i]` was equal to `val`, otherwise it was 0. Now, `cnt` is explicitly set to 0.
- The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between its initial value and 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `t`, `arr`, `flag`, `val`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
