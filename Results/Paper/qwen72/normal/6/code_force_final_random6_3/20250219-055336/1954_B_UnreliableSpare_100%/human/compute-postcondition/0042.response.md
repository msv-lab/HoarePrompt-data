To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`n`**: This is the input integer, representing the length of the list `arr`.
2. **`t`**: This is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). It is not directly used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
3. **`arr`**: This is a list of integers input by the user.
4. **`i`**: This is set to `n-1`, which means it points to the last index of the list `arr`.
5. **`flag`**: This is set to `False` because not all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element.
6. **`val`**: This is the first element of `arr`.
7. **`cnt`**: This is the number of consecutive elements from the last change (or 0 if the last element is not equal to `val`).
8. **`ans`**: This is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` found in the array, updated to be the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`.

Given the initial state, we need to understand the value of `ans`:

- `ans` is updated to be the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
- `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements from the last change, or 0 if the last element is not equal to `val`.

Since the exact values of `arr` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, `ans` will be the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` found in the array.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr` found in the array)**
