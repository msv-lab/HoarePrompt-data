Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, `flag` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `flag` retains its initial value.***
