The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is the first element of `arr`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 1 or 2, and `ans` is the minimum value between `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum value between the initial `ans` and `cnt`.**
