Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `flag` is True, and the function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. Additionally, the second element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[1]`) is not equal to the first element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[0]`).**
