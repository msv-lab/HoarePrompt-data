Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `flag` is False, and the second element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[1]`) is not equal to the first element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[0]`). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
