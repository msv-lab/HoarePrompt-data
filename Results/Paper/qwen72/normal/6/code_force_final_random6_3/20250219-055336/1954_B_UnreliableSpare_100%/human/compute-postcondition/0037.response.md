Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements from the last change (or 0 if the last element is not equal to `val`), and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` found in the array.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n`**: The input integer remains unchanged.
- **`t`**: An integer within the range 1 to 10^4, which is not affected by the loop.
- **`arr`**: The list of integers input by the user remains unchanged.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has iterated through all elements of the list.
- **`flag`**: This variable is not directly modified by the loop, so it retains its initial value. It is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element, otherwise False.
- **`val`**: The first element of `arr` remains unchanged.
- **`cnt`**: This variable counts the number of consecutive elements equal to `val` from the last change. If the last element in the array is not equal to `val`, `cnt` will be 0.
- **`ans`**: This variable holds the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` found in the array. If no such consecutive elements are found, `ans` will remain `Decimal('Infinity')`.
