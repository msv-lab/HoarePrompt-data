Postcondition: **`n` is the input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `flag` is True, indicating that all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements from the last change (or 0 if the last element is not equal to `val`), and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` found in the array, updated to be the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`.**
