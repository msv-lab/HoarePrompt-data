You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and the arrays `a` for each test case, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes without breaking, or the index at which `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i-1]` if the loop breaks. `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element, otherwise `flag` is False.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
        
    #State: `n` is the input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements from the last change (or 0 if the last element is not equal to `val`), and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` found in the array.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr` found in the array)
    #State: *`n` is the input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `val` is the first element of `arr`, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` found in the array, updated to be the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`. If `flag` is True, it indicates that all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element. If `flag` is False, it indicates that not all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `a`, a list of integers for each test case, where the length of `a` is `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The function is expected to process these inputs and return a result based on the provided parameters, but the specific output is not defined in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
