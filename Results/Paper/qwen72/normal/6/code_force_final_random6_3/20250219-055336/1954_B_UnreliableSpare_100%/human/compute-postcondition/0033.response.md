The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `cnt`.

- If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 1 or 2.
- If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `cnt` is 0.
- `ans` is initially the minimum value between `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element, otherwise `flag` is False.
- `val` is the first element of `arr`.
- `cnt` is 1 or 2 if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, otherwise `cnt` is 0.
- `ans` is the minimum value between `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt`.

After executing the code snippet:
- If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 1 or 2, and `ans` will be updated to the minimum of the current `ans` (which is `cnt` since `Decimal('Infinity')` is greater than any integer) and `cnt`, so `ans` will remain `cnt`.
- If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` will be updated to the minimum of the current `ans` (which is `cnt` since `Decimal('Infinity')` is greater than any integer) and 0, so `ans` will be 0.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 1 or 2 if `arr[i]` is equal to `val` and `ans` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
