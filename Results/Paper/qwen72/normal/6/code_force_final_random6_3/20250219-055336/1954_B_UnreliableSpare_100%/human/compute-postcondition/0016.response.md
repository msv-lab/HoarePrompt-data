Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes without breaking, or the index at which `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i-1]` if the loop breaks. `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element, otherwise `flag` is False.**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- The value of `t` remains the same, being an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- The list `arr` remains unchanged.
- The variable `i` will be `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations without finding any unequal consecutive elements. If the loop finds an unequal pair of consecutive elements, `i` will be the index at which this inequality occurs.
- The variable `flag` will be True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element. If any element is not equal to its previous element, `flag` will be set to False and the loop will terminate early.
