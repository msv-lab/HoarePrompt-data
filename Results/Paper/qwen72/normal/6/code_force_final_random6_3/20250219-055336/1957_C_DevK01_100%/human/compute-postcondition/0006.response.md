The code `dp.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `dp`. The initial state specifies that `dp` is a list with three elements: `[1, 3, (3 + 2 * (3 - 1) * 1) % (7 + 10)]`. Let's calculate the third element:

- `(3 + 2 * (3 - 1) * 1) % (7 + 10)` simplifies to `(3 + 2 * 2 * 1) % 17`, which further simplifies to `(3 + 4) % 17`, and finally to `7 % 17`, which is `7`.

So, the initial `dp` list is `[1, 3, 7]`.

After executing `dp.pop(0)`, the first element `1` is removed, and the list `dp` becomes `[3, 7]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and it is guaranteed that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `dp` is a list with two elements: [3, 7]**.
