The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop starts from `i = 2` and goes up to `n + 1`, so for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2. Before the loop starts, `dp` is a list with two elements, both set to 1. This does not need to be adjusted as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `i` should start at 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and it is guaranteed that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `dp` is a list with two elements, both set to 1; `i` is 2**
