### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Looping:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and updates the size of the chessboard `n` based on whether the move is mirrored or not.

2. **Updating the Chessboard Size:**
   - If the move `(a, b)` is such that `a != b`, the program correctly reduces `n` by 2, as both the player's move and the computer's mirrored move occupy two unique positions.
   - If `a == b`, the program correctly reduces `n` by 1, as the move is on the diagonal and the computer skips its turn.

3. **Dynamic Programming Function:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is designed to compute the number of possible final configurations using dynamic programming.
   - The `dp` list is initialized with `[1, 1]`, which are the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1`.
   - The loop iterates from `2` to `n`, updating the `dp` list with the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`.
   - The formula is derived from the problem of placing non-attacking rooks on a reduced board, where the number of configurations for `n` rooks is based on the configurations for `n-1` and `n-2` rooks.
   - The `dp` list is maintained with only the last two elements, which is efficient and correct for the dynamic programming approach.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and updates the board size based on the given moves.
- The dynamic programming function `func_1(n)` is correctly implemented to compute the number of possible final configurations.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the required range.

Therefore, the given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments.

### Correctness: **True**
