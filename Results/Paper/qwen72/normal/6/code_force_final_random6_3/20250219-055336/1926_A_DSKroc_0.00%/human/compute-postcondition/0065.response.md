Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases. It then reads `t` distinct strings of length 5, each consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. For each string, the function counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters. After processing all the strings, the function prints 'A' if the number of 'A' characters in the last string is greater than the number of 'B' characters, and prints 'B' otherwise. The function does not return any value. **
