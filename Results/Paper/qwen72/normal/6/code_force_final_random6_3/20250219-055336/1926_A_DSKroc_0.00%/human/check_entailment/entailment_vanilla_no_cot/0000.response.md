Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided is incorrect because the `if ac > bc:` condition is placed outside the loop that iterates over the test cases. This means that after processing all test cases, the program will only print the result for the last test case, rather than printing the result for each test case individually.

To fix this, the `if ac > bc:` condition should be inside the loop that iterates over the test cases. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
```

This corrected version will correctly print the most frequent character for each test case.
