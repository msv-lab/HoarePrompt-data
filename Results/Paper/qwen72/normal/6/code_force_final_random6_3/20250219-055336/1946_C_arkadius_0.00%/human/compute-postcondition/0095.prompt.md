Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `stack` is a list containing a single tuple `(s, False)`.
Code of the loop:
while stack:
    v, postorder = stack.pop()
    if not postorder:
        stack.append((v, True))
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            stack.append((u, False))
    if postorder:
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u
                ].good_components
            if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
            else:
                tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u
                    ].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is equal to `s`, and `postorder` is `False`. If `postorder` is `False`, `stack` is updated to contain the tuple `(s, True)` followed by tuples `(u, False)` for each child of `tree.vertices[s]`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least as many children as the number of iterations the loop executed. If `postorder` is `True`, the loop has processed all children of `v`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to its original value plus the sum of `good_components` of all children of `v`. For each child `u` of `v`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further increased by 1. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to its original value plus the sum of `remaining_size` of all such children.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains one element fewer than before. If `postorder` is True, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of `v` plus the number of children `u` whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. If `postorder` is False, `stack` is updated to include the tuple `(v, True)` at the top, and for each child `u` of `tree.vertices[v]`, the tuple `(u, False)` is appended to the top of `stack`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the value of the first element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains one element fewer than before and must still contain at least one element. If `postorder` is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` have been fully iterated over, and `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is now equal to the sum of `good_components` of all its children plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. Additionally, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to the sum of the `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. If `postorder` is False, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have been fully iterated over, and `stack` now contains tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v` appended to it in the order they were iterated.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
