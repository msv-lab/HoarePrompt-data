Postcondition: ***`tree` is an instance of the Tree class representing a tree with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` < `n`, `mid` is `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, and `beg` must be less than `end`. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns True, `beg` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `end` is updated to `mid - 1`.***
