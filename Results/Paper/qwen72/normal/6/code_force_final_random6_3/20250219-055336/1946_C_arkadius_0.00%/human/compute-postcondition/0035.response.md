Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains the same elements as before, plus the tuple `(v, True)` at the top.** 

The code snippet appends the tuple `(v, True)` to the `stack`. The values of `tree`, `s`, `x`, `v`, and `postorder` remain unchanged, but the `stack` now has one additional element, making it one element larger than it was before. The new top element of the `stack` is `(v, True)`.
