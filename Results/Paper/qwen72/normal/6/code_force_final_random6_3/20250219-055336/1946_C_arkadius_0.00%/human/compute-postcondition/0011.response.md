Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class initialized with `n` nodes, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `n-1` edges have been added to the `tree` connecting the nodes as specified by the pairs of integers `u` and `v` provided by the user.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged, with `n` being an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5.
- The `tree` object is still an instance of the `Tree` class, initialized with `n` nodes.
- The loop variable `i` has reached the value `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The `tree` now contains `n-1` edges, which have been added based on the pairs of integers `u` and `v` provided by the user, connecting the nodes `u-1` and `v-1` for each pair.
