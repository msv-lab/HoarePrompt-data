Output State: **`tree` is an instance of the Tree class representing a tree with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` < `n`, `beg` is equal to `end`, and `mid` is equal to `beg`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `beg` and `end` will be equal, and `mid` will also be equal to `beg` (or `end`). The tree and the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The loop terminates when `beg` is no longer less than `end`, which happens when `beg` and `end` converge to the same value.
