Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ k < n â‰¤ 10^5, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class initialized with `n` nodes, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `u` and `v` are input integers.**

The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `u` and `v`. The values of `n`, `k`, `tree`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new variables `u` and `v` are now integers based on the input provided.
