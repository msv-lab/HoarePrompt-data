Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains one element fewer than before, `postorder` is True, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of `v` plus the number of children `u` whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The `tree` object remains a Tree with `n` vertices.
- The starting vertex `s` remains an integer within the range 1 to `n`.
- The integer `x` remains unchanged.
- The variable `v` is still the first element popped from `stack` before the loop started.
- The variable `postorder` is still True.
- The `stack` now contains one element fewer than it did before the loop started.
- The `good_components` attribute of the vertex `v` is updated to be the sum of the `good_components` of all its children, plus the count of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`.
- The `remaining_size` attribute of the vertex `v` is updated to be the sum of the `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.
