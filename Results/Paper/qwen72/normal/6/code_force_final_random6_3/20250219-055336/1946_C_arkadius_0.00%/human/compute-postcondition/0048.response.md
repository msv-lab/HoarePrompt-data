Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains one element fewer than before, `postorder` is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child vertex, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is now `tree.vertices[v].good_components` + `tree.vertices[u].good_components` + 1, and the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is incremented by 1.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
