Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0' after the first `hd` positions, and `hd` is `a1 - a2 - min(hd, n)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `a2` is updated to the number of '1' characters in the string `s2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `i`, `res`, and `hd`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
