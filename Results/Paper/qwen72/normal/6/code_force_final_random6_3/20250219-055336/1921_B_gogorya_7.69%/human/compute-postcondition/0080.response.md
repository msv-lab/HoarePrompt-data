Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s1` and `s2` are strings, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 1, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus 1 if the first character of `s1` is '1' and the first character of `s2` is '0', otherwise `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`. If `hd` > 0, `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` if `a1 - a2` is greater than 0, otherwise `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 + 1`. If `hd` <= 0, `hd` remains `a1 - a2` (or `a1 - a2 - 1` if the first character of `s1` is '1' and the first character of `s2` is '0' and `a1 - a2` was greater than 0). The program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement after the loop.***
