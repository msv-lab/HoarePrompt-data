Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are input strings, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 2, and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`. If `s1[2]` is '1' and `s2[2]` is '0', `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `hd` remains unchanged in all cases.***
