Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 1, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1` if `s1[0]` is '1' and `s2[0]` is '0' and `a1 - a2` > 0, otherwise `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1` if `s1[0]` is '1' and `s2[0]` is '0' and `a1 - a2` â‰¤ 0, or `hd` is `a1 - a2` if `s1[0]` is not '1' or `s2[0]` is not '0'. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop.**
