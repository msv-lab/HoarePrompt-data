The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. After one iteration, `t` is decreased by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must now be greater than 0 but less than it was at the start of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is an input string, `s2` is an input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0' after the first `hd` positions, and `hd` is `a1 - a2 - min(hd, n)`**
