Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal is flawed. Here is a test case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
Input:
1
4
1 2 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

In this test case, the array is `[1, 2, 2, 1]`. The program should output `2` because the minimum number of burles required to make all elements equal is 2 (by setting the elements from index 1 to 2 to 1, resulting in the array `[1, 1, 1, 1]`). However, the program outputs `3`, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function, particularly in the way it handles the indices and the conditions for breaking out of the loops. The program does not correctly identify the optimal subarray to set to a single value, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
