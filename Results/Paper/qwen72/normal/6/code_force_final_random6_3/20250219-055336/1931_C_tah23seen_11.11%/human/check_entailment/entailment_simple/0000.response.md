### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.
   - It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` at the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then enters a loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the elements at `i` and `j` are equal. If they are, it increments `i` and decrements `j`. If they are not, it breaks the loop.

3. **Post-Loop Conditions:**
   - If the loop completes without breaking (i.e., `i` becomes greater than `j`), it means the array is already a palindrome, and no operation is needed, so it returns 0.
   - If the loop breaks early, it means there are elements that are not equal, and the program needs to determine the minimum cost to make the array equal.

4. **Handling Non-Palindromic Arrays:**
   - The program then enters another loop to find the first index `i` where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
   - If `j` is not the last index of the array, it returns the cost of the operation from `i` to `j` (i.e., `j - i + 1`).
   - If `j` is the last index, it returns the cost of the operation from `i` to `j` (i.e., `j - i`).

### Analysis:
- **Palindrome Check:**
  - The initial loop correctly identifies if the array is a palindrome. If it is, the function returns 0, which is correct.
- **Non-Palindromic Arrays:**
  - The second loop correctly finds the first index `i` where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
  - The program then correctly calculates the cost of the operation to make the array equal by either:
    - Returning `j - i + 1` if `j` is not the last index.
    - Returning `j - i` if `j` is the last index.

However, there is a potential issue with the logic for non-palindromic arrays:
- The program assumes that the minimum cost is always the difference between `i` and `j` plus 1. This is not always correct. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the program will return 4, which is correct. But if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4]`, the program will return 1, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 4, as you need to change the last element to make the array equal.

### Conclusion:
The program is not correct for all cases, particularly when the array is not a palindrome and the minimum cost is not simply the difference between `i` and `j` plus 1.

### Correctness:
**False**
