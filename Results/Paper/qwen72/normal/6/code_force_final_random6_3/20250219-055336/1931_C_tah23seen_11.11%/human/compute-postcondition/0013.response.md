Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= arr[i] <= len(arr). If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is 2 and `j` is `len(arr) - 3`, and `len(arr) - 3` must be greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, if `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is `len(arr) - 2`, and `len(arr) - 2` must be greater than or equal to 1. If the condition `len(arr) - 2` or `len(arr) - 3` is not met, the loop or if statement is broken and no further adjustments are needed.***
