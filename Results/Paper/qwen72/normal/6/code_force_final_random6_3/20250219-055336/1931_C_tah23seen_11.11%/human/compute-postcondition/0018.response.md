Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5 and `len(arr) >= 5`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is 3 and `j` is `len(arr) - 4`. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is `len(arr) - 2`. If the else part is executed, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
