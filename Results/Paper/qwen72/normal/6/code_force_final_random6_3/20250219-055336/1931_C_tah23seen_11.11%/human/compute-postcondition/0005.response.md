Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= arr[i] <= len(arr), `i` is 1, `j` is len(arr) - 2, and the first element of `arr` (arr[0]) is equal to the last element of `arr` (arr[len(arr) - 1]).**

The value of `j` is decremented by 1, so it is now `len(arr) - 2`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
