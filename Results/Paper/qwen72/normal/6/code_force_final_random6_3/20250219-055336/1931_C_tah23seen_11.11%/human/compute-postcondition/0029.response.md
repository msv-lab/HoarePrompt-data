Output State: **`i` is the index where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`. `j` remains unchanged.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop continues to increment `i` as long as `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
- When the loop finishes, `i` will be at the index where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or `i` will be at the last index of the array (`len(arr) - 1`) if all elements from the starting index are equal.
- The variable `j` is not modified within the loop, so it remains unchanged from its initial value.
