You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= arr[i] <= len(arr).
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: If the loop completes all iterations, then `i` is `len(arr) // 2` and `j` is `len(arr) // 2 - 1` if `len(arr)` is even, or `i` is `len(arr) // 2 + 1` and `j` is `len(arr) // 2 - 1` if `len(arr)` is odd. If the loop breaks early, then `i` and `j` are the indices where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: If the loop completes all iterations, then `i` is `len(arr) // 2` and `j` is `len(arr) // 2 - 1` if `len(arr)` is even, or `i` is `len(arr) // 2 + 1` and `j` is `len(arr) // 2 - 1` if `len(arr)` is odd. If the loop breaks early, then `i` and `j` are the indices where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`. Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `j`.
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is the index where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`. `j` remains unchanged.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the difference between `j` and `i`, plus 1.
    #State: *`i` is the index where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`. `j` remains unchanged, and `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
    return j - i
    #The program returns the difference between `j` and `i`, where `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1` and `i` is the index where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns different values based on the content of the list: it returns 0 in Case_1, the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1 in Case_2, and the difference between `j` and `i` where `j` is the last index of the list and `i` is the index where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` is the last index in Case_3.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the difference between `j` and `i`, plus 1.

Case_3: The program returns the difference between `j` and `i`, where `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1` and `i` is the index where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
