The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `j` is `len(arr) - 2`, so after the decrement, `j` becomes `len(arr) - 3`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= arr[i] <= len(arr). If `arr[0]` is equal to `arr[len(arr) - 1]`, then `i` is 2 and `j` is `len(arr) - 3`, and `len(arr) - 3` must be greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, the loop has broken and no further adjustments are needed.**
