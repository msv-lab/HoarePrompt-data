Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5 and `len(arr) >= 5`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is 3 and `j` is `len(arr) - 4`. Otherwise, if `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is 2 and `j` is `len(arr) - 3`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is decremented by 1, so if `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, `j` becomes `len(arr) - 4`. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`, `j` becomes `len(arr) - 3`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
