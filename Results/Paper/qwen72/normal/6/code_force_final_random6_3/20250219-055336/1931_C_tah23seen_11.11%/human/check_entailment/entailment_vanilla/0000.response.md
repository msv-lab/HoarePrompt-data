### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to make all elements of the array equal by applying a single operation that assigns a value to a subarray of length \(j - i + 1\) at a cost of \(j - i + 1\) burles.
   - The operation can be applied at most once, and we need to find the minimum cost to achieve the goal.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \(n\) and the array itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to compute the minimum cost.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then enters a loop where it checks if the elements at the current positions of `i` and `j` are equal. If they are, it moves both pointers inward (`i += 1` and `j -= 1`).
   - If the pointers cross each other (`i > j`), it means the array is already a palindrome or all elements are equal, so the cost is 0.
   - If the elements at `i` and `j` are not equal, it breaks out of the loop.
   - The function then enters another loop to find the first position where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` and moves `i` inward.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the operation, which is `j - i + 1` if `j` is not the last element of the array, otherwise `j - i`.

4. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The logic for finding the minimum cost is flawed. The function does not correctly handle the case where the array is not a palindrome and the minimum cost should be calculated differently.
   - The function assumes that the minimum cost is always `j - i + 1` or `j - i`, which is not always correct. For example, if the array has a single unique element that is different from the rest, the cost should be 1, not `j - i + 1`.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach should be to find the most frequent element in the array and calculate the cost to make all elements equal to this most frequent element.
   - If the array is already all the same, the cost is 0.
   - If the array is not all the same, the cost should be the length of the subarray that needs to be changed to the most frequent element.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for determining the minimum cost is incorrect and does not handle all possible cases.

**Correctness: False**
