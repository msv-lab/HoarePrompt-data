Output State: **`t` is a specific positive integer provided by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is equal to `n / 2`.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `n / 2` to the variable `g`. Since `count` is 2, `g` becomes `n / 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
