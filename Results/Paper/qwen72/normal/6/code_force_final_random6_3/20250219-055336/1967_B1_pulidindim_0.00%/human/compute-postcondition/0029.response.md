Output State: **`t` is a specific positive integer provided by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4, `count` is 5, `ans` is now equal to `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (g / 4 + 1) + (g / 4 + 1)`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is now equal to `n / 4 - 3`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
