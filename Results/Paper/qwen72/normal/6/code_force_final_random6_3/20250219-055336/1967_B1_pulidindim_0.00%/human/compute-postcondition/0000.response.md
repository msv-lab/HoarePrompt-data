Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. `t` is now a specific positive integer provided by the user.**
