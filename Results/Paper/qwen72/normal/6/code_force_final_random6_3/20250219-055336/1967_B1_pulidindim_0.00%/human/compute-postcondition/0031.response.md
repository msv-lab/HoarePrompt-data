To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a specific positive integer provided by the user and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user.
- `count` is `m + 1`.
- `ans` is the sum of `n` and a series of values calculated in each iteration of the loop, where each value is \((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1\) for `k` from 2 to `m`.
- The loop breaks if `g` (which is \(n / k - (k - 1)\)) is less than `countmins` (which is `k - 1`) at any iteration.

### Code Breakdown:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `ans` starts with the value of `n`.
   - `count` is `m + 1`.

2. **Loop:**
   - The loop iterates from `k = 2` to `k = m`.
   - For each `k`, the value \(g\) is calculated as \(n / k - (k - 1)\).
   - If \(g\) is less than `countmins` (which is `k - 1`), the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, the value \((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1\) is added to `ans`.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(int(ans))` statement will print the integer value of `ans`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
- **Initial Value of `ans`:**
  - `ans = n`.

- **Loop Iteration:**
  - For each `k` from 2 to `m`:
    - Calculate \(g = n / k - (k - 1)\).
    - If \(g < k - 1\), break the loop.
    - Otherwise, add \((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1\) to `ans`.

- **Example Calculation:**
  - Let's assume `n = 10` and `m = 5` for a concrete example.
  - `count = m + 1 = 6`.

  - **Iteration 1 (k = 2):**
    - \(g = 10 / 2 - (2 - 1) = 5 - 1 = 4\).
    - \(4 \geq 1\) (so the loop continues).
    - \((10 / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 = (5 - 1) / 2 + 1 = 4 / 2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3\).
    - `ans = 10 + 3 = 13`.

  - **Iteration 2 (k = 3):**
    - \(g = 10 / 3 - (3 - 1) = 3.33 - 2 = 1.33\).
    - \(1.33 \geq 2\) (so the loop breaks).

  - **Final Value of `ans`:**
    - `ans = 13`.

- **Output:**
  - The `print(int(ans))` statement will print the integer value of `ans`, which is 13 in this example.

### General Description:
- The value of `ans` is initially `n`.
- The loop adds a value to `ans` for each `k` from 2 to `m` as long as \(g \geq k - 1\).
- The value added in each iteration is \((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1\).
- The loop may break early if \(g < k - 1\).

### Final Output:
Output: **int(ans) (where ans is the sum of n and the series of values calculated in each iteration of the loop, and the loop breaks if g is less than countmins at any iteration)**

This output is the integer value of `ans` after the loop has completed or broken early.
