To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the formula used to compute `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a specific positive integer provided by the user and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user.
- `count` is equal to `m + 1`.
- `ans` is equal to `n + Σ((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1) for k from 2 to m`, where `k` is the loop counter starting from 2 and incrementing by 1 each iteration.
- The loop will stop either when `count` exceeds `m` or when `g` (which is `n / count - (count - 1)`) is less than `count - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `count` is initialized to `m + 1`.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts with `k = 2` and increments `k` by 1 each iteration.
   - For each `k` from 2 to `m`, the term \((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1\) is added to `ans`.
   - The loop continues until `count` exceeds `m` or `g` is less than `count - 1`.

3. **Formula Breakdown:**
   - The term \((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1\) can be simplified as follows:
     - \( \text{term} = \left( \frac{n}{k} - (k - 1) \right) / k + 1 \)
     - \( \text{term} = \frac{n / k - k + 1}{k} + 1 \)
     - \( \text{term} = \frac{n / k - k + 1 + k}{k} \)
     - \( \text{term} = \frac{n / k + 1}{k} \)
     - \( \text{term} = \frac{n + k}{k^2} \)

4. **Summation:**
   - The summation \(\sum_{k=2}^{m} \frac{n + k}{k^2}\) is added to `n` to get `ans`.

### Final Calculation:
- `ans` is computed as:
  \[
  \text{ans} = n + \sum_{k=2}^{m} \frac{n + k}{k^2}
  \]
- The `print(int(ans))` statement will print the integer part of `ans`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 10` and `m = 5` for a concrete example:
- Initialize `ans` to `10`.
- Compute the summation:
  - For \( k = 2 \):
    \[
    \text{term} = \frac{10 + 2}{2^2} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
    \]
  - For \( k = 3 \):
    \[
    \text{term} = \frac{10 + 3}{3^2} = \frac{13}{9} \approx 1.44
    \]
  - For \( k = 4 \):
    \[
    \text{term} = \frac{10 + 4}{4^2} = \frac{14}{16} = 0.875
    \]
  - For \( k = 5 \):
    \[
    \text{term} = \frac{10 + 5}{5^2} = \frac{15}{25} = 0.6
    \]
- Sum the terms:
  \[
  \sum_{k=2}^{5} \frac{10 + k}{k^2} = 3 + 1.44 + 0.875 + 0.6 = 5.915
  \]
- Add the sum to `n`:
  \[
  \text{ans} = 10 + 5.915 = 15.915
  \]
- Print the integer part of `ans`:
  \[
  \text{int(ans)} = 15
  \]

### General Output:
Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables and the formula.

Output: **int(ans) (where ans is the value of n + Σ((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1) for k from 2 to m)**
