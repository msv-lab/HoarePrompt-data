### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **inaccurate**. Let's analyze the program and the function summary to understand why.

1. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input.
   - It creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It reverses the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of the list `a`.
   - Finally, it prints the modified list.

2. **Behavior Analysis**:
   - The list `a` is initially a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - Reversing the elements at even indices means that the elements at positions 0, 2, 4, etc., are placed in reverse order.
   - This operation does not change the relative order of the elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, etc.).

3. **Divisibility Condition**:
   - The problem requires that there should not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the elements at even indices are not in their original order, which helps in breaking the divisibility pattern.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For `n = 4`, the initial list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - After reversing the elements at even indices, the list becomes `[4, 2, 3, 1]`.
   - Let's check the divisibility condition:
     - `p_1 = 4` does not divide `p_3 = 3`.
     - `p_2 = 2` does not divide `p_4 = 1`.
   - For `n = 3`, the initial list is `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - After reversing the elements at even indices, the list becomes `[3, 2, 1]`.
   - Let's check the divisibility condition:
     - `p_1 = 3` does not divide `p_3 = 1`.
     - `p_2 = 2` does not divide `p_4` (since `p_4` does not exist).

5. **General Case**:
   - For any `n`, the list `a` is initially `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
   - After reversing the elements at even indices, the list becomes `[n, 2, n-1, 4, n-2, 6, ..., 1]` if `n` is even, or `[n, 2, n-1, 4, n-2, 6, ..., 1, n-1]` if `n` is odd.
   - In this modified list, the elements at even indices are large numbers, and the elements at odd indices are small numbers. This ensures that the divisibility condition is not met because large numbers are unlikely to divide small numbers, and vice versa.

### Conclusion:
The program's approach of reversing the elements at even indices effectively breaks the divisibility pattern required by the problem. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is not accurate.

### Final:
**True**
