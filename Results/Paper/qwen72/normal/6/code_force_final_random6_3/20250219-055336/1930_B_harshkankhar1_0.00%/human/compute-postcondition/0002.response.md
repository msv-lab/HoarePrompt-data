To determine what will be printed by the `print(a)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the structure of the list `a`:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), with elements at even indices reversed.

2. **Understanding the List `a`**:
   - The list `a` starts with integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order.
   - Elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are reversed. This means the elements at these indices are swapped with the elements at the corresponding odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...).

3. **Example**:
   - If `n = 5`, the initial list `a` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - After reversing elements at even indices:
     - Element at index 0 (1) is swapped with element at index 1 (2).
     - Element at index 2 (3) is swapped with element at index 3 (4).
     - Element at index 4 (5) remains unchanged because there is no corresponding element at index 5.
   - The resulting list `a` would be `[2, 1, 4, 3, 5]`.

4. **General Case**:
   - For any `n`, the list `a` will start with integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order.
   - Elements at even indices will be swapped with the elements at the next odd indices, up to the last even index (if `n` is odd, the last element remains unchanged).

5. **Output**:
   - The `print(a)` statement will print the list `a` after the elements at even indices have been reversed.

Output: **[2, 1, 4, 3, 5, ..., n-1, n-2, n] (where the elements at even indices are swapped with the elements at the next odd indices, and the last element remains unchanged if `n` is odd)**.
