It seems there is a mismatch between the provided function definition and the problem description. The problem description outlines a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` that takes two parameters, `start` and `end`, to generate files for HTML files in subfolders named within a specified range. However, the function definition provided is `def func():`, which does not match the problem's requirements.

Given the problem description, the correct function definition should be:
```python
def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):
```

Now, extracting the precondition from the problem description:

Precondition: **start and end are integers where start <= end, and they represent the range of subfolder names to be considered, which are expected to be numeric.**
