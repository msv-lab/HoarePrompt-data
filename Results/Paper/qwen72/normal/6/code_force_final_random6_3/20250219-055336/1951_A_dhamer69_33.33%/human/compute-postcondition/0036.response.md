Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, and `count_1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decreased by 1 again, making it 2 less than its initial value. The values of `start`, `end`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1` remain unchanged.
