The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the user. The function then checks if the string `s` meets certain conditions based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 2, it prints 'YES' if `s` is '00', otherwise it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than 2, it prints 'NO' if the count of '1' in `s` is odd or if there is exactly one occurrence of '11'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variables `start` and `end` (if they exist) remain unchanged.
