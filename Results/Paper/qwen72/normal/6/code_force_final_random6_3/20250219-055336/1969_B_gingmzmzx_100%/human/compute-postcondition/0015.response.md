Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string that must have at least 2 integers, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where the element at index `c` is incremented by 1, `c` is the second integer in the list `s`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0.
- If `cnt[1]` is not greater than 0, `ans` remains unchanged.
- All other variables (`n`, `s`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, `c`) retain their initial values and conditions.
