The only object in the loop head is the variable `n`, so we can only adjust `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. Since the loop variable `_` is not used, the loop will simply decrement `n` by 1 for each iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of zeros in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of ones in `s`, `ans` is the total number of pairs (i, j) such that `s[i] == 0` and `s[j] == 1` and `i < j`**
