Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order. 

Here is a test case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
1010
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

The program calculates the cost as 3, but the correct minimum cost to sort the string "1010" is 4. The optimal strategy is to perform two cyclic shifts on the substrings [1, 2] and [3, 4]:

1. Choose substring [1, 2]: "1010" → "0110"
2. Choose substring [3, 4]: "0110" → "0101"

The total cost is 2 + 2 = 4. The program's logic does not account for this optimal strategy, leading to an incorrect result.
