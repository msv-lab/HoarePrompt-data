You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and calculates the total number of pairs `(i, j)` where `s[i]` is '0' and `s[j]` is '1', and `i < j`. The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state includes `n` being 0, `s` being the list of integers derived from the last input string, `zeroes` being the count of zeros in the last `s`, `cnt` being a list with the counts of zeros and ones in the last `s`, and `ans` being the total number of valid pairs for the last input string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine the minimum total cost to cyclically shift substrings of a binary string to make it sorted in non-descending order.
   - The cost of a shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of all shifts.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a binary string.
   - The output is the minimum total cost for each test case.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `s` and converts it to a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeroes in the string `s`.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is 0, it adds 1 to `ans` if there are any 1s before it (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`).
     - If `c` is 1, it adds the number of remaining zeroes to `ans` (i.e., `zeroes - cnt[0]`).
   - Finally, it prints the total cost `ans` for each test case.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
   - The key insight is that the cost of sorting a binary string is the sum of the lengths of the substrings that need to be shifted to move all 1s to the right of all 0s.
   - The program correctly counts the number of 0s and 1s and calculates the cost based on the positions of 1s and 0s in the string.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by outputting 0.
   - It also handles the case where the string is not sorted and needs multiple shifts to become sorted (e.g., "101011").

6. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of the program is O(n * m), where `n` is the number of test cases and `m` is the length of the string. This is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using the given operations.

Correctness: **True**
