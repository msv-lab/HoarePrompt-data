Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and calculates the total number of pairs `(i, j)` where `s[i]` is '0' and `s[j]` is '1', and `i < j`. The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state includes `n` being 0, `s` being the list of integers derived from the last input string, `zeroes` being the count of zeros in the last `s`, `cnt` being a list with the counts of zeros and ones in the last `s`, and `ans` being the total number of valid pairs for the last input string. **
