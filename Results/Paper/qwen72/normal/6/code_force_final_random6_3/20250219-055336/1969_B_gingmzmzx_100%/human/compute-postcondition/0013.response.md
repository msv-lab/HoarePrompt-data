The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c` and the list `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `s`. If `s` has at least one more integer, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` must have at least 1 integer, and `c` is the first integer in the list `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 2 integers. The variable `c` will be updated to the next integer in the list `s`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string that must have at least 2 integers, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where the element at index `c` is incremented by 1, `c` is the second integer in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is 0. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.**
