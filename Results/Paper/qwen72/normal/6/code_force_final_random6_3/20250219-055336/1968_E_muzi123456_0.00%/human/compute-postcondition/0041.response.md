Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 48) and is now `t - 3` with `t` being at least 3, `n` is a new input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), `i` is `n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains a positive integer within the range 0 to 48, and it is still `t - 3` with `t` being at least 3. This means `t` is unchanged by the loop.
- The variable `n` remains the same input integer within the range 2 to 10^3. This means `n` is also unchanged by the loop.
- The variable `i` starts at `n` and is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. After the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`, and the final value of `i` is `n` when the loop condition `i <= n` is no longer satisfied.
