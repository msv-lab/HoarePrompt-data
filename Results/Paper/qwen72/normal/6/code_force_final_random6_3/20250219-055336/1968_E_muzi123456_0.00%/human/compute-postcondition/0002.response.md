Output State: **The function `func` does not take any input parameters, but it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), representing the size of an n x n grid. The number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) provided by the user, and `t` is now `t - 1`.**
