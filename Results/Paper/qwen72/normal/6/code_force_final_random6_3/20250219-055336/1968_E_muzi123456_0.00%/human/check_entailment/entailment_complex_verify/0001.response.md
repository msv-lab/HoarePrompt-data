### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires selecting \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is defined as \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution provided in the program always selects cells in the first row of the grid, i.e., \((1, i)\) for \( i \) in the range from 1 to \( n \).
   - This means the selected cells are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), ..., \((1, n)\).

3. **Evaluating the Distances:**
   - For any two cells \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) where \( i \neq j \), the Manhattan distance is \( |1 - 1| + |i - j| = |i - j| \).
   - The possible values of \( |i - j| \) range from 1 to \( n-1 \) because \( i \) and \( j \) are distinct and both range from 1 to \( n \).

4. **Set of Distances:**
   - The set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain all integers from 1 to \( n-1 \).
   - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \( n-1 \).

5. **Maximizing the Set:**
   - The maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( n-1 \), which is achieved by the provided solution.
   - This is because the maximum distance between any two cells in a single row is \( n-1 \), and all intermediate distances are also covered.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The program correctly outputs \( n \) points for each test case, and the format matches the problem's requirements.
   - However, there is an unnecessary `print(' ')` at the end of the program, which does not affect the correctness but is not needed.

### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The function `func` does not take any input parameters, but it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), representing the size of an n x n grid. The function should internally process a series of such test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 50).

- **State of the program after reading `t`:**
  - `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.

- **State of the program inside the while loop:**
  - For each test case, `t` is decremented by 1.
  - `n` is read as a positive integer representing the size of the grid for the current test case.

- **State of the program inside the for loop:**
  - For each integer `i` from 1 to `n`, the program prints the cell \((1, i)\).

- **State of the program after the for loop:**
  - The program prints an unnecessary space character.

- **State of the program after processing all test cases:**
  - `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), and `i` is `n`.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the program selects cells in the first row, which maximizes the set of distinct Manhattan distances.
- The set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is indeed \( \{1, 2, \ldots, n-1\} \), which is the maximum possible size for the given problem.
- The output format is correct, and the unnecessary `print(' ')` does not affect the correctness of the solution but is redundant.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct in terms of solving the problem as described. It maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for the given \( n \) and outputs the points in the correct format.

Final: **True**
