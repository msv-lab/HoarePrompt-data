Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 49).
   - `t` is now `t - 2`, but it is specified that `t` is at least 0. This means that `t` could be any integer from 0 to 47 (since subtracting 2 from 49 would make it 47, and it cannot go below 0).
   - `n` is a new input integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^3).
   - `i` is 3.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 3.
   - The `print` statement will simply print the value of `i`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **3**
