Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer with the constraint \(1 \le t \le 50\).
- `t` is now `t - 1`, meaning `t` has been decremented by 1.
- `n` is an input integer with the constraint \(2 \le n \le 10^3\).
- `i` is 3.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the string `'1'` with the `end` parameter set to `' '`. This means that after printing `'1'`, the cursor will remain on the same line, followed by a space.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not directly used in the `print` statement, so they do not affect the output of this specific line of code.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the string `'1'` followed by a space.

Output: **1 **
