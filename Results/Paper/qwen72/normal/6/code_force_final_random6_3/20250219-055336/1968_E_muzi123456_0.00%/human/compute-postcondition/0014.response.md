Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `t` is now `t - 1`. This means the value of `t` has been decremented by 1.
   - `n` is an input integer with the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
   - `i` is equal to `n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing a single space character.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not used in the `print` statement.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output a single space character.

Output: **' '**
