Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer with the constraint \(0 \leq t \leq 49\).
- `t` is now `t - 2` with the condition that `t` must be at least 0.
- `n` is a new input integer with the constraint \(3 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is 3.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the string `'1'` with the `end` parameter set to `' '`, which means that after printing `'1'`, the cursor will remain on the same line and add a space instead of moving to the next line.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints a constant string.

### Output:
The code snippet will print the string `'1'` followed by a space.

Output: **1 **
