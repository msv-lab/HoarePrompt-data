Reasoning:  
The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving an integer `n` that represents the size of an n x n grid. The goal is to choose `n` cells in the grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.

The program's strategy is to place all `n` cells in the first row of the grid, with each cell at a different column. This means the cells are placed at coordinates `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, ..., `(1, n)`.

However, this strategy does not maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The Manhattan distance between any two cells in the first row is simply the absolute difference between their column indices. For example, for `n = 4`, the cells are `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(1, 3)`, and `(1, 4)`. The set of distinct Manhattan distances is:

- `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`
- `|1-1| + |1-3| = 2`
- `|1-1| + |1-4| = 3`
- `|1-2| + |2-3| = 1`
- `|1-2| + |2-4| = 2`
- `|1-3| + |3-4| = 1`

Thus, the set of distinct Manhattan distances is `{1, 2, 3}`, which has a size of 3. However, for `n = 4`, it is possible to achieve a set of distinct Manhattan distances with a size of 6 by placing the cells more strategically. For example, placing the cells at `(1, 1)`, `(1, 3)`, `(4, 3)`, and `(4, 4)` would yield the set `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`.

Therefore, the program's strategy of placing all cells in the first row does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of `n`.
