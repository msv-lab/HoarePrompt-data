The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will start if `n` is at least 1, but since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once. The variable `i` will be set to 1 at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and is now `t - 1`.
- `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3).

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, and `i` will be set to 1 by the loop itself.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and is now `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), `i` is 1**
