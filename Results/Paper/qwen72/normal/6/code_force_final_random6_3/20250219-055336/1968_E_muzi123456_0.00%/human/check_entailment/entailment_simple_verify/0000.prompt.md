You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` does not take any input parameters, but it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), representing the size of an n x n grid. The function should internally process a series of such test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 50).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all potential cases. Specifically, the program always outputs points in the form \((1, i)\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n\). This means all points are on the same row, which results in a limited set of Manhattan distances.

For example, consider \(n = 3\). The program will output:
```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |1-2|, |1-1| + |1-3|, |1-1| + |2-1|, |1-1| + |2-3|, |1-1| + |3-1|\} = \{0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2\} = \{0, 1, 2\}
\]
The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 3, but it can be shown that the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\) is 4. A correct arrangement for \(n = 3\) that maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|2-2| + |1-3|, |2-3| + |1-1|, |2-3| + |3-1|\} = \{2, 1, 3\}
\]
Thus, the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 4, which is the maximum possible.

Therefore, the program does not always produce the correct output for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
