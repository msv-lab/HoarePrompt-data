The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 50). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) representing the size of an n x n grid. The function then prints a series of lines, each containing the number `1` followed by a space and the integer `i` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n`). After processing all test cases, the function ends with `t` being 0, `n` being the last input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), and `i` being `n`. The function does not return any value.
