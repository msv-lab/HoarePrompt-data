The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` 2, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to `i`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and is now `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), `i` is 2**
