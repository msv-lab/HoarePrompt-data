Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 49) and is now `t - 2` with `t` being at least 0, `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), `i` is `n`**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so it is now `t - 2` (since it was already `t - 1` in the initial state).
- The range for `t` is updated to 0 ≤ t ≤ 49 because it was originally 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and it has been decremented by 1.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
- The value of `i` remains `n`.
