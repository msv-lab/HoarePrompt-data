Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all potential cases. Specifically, the program always outputs points in the form \((1, i)\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n\). This means all points are on the same row, which results in a limited set of Manhattan distances.

For example, consider \(n = 3\). The program will output:
```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |1-2|, |1-1| + |1-3|, |1-1| + |2-1|, |1-1| + |2-3|, |1-1| + |3-1|\} = \{0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2\} = \{0, 1, 2\}
\]
The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 3, but it can be shown that the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\) is 4. A correct arrangement for \(n = 3\) that maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|2-2| + |1-3|, |2-3| + |1-1|, |2-3| + |3-1|\} = \{2, 1, 3\}
\]
Thus, the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 4, which is the maximum possible.

Therefore, the program does not always produce the correct output for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
