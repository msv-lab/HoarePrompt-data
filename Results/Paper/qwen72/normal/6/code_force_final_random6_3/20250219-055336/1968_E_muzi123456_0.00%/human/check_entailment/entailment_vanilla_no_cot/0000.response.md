Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. The program simply places all \(n\) points in the first row of the grid, which results in a limited set of Manhattan distances. Specifically, the distances will only be the differences in the \(y\)-coordinates, which are not sufficient to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the points should be placed in a way that covers a wide range of possible Manhattan distances. For example, placing points along the diagonal or using a more strategic pattern can help achieve this.

Here is a corrected version of the program that places points to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\):

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i <= n // 2:
                print(i, 1)
            else:
                print(1, i - n // 2 + 1)
        print(' ')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This version places points in a way that ensures a wider range of Manhattan distances, thus maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). For example, for \(n = 4\), it will place points at \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((1, 3)\), which will result in a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.
