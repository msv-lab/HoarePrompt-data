Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `nums` is a deque of n-1 or n positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9), `ans` is 0 or 1, `a` is the first element of the original `nums` deque, `b` is the last element of the original `nums` deque, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. `b` is greater than 0. If `a` > 0, `nums` has `a` added to the left, and if `k` is greater than or equal to 2 * `x`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`, `a` is updated to `a - x`, and `b` is updated to `b - x`. If `k` is less than 2 * `x`, `k` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a` is 0 or less, `ans` is set to 1 and `k` is less than 2 * `x`.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums.append(b)` adds the value of `b` to the right end of the deque `nums`.
- The length of `nums` is now either `n-1` or `n`, depending on whether it was `n-2` or `n-1` before the execution.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `ans`, `a`, `b`, `x`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions and relationships between the variables specified in the initial state still hold true.
