Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k < 10^15), `nums` is a deque containing exactly one positive integer (1 ≤ nums[0] ≤ 10^9), `ans` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ ans ≤ n), and `k` is greater than or equal to the single element in `nums`.**
