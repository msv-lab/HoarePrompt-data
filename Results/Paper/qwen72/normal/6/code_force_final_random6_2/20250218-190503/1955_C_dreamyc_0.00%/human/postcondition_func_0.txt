The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` (a positive integer, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers, 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9). It returns a non-negative integer `ans` which is between 0 and `n` (inclusive). The function reduces the values in `nums` by pairs, subtracting the minimum of each pair from `k` and the pair's elements until `k` is less than twice the minimum of any pair or `nums` has fewer than two elements. If, after this process, `k` is still positive and there is exactly one element left in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, the function returns `ans + 1`. Otherwise, it returns `ans`.
