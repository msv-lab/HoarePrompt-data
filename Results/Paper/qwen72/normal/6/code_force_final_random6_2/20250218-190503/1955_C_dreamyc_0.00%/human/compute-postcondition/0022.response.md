To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `k` and `len(nums)`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is non-zero and the length of `nums` is at least 2.

### Analysis:
1. **`k`**: The loop will execute as long as `k` is non-zero. If `k` is zero, the loop will terminate.
2. **`len(nums)`**: The loop will execute as long as the length of `nums` is at least 2. If the length of `nums` is less than 2, the loop will terminate.

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2.
- `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15).
- `nums` is a deque of `n-2` or `n-1` positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9).
- `ans` is 0, 1, or 2.
- `a` is the first element of the original `nums` deque.
- `b` is the last element of the original `nums` deque.
- `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.
- If `b` > 0 and `a` > 0, and `k` is greater than or equal to 2 * `x`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`, `a` is updated to `a - x`, and `b` is updated to `b - x`.
- If `b` > 0 and `k` is less than 2 * `x`, `k` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `b` > 0 and `a` is 0 or less, `ans` is set to 1 and `k` is less than 2 * `x`.
- If `b` is 0 or less, `ans` is set to 2.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`k`**: Since `k` is a positive integer and the loop will terminate if `k` is zero, `k` must be non-zero for the loop to execute one more time.
- **`len(nums)`**: The length of `nums` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time. Since `nums` is a deque of `n-2` or `n-1` positive integers, and `n` must be at least 2, `len(nums)` must be at least 2.

### Conclusion:
- `k` must be non-zero.
- `len(nums)` must be at least 2.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) and `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque of `n-2` or `n-1` positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9) and `len(nums)` must be at least 2, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `a` is the first element of the original `nums` deque, `b` is the last element of the original `nums` deque, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**
