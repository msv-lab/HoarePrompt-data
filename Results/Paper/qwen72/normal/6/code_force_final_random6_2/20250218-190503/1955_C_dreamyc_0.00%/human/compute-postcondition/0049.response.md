Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) and `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque of `n-3` or `n-4` positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9) and `len(nums)` must be at least 2, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `a` is the first element of the original `nums` deque, `b` is the last element of the original `nums` deque, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `b` > 0, then `nums` is a deque of `n-2` or `n-3` positive integers. If `a` > 0, then `a` is updated to `a - x`, `b` is updated to `b - x`, `x` is updated to the new minimum of `a` and `b`, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`. If `a` ≤ 0, then `ans` is 1. If `b` ≤ 0, then `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. In both cases, if `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, the updates to `a`, `b`, `x`, and `k` are performed. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
