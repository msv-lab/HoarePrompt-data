Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) and `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque of `n-3` or `n-4` positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9) and `len(nums)` must be at least 2, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `a` is the first element of the original `nums` deque, `b` is the last element of the original `nums` deque, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**

Explanation:
- `a` is assigned the value of the first element of the `nums` deque, which was originally the second element of `nums`.
- `b` is assigned the value of the last element of the `nums` deque, which was originally the second-to-last element of `nums`.
- The `nums` deque is updated by removing the first and last elements, so it now contains `n-3` or `n-4` elements, depending on whether it originally had `n-1` or `n-2` elements.
- The value of `x` remains the minimum of `a` and `b`, which are now the first and last elements of the original `nums` deque.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
