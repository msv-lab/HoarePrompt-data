You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`, followed by the durability of each ship.

2. **Deque Usage**: The program uses a deque to efficiently manage the ships, allowing for O(1) operations for popping from both ends and appending to both ends.

3. **Attack Simulation**:
   - The program simulates the Kraken's attacks by repeatedly removing the first and last ships from the deque.
   - It calculates the minimum durability between the first and last ships and reduces both by this amount, ensuring that the ship with the lower durability is sunk first.
   - If the remaining attacks `k` are sufficient to sink both ships, it updates the deque and the remaining attacks accordingly.
   - If the remaining attacks are not enough to sink both ships, it breaks out of the loop and handles the remaining ships and attacks.

4. **Single Ship Handling**: If only one ship remains and the Kraken still has enough attacks to sink it, the program correctly increments the count of sunk ships.

5. **Output**: The program prints the number of sunk ships for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

The program handles all edge cases and potential scenarios correctly, including:
- When the number of attacks `k` is less than the total durability of the ships.
- When the number of attacks `k` is exactly enough to sink all the ships.
- When the number of attacks `k` is more than the total durability of the ships.

Given the above analysis, the program is correct for all potential cases.
