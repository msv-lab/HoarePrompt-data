Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `nums` is a deque of n-2 or n-1 positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9), `ans` is 1 or 2, `a` is the first element of the original `nums` deque, `b` is the last element of the original `nums` deque, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. `b` is 0 or less.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1.
- Initially, `ans` is 0 or 1.
- After the increment, `ans` becomes 1 or 2.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `b` is 0 or less remains valid.
