#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and nums is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9).

    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k < 10^15), `nums` is a deque of 0 or 1 positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9), `ans` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ ans ≤ n).

        #The program returns the value of `ans` plus 1, where `ans` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ ans ≤ n) and `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2.
    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k < 10^15), `nums` is a deque of 0 or 1 positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9), `ans` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ ans ≤ n). Additionally, either `k` is 0, or `nums` has more than 1 element, or `k` is less than `nums[0]`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a non-negative integer `ans` which is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), where `n` is a positive integer at least 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` (a positive integer, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers, 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9). It returns a non-negative integer `ans` which is between 0 and `n` (inclusive). The function reduces the values in `nums` by pairs, subtracting the minimum of each pair from `k` and the pair's elements until `k` is less than twice the minimum of any pair or `nums` has fewer than two elements. If, after this process, `k` is still positive and there is exactly one element left in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, the function returns `ans + 1`. Otherwise, it returns `ans`.
