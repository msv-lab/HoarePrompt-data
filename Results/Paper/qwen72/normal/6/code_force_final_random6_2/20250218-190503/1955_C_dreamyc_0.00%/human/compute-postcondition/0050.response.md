Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k < 10^15), `nums` is a deque of 0 or 1 positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9), `ans` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ ans ≤ n).**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n`**: The initial number of elements in the deque `nums` remains a positive integer within the given range, but the loop will have reduced the length of `nums` to either 0 or 1 elements.
- **`k`**: The value of `k` will be non-negative, and it will be less than the initial value because the loop subtracts `2 * x` from `k` in each iteration where `k` is sufficient to perform the subtraction. If `k` becomes zero or insufficient to perform the subtraction, the loop will terminate.
- **`nums`**: The deque `nums` will contain either 0 or 1 elements after the loop has finished executing. This is because the loop continues to remove elements from both ends of the deque until either `k` is zero or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements.
- **`ans`**: The variable `ans` will be a non-negative integer, and its value will be the sum of the number of times an element was completely subtracted from `a` or `b` during the loop. The maximum value of `ans` will be `n` because each element in `nums` can be completely subtracted at most once.
