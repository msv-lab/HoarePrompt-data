### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of Kraken attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function converts the list `nums` into a deque to efficiently handle popping from both ends.
   - It initializes a counter `ans` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `k` is positive and there are at least two ships remaining.
   - It pops the first ship `a` and the last ship `b` from the deque.
   - It calculates the minimum durability `x` between the two ships.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, it reduces the durabilities of both ships by `x` and decreases `k` by `2 * x`.
   - If `a` still has positive durability after the attack, it is re-added to the deque. Otherwise, the ship is considered sunk, and `ans` is incremented.
   - Similarly, if `b` still has positive durability after the attack, it is re-added to the deque. Otherwise, the ship is considered sunk, and `ans` is incremented.

4. **Final Checks:**
   - If there is exactly one ship left and `k` is still positive, the program checks if `k` is greater than or equal to the remaining durability of the single ship.
   - If so, the ship is sunk, and `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - The function returns the total number of ships sunk.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 or 2 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is very large, ensuring that it does not perform unnecessary operations once all ships have sunk.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The use of a deque ensures that popping from both ends is efficient (O(1) operations).
   - The loop runs until either `k` is exhausted or there are fewer than two ships left, making the solution both time and space efficient.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the attacks in the specified order and correctly counts the number of ships sunk. The edge cases and the main loop logic are sound.

**Correctness: True**
