Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `nums` is a deque of n-2 positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9), `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element of the original `nums` deque, `b` is the last element of the original `nums` deque, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `k` is at least twice the value of `x`.**
