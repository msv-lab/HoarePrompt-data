The value of `xor` is updated to `xor ^ i`. Since `i` is the second element of `cur_arr` and `xor` was initially 0, `xor` now holds the value of `i`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, otherwise `new_arr` is a list containing the value `xor`, `xor` is `i`, and `thing1` is 0.**
