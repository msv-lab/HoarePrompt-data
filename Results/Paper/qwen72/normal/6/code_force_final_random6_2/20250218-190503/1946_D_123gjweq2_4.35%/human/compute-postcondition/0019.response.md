Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the value `i` if the bit at position `bit` in `i` is 0, otherwise `new_arr` is a list containing 0. `xor` is `i` if the bit at position `bit` in `i` was 0, otherwise `xor` is 0. `thing1` is 0.**
