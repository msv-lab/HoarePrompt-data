Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the value `i` if the bit at position `bit` in `i` is 0, otherwise `new_arr` is an empty list. `xor` is `i` if the bit at position `bit` in `i` was 0, otherwise `xor` is 0. `thing1` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `xor` is updated to `xor` XOR `i`.
- If the bit at position `bit` in `i` was 0, then `xor` becomes `i` (since `0 ^ i = i`).
- If the bit at position `bit` in `i` was 1, then `xor` becomes 0 (since `i ^ i = 0`).
- The other variables (`cur_arr`, `i`, `bit`, `new_arr`, `thing1`) remain unchanged.
