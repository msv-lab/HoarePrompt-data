Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the value `xor`, `xor` is `i`, and `thing1` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `new_arr.append(xor)` adds the value of `xor` to the list `new_arr`. Since `xor` is equal to `i`, which is the second element of `cur_arr`, `new_arr` now contains this value. The other variables remain unchanged.
