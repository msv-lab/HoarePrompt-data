Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is the result of `xor` XOR `i`, `thing1` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `xor` is updated to be the result of the XOR operation between its previous value (which was 0) and the value of `i` (which is the first element of `cur_arr`). The other variables remain unchanged.
