Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` that have a 0 at the `bit` position, `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`. Additionally, the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `thing1` is assigned the value returned by the function `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.
- The values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, `new_arr`, and `xor` remain unchanged.
- The bit at position `bit` in `xor` is still 0.
- `thing1` is now the result of the function call, which depends on the contents of `new_arr` and the value of `bit - 1`.
