You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

    return find_max(arr, 31)
    #The program returns the maximum integer value from the list 'arr', where all integers in 'arr' are between 0 and 2^30 - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `x`, but it does not use `x` in its execution. It returns the maximum integer value from the list `arr`, where all integers in `arr` are between 0 and 2^30 - 1. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the maximum value from `arr` is returned, and `x` remains unchanged.

If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, then `thing1` is -1. Otherwise, if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, then `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.
    if (x >> bit & 1) :

        #The program returns -1 or the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`, depending on whether the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1 or 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find_max` accepts a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` (0 <= bit < 30). It returns the number of elements in `cur_arr` if `bit` is -1. Otherwise, it processes the list to create a new list `new_arr` containing the XOR of elements in `cur_arr` that have a 0 at the `bit` position. If the bit at position `bit` in the final `xor` value is 1, it returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`. If the bit at position `bit` in the final `xor` value is 0, it returns -1 or the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`, depending on the bit at position `bit` in `xor`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number of segments \( k \) such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to \( x \).
   - The segments must be contiguous and cover the entire array from index 1 to \( n \).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(arr, x)`**:
   - This function calls `find_max(arr, 31)`.
   - The choice of 31 is likely because \( x \) is less than \( 2^{30} \), so the highest bit position to consider is 31 (0-indexed).

3. **Function 2: `find_max(cur_arr, bit)`**:
   - This function is a recursive function that processes the array `cur_arr` bit by bit, starting from the highest bit (31).
   - **Base Case**: If `bit` is -1, it returns the length of `cur_arr`, which means all bits have been processed.
   - **Recursive Case**:
     - It initializes `new_arr` to store the XOR results of segments that do not set the current bit.
     - It initializes `xor` to 0 to keep track of the current XOR result.
     - It iterates through `cur_arr` and updates `xor` with the current element.
     - If `xor` does not set the current bit (i.e., `xor >> bit & 1` is 0), it appends `xor` to `new_arr` and resets `xor` to 0.
     - After the loop, if `xor` still sets the current bit, it sets `thing1` to -1, indicating that no valid segment can be formed.
     - If `xor` does not set the current bit, it recursively calls `find_max` on `new_arr` with the next lower bit.
     - If the current bit of `x` is set (i.e., `x >> bit & 1` is 1), it returns the maximum of two values:
       - The result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)`, which processes the array without considering the current bit.
       - The length of `new_arr`, which represents the number of valid segments formed by ignoring the current bit.
     - If the current bit of `x` is not set, it returns `thing1`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The function `find_max` processes the array from the highest bit to the lowest bit, ensuring that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of the segments is checked against `x`.
   - The base case correctly returns the length of the array when all bits have been processed.
   - The recursive case correctly handles the splitting of the array into segments based on the current bit and ensures that the segments are valid.
   - The function correctly handles the case where no valid segments can be formed by setting `thing1` to -1.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the current bit of `x` is set by returning the maximum of two possible values.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function should handle cases where `x` is 0, and the array contains elements that are not 0.
   - The function should handle cases where the array contains only 0s.
   - The function should handle cases where the array is of length 1.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the given examples, the function should produce the correct outputs:
     - For `3 1` and `1 2 3`, the maximum \( k \) is 2.
     - For `2 2` and `1 1`, the maximum \( k \) is 2.
     - For `2 2` and `1 3`, the maximum \( k \) is 1.
     - For `2 3` and `0 0`, the maximum \( k \) is 2.
     - For `3 2` and `0 0 1`, the maximum \( k \) is 3.
     - For `4 2` and `1 3 3 7`, the maximum \( k \) is -1.
     - For `2 2` and `2 3`, the maximum \( k \) is -1.
     - For `5 0` and `0 1 2 2 1`, the maximum \( k \) is 2.

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the recursive splitting of the array and the bitwise operations as described in the problem statement.
