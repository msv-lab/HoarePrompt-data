Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the value `xor`, `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is 0.**

The code snippet `xor = 0` reassigns the variable `xor` to 0, overriding its previous value which was equal to the second element of `cur_arr`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
