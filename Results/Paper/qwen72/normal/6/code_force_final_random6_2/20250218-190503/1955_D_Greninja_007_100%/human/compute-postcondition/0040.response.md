Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It returns the number of times the sum of the minimum frequencies of the common elements between any contiguous subsequence of length `m` in list `a` and the list `b` is greater than or equal to `k`. The function does not modify the input lists `a` and `b`. **
