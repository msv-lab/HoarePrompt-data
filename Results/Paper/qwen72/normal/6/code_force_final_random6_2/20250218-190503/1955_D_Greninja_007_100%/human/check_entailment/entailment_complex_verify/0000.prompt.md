You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It returns the number of times the sum of the minimum frequencies of the common elements between any contiguous subsequence of length `m` in list `a` and the list `b` is greater than or equal to `k`. The function does not modify the input lists `a` and `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the elements in array `a` or `b` are not unique. Specifically, the logic for updating the `sm` variable (which tracks the number of matching elements) is flawed. When a new element `a[r]` is added to the sliding window, the program incorrectly increments `sm` if `ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]`, and similarly, when an element `a[r - m]` is removed from the window, it incorrectly decrements `sm` if `ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]`. This can lead to incorrect counts of matching elements.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
7 4 3
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4
```
The correct output should be `3`, as the good subsegments start at positions 1, 2, and 3. However, the program will output `4` because it incorrectly increments `sm` when the second `4` is added to the window, even though it was already counted in the initial window.

A correct implementation should carefully manage the counts of elements in the sliding window to ensure that each element is counted only once for the purpose of matching with elements in `b`.
