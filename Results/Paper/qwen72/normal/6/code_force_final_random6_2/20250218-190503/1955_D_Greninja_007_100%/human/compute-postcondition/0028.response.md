The only objects in the loop head are the variables `r`, `m`, and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `r` relative to `n`. If `r` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is `m + 1`, and `n` is such that `m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5`. For the loop to execute one more time, `r` is incremented by 1, so `r` becomes `m + 2`, and `n` must still be greater than `r`.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted first `m+1` elements of the list `a`. `r` is `m + 2`, `ca[a[r - m - 1]]` is decreased by 1, `ca[a[r]]` is increased by 1, `ca[a[r - m]]` is decreased by 1. If the original `sm` was greater than or equal to `k` and the new `sm` is still greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1. If the original `sm` was less than `k`, `ans` remains 0.**
