Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted first `m` elements of the list `a`, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of the common elements between the first `m` elements of `a` and `b`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
        sm += 1
    ca[a[r]] += 1
    if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
        sm -= 1
    ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted first `m+1` elements of the list `a`, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of the common elements between the first `m+1` elements of `a` and `b`, `ans` is 2 if `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, `r` is `m`, and `ca[a[r - m]]` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted first `m+1` elements of the list `a`. `r` is `m + 1`, `ca[a[r - m - 1]]` is decreased by 1, `ca[a[r]]` is increased by 1, `ca[a[r - m]]` is decreased by 1. If the original `sm` was greater than or equal to `k` and the new `sm` is still greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1. If the original `sm` was less than `k`, `ans` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted first `m+1` elements of the list `a`. `r` is `m + 2`, `ca[a[r - m - 1]]` is decreased by 1, `ca[a[r]]` is increased by 2, `ca[a[r - m]]` is decreased by 2. If the original `sm` was less than `k`, `ans` remains 0. If the original `sm` was greater than or equal to `k` and the new `sm` is still greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2. If the original `sm` was greater than or equal to `k` and the new `sm` is less than `k`, `ans` is 1. If the original `sm` was greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
