The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`.
- `m` is an integer representing the length of the list `b`.
- `k` is an integer that must be between 1 and `m` (inclusive) and `m` must be between 1 and `n` (inclusive), with `n` being at most 200,000.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 1,000,000 (inclusive).
- `b` is a list of `m` integers, where each integer `b_i` is between 1 and 1,000,000 (inclusive).

The function returns the number of times the sum of elements from list `a` (denoted as `sm`) was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.

Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It returns the number of times the sum of elements from list `a` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.**
