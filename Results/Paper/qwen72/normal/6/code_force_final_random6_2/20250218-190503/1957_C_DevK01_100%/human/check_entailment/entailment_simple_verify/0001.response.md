### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to determine the number of available positions for further moves.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - For each move `(a, b)`, the program checks if `a != b`:
     - If `a != b`, it means the computer will place a rook at `(b, a)`, which is a different position. Therefore, both positions `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are occupied, reducing the number of available positions by 2.
     - If `a == b`, it means the computer skips its turn, and only one position `(a, a)` is occupied, reducing the number of available positions by 1.
   - This logic is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to compute the number of different final configurations.
   - The dynamic programming (DP) approach is used to count the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`, which are the base cases for 0 and 1 available positions.
   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, the program updates the DP array using the formula:
     - `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]`
     - This formula accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the current configuration, considering the previous configurations.
   - The result is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers.
   - The use of a sliding window approach with `dp` (i.e., keeping only the last two elements) is efficient and correct.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of different final configurations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Validation Using Annotations:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5`.
  - This is correct as the program updates `n` based on the moves, and the initial value of `n` is within the specified range.

- **State of the program inside `func_1`:**
  - `dp` is initialized with `[1, 1]`, which are the base cases.
  - The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, updating `dp` using the correct formula and modulo operation.
  - After the loop, `dp` contains two elements: `[dp[n-1], dp[n]]`.
  - The function returns `dp[-1]`, which is `dp[n]`.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly processes the input and updates the number of available positions based on the moves.
- The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` is appropriate for counting the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the required range.
- The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state throughout its execution.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
