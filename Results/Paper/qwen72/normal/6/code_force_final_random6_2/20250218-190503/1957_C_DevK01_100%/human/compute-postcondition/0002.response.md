Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `dp` is a list with three elements: [1, 1, 3], `i` is 2**

Explanation:
- The code snippet modifies the list `dp` by appending a new element to it.
- The new element is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`.
- Initially, `dp` is [1, 1].
- `dp[-1]` is 1, and `dp[-2]` is also 1.
- `i` is 2, so `i - 1` is 1.
- The expression becomes `(1 + 2 * 1 * 1) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`, which simplifies to `(1 + 2) % 1000000007`, resulting in 3.
- Therefore, `dp` is updated to [1, 1, 3].
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `n` remains within the specified range.
