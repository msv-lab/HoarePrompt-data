Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `dp` is a list with three elements: [1, 3, 7], `i` is 3**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The list `dp` initially contains two elements: [1, 3].
- The value of `i` is 3.
- The new element added to `dp` is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`.
- `dp[-1]` is 3, `dp[-2]` is 1, and `i - 1` is 2.
- The calculation becomes `(3 + 2 * 2 * 1) % 1000000007`, which simplifies to `(3 + 4) % 1000000007` = 7.
- Therefore, `dp` is updated to [1, 3, 7].
- The value of `i` remains 3.
