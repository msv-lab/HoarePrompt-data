Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program initializes `n` to the size of the chessboard.
   - For each move, it checks if the move is on the diagonal (i.e., `a == b`). If it is, it decrements `n` by 1. If not, it decrements `n` by 2. This correctly accounts for the positions that are no longer available for placing rooks due to the moves and the computer's mirrored moves.

3. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to compute the number of possible final configurations.
   - It uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`, representing the base cases for a 0x0 and 1x1 board.
   - For each subsequent value of `i` from 2 to `n`, the program updates the DP array using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on an `i x i` board by considering the last row and column.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The program follows the problem description and constraints, and the dynamic programming approach used is appropriate for solving the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
