Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to update the number of available positions for placing rooks.

2. **Move Processing**:
   - For each move `(a, b)`, if `a != b`, it reduces `n` by 2 (since both `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are occupied).
   - If `a == b`, it reduces `n` by 1 (since only one position `(a, a)` is occupied).

3. **Dynamic Programming for Final Configurations**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `[1, 1]` to handle the base cases.
   - The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the DP array based on the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`.
   - The result is returned as `dp[-1]`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the result of `func_1(n)`.

The program correctly handles the constraints and the logic for placing rooks and calculating the number of possible final configurations. The dynamic programming approach ensures that the number of configurations is calculated efficiently and correctly for each test case. No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause the program to fail. Therefore, the program is correct.
