Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `lft = lst[:n]` creates a new list `lft` that contains the first `n` elements from the list `lst`. The values of `T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, and `lst` remain unchanged. The new list `lft` is derived from `lst` based on the value of `n`.
