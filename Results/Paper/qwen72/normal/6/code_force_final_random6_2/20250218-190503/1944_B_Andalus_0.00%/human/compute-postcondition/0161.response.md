To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for elem in ldb:
```

The objects in the loop head are `elem` and `ldb`. For the loop to execute, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, and `elem` will be the first element of `ldb` at the start of the loop.

Let's break down the given state and identify what needs to be adjusted:

- `T` is greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is `n-1`
- `lst` is a list of integers input by the user
- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`
- `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end
- `sz` is 0
- The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0
- `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element
- `sng` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if the next element exists)
- `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed
- `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element

For the loop to execute, `ldb` must be non-empty. The state of `elem` will be the first element of `ldb` when the loop starts. The other states do not directly affect the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is 0, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if the next element exists), `elem` is the first element in `ldb`, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element**
