Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index.
- `ldb` must contain at least three elements.
- `elem` is the third element in `ldb`.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `sz` remains 0.
- Otherwise, `sz` is increased by 2 if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2 and `sz` was initially less than `k`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`elem`**: According to the initial state, `elem` is the third element in the list `ldb`. Since `ldb` must contain at least three elements, `elem` is a well-defined value.
2. **`end=' '`**: The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Output Determination:
- The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.
- Since `elem` is the third element in `ldb`, the output will be `elem elem ` (with a space at the end).

### Final Output:
Output: **elem elem ** (where `elem` is the third element in the `ldb` list)
