Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, `ldb` must contain at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `ldb`, `sz` is increased by 2, and `sz` is now less than `k` if it was initially less than `k` and `k - sz` was greater than or equal to 2. If `sz` was initially greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `sz` remains 0.**
