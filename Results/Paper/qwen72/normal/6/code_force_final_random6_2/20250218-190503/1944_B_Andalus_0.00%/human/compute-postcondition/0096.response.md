The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `rdb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `rdb`. If `rdb` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `rdb` must have at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element in `rdb`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `rdb` must have at least three elements, and `elem` will be the third element in `rdb`.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`, `rdb` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`, and the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
