Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, `ldb` must contain at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `ldb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2 and `sz` was initially less than `k`, `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
