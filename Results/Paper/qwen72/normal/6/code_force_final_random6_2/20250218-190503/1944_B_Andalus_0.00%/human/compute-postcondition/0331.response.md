To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, and must have at least two elements.
   - `sz` is 2 if `k - sz` was greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `sz` remains 0.
   - The program has already printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice, separated by spaces.
   - The program has then printed elements from `sng` until `sz` reaches `k` or `sng` is exhausted.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - Otherwise, the program continues to print elements from `sng` until `sz` reaches `k` or `sng` is exhausted.

2. **Context of the `print` statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`.
   - This statement prints the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and does not move to a new line after printing.

3. **Determine the value of `elem`:**
   - The value of `elem` is not explicitly provided in the initial state. However, based on the context, `elem` is likely an element from either `ldb` or `sng`, depending on the current state of the program.
   - Since the program has already printed elements from `ldb` and `sng` up to a certain point, `elem` will be the next element from `sng` if `sng` is not exhausted and `sz` is less than `k`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space.
   - The exact value of `elem` depends on the current state of `sng` and `sz`.

Given the information, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the next element from `sng` if `sng` is not exhausted and `sz` is less than `k`)**
