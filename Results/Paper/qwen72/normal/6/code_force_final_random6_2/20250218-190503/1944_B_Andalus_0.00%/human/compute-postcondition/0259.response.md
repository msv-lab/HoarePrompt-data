Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is 2, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` (unchanged), `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`, `rdb` is an empty list, `ldb` remains an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, otherwise `sng` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code `sng.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `sng`.
- Since `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`.
- The condition `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]` is not specified, so we assume it is true for this step.
- Therefore, `sng` now contains the element `lft[i]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
