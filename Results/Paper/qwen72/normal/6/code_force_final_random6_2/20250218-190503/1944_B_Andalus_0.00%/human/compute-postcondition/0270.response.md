The code snippet `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the second element of the list `rgt` to the list `rdb`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and the second element of `rgt` is equal to the first element of `rgt`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, the second element of `rgt` is equal to the first element of `rgt`, `rdb` now contains the first element of `rgt`.**
