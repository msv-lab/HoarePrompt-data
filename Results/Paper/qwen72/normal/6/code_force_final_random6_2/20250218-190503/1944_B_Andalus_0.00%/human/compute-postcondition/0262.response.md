The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is 3, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` (unchanged), `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`, `rdb` is an empty list, `ldb` remains an empty list, and `sng` remains an empty list.**
