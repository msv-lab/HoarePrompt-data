Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `sz` is the total number of elements processed from `sng` (up to the point where `k - sz < 2`), the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if the next element exists), `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed, `rdb` now contains `rgt[i]`.**
