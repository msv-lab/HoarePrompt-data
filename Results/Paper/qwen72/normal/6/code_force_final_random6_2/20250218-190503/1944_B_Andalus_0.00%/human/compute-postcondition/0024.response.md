The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 2

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains the third element of `lft`, otherwise `ldb` remains an empty list. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[2]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list. `rdb` remains an empty list.**
