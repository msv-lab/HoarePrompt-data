To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context in which `elem` is defined:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.
   - `lst` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
   - `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element.
   - `sng` must be a non-empty list with at least one more element.
   - `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element.
   - `elem` is the next element in `sng` that will be processed.
   - `sz` is incremented by 1.
   - The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Understanding `elem`:**
   - `elem` is the next element in the list `sng` that will be processed.
   - Since `sng` is a non-empty list with at least one more element, `elem` will be the next element in this list.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space, without moving to a new line.

Given the initial state and the context, the output of the `print` statement will be the next element in the list `sng`.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the next element in the list sng)**
