Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2, `elem` is the last element in `ldb` that was processed. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus 1, `sng` must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus 2, `sng` must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `elem` is the third element in `sng`, `sng` must have at least 3 elements. `sz` is increased by 1. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
