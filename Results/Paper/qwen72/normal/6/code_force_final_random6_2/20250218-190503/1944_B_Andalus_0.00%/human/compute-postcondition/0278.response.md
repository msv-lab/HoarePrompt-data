Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index.**

### Explanation:
- **`i` is `n-1`**: The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), so after all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`.
- **`rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index**: The loop checks if the current element in `rgt` is equal to the previous element. If they are equal, the current element is appended to `rdb`. This process continues for all elements in `rgt` from index `1` to `n-1`.

The other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `sz`, `ldb`, and `sng`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
