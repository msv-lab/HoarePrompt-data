Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`. `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element. `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`. `rdb` remains an empty list.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `T` is still greater than 0.
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variables `n` and `k` are still the input integers.
- The list `lst` remains the list of integers input by the user.
- The list `lft` is still a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
- The list `rgt` is still a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.
- The variable `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The loop index `i` is `n-1`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations.
- The list `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element.
- The list `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`.
- The list `rdb` remains an empty list.
