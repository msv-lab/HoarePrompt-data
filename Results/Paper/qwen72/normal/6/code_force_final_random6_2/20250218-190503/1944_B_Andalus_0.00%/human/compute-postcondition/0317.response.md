Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`, the program has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice, separated by spaces, followed by the elements from `sng` until `sz` reaches `k` or `sng` is exhausted.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `i` remains at `n-1`.
- The variable `rdb` still contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index.
- The variable `sz` is now the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)` plus the number of elements that were printed from `sng`.
- The program has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice, separated by spaces, and then continued printing elements from `sng` until either `sz` reaches `k` or there are no more elements in `sng` to print.
