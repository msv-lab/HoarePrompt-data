Postcondition: ***`T` is `T - 1`, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is 3, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` (unchanged), `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`, `rdb` is an empty list. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `ldb` contains the element `lft[3]`, and `sng` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `ldb` remains an empty list, and `sng` is a list containing the fourth element of `lft` if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. If `i` is not less than `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` remains an empty list.***
