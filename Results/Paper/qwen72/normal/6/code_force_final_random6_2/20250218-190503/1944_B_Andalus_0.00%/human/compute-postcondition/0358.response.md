Output State: **The loop has completed all `T` iterations. `_` is `T-1`, `n` and `k` are the values from the last test case, `lst` is the list of integers from the last test case, `lft` and `rgt` are the sorted sublists from the last test case, `ldb` and `rdb` are the lists of duplicate elements from the last test case, `sng` is the list of single elements from the last test case, and `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `ldb` and `sng` or until `sz` reaches `k`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop has run for all `T` test cases, meaning the loop variable `_` has reached `T-1`.
- The variables `n` and `k` hold the values from the last test case.
- The list `lst` contains the integers from the last test case.
- `lft` and `rgt` are the sorted sublists of the first `n` and the last `n` elements of `lst`, respectively.
- `ldb` and `rdb` are lists containing the duplicate elements from `lft` and `rgt`, respectively.
- `sng` is a list containing the elements from `lft` that appear only once and are not equal to their preceding or succeeding elements.
- `sz` is the final value after processing elements from `ldb` and `sng` or until it reaches `k` for the last test case.
