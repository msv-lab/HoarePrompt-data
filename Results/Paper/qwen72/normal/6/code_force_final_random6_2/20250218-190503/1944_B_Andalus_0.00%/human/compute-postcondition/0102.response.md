Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element, `sz` is the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `sz` is the total number of elements processed from `rdb` (up to the point where `k - sz < 2`), `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed, and the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has finished executing all iterations.
- The variables `T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `i`, `ldb`, and `sng` remain unchanged from their initial values.
- The variable `sz` is updated to the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or to the total number of elements processed from `rdb` (up to the point where `k - sz < 2`).
- The variable `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed.
- The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0, ensuring that the loop condition was met or the loop terminated because `rdb` was exhausted.
