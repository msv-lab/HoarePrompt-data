The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute if `n` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `T` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, and the other variables are as described. However, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` must be 1 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
