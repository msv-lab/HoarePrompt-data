To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the `rgt` list.
- `rdb` contains elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, and must have at least three elements.
- `sz` is 4 if `k - sz` was greater than or equal to 2; otherwise, `sz` remains 2.
- The program has already printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice, separated by spaces, followed by elements from `sng` until `sz` reaches `k` or `sng` is exhausted.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`elem`**: The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, based on the context, it is likely that `elem` is an element from either `ldb` or `sng` that is being printed. Since the program has already printed elements from `ldb` and `sng` up to a certain point, `elem` is the next element to be printed.

2. **`end=' '`**: The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is not followed by a newline but by a space. This means that the elements will be printed on the same line, separated by spaces.

3. **Output Context**: The program has already printed some elements from `ldb` and `sng`. The `print` statement will add two more elements to the existing output, both of which are `elem`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end. The exact value of `elem` depends on the current state of the program, specifically the next element from `ldb` or `sng` that is being processed.

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the value of the next element from `ldb` or `sng` that is being printed)**
