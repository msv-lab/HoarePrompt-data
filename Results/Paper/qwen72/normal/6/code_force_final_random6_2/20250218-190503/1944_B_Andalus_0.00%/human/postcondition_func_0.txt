The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a list `a` of integers of length 2n (where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice) and an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. For each test case, it splits the list `a` into two equal halves, sorts them, and then prints pairs of duplicate elements from the first half and single elements from the first half until it has printed `k` elements. It then repeats the process for the second half, printing pairs of duplicate elements and single elements until it has printed `k` elements. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final state includes the sorted sublists and the lists of duplicate and single elements from the last test case.
