You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: `i` is `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `x - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes an implicit input `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` (2 <= x <= 1000) and prints the value `x - 1`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program state includes the number of test cases processed (`t`), and for each test case, the input integer `x` and the printed value `x - 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an integer \( x \) and need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the value \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( x \) and \( y \) is the largest integer that divides both \( x \) and \( y \) without leaving a remainder.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The provided program always sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \).
   - Let's consider why \( y = x - 1 \) might be a good choice:
     - The gcd of \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) is always 1, because \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) are consecutive integers, and consecutive integers are coprime (i.e., their gcd is 1).
     - Therefore, \( \gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x \).

3. **Maximizing the Expression:**
   - The expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized when \( y \) is as large as possible and \( \gcd(x, y) \) is 1.
   - Since \( y = x - 1 \) is the largest possible value for \( y \) (as \( y \) must be less than \( x \)), and it ensures that \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \), the value \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) will be \( x \), which is the maximum possible value.

4. **Checking the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \) and sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \).
   - It then prints \( y \).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \) for each test case.
   - This choice of \( y \) ensures that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized for the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct because it always finds a valid \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for the given constraints.
