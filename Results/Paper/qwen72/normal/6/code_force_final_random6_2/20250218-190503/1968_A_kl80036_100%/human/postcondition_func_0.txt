The function `func` processes an implicit input `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` (2 <= x <= 1000) and prints the value `x - 1`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program state includes the number of test cases processed (`t`), and for each test case, the input integer `x` and the printed value `x - 1`.
