Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 2, `y` is `x - 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `x` is updated to a new input integer, which is still greater than 2.
- The value of `y` is calculated as `x - 1`, where `x` is the new input integer greater than 2. Therefore, `y` is still one less than `x`.
