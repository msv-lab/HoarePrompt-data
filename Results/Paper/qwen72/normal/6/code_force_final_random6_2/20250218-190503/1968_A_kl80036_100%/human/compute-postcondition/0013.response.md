The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function is designed to work with an implicit or external input `t` which is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000. The function's output is not specified, but it is expected to process these inputs and return a result based on them.

Since the function definition does not include parameters, and the output is not provided, I will describe the functionality based on the given constraints:

Functionality: **The function processes an implicit input `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it processes an integer `x` (2 <= x <= 1000). The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs, but the specific output is not defined.**
