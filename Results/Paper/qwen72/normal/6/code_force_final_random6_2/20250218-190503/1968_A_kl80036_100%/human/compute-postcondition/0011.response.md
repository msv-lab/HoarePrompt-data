Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `x` is an input integer greater than 2.
   - `y` is `x - 1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(y)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `x` is defined as an input integer greater than 2. This means `x` can be any integer value such as 3, 4, 5, etc.
   - The variable `y` is defined as `x - 1`. Therefore, `y` will be one less than the value of `x`.

4. **Output:**
   - When the `print(y)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`.
   - Since `x` is an input integer greater than 2, `y` will be an integer greater than or equal to 2 (i.e., 2, 3, 4, etc.).

Output: **y (where y is x - 1 and x is an input integer greater than 2)**
