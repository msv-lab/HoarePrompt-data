Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `x` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `y` is defined as `x - 1`.

When the `print(y)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`.

Since `x` is an input integer greater than 0, the value of `y` will be one less than `x`.

Output: **y (where y is x - 1 and x is an input integer greater than 0)**
