### Reasoning:

The program is designed to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer \( t \) which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \) (where \( 2 \le x \le 1000 \)).

2. **Finding \( y \):**
   - The program sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \).
   - This choice of \( y \) is based on the observation that \( \gcd(x, x-1) \) is always 1 for any integer \( x > 1 \) because \( x \) and \( x-1 \) are consecutive integers, and the only common divisor they have is 1.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints \( y \) for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **GCD Calculation:**
  - For any \( x > 1 \), \( \gcd(x, x-1) = 1 \).
  - Therefore, \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x - 1) = x \).

- **Maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \):**
  - The value \( x \) is the maximum possible value for \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) when \( y \) is \( x - 1 \).
  - This is because \( y \) is the largest integer less than \( x \), and \( \gcd(x, y) \) is 1, which is the smallest possible GCD value for any \( y \) less than \( x \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly finds an integer \( y \) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized for each test case. The choice of \( y = x - 1 \) ensures that the sum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is always \( x \), which is the maximum possible value.
