Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Check**:
   - The program attempts to build a set `win` of characters seen in the string `s` and clears it once it contains all `k` characters. However, this approach does not check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.

2. **Generating a Missing Subsequence**:
   - The program generates a missing subsequence by appending characters to `ans` and then adding a character not in `win` and padding with 'a'. This approach does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid missing subsequence.

3. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The logic for checking if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s` is flawed. The program should generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and check if each of them is a subsequence of `s`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If any string is not a subsequence, print "NO" followed by that string.
4. If all strings are subsequences, print "YES".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(s, pattern):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in pattern)

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    alphabets = [chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)]
    all_possible_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product(alphabets, repeat=n)]
    
    for pattern in all_possible_strings:
        if not is_subsequence(s, pattern):
            print('NO')
            print(pattern)
            return
    print('YES')

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Generate All Possible Strings**:
   - `alphabets` is a list of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `all_possible_strings` is a list of all possible strings of length `n` formed using these alphabets, generated using `itertools.product`.

2. **Check Subsequences**:
   - The function `is_subsequence` checks if a given pattern is a subsequence of `s`.
   - For each pattern in `all_possible_strings`, it checks if the pattern is a subsequence of `s`.

3. **Output**:
   - If any pattern is not a subsequence, it prints "NO" followed by that pattern and returns.
   - If all patterns are subsequences, it prints "YES".

This approach ensures that the program correctly checks all possible strings and generates a valid missing subsequence if one exists.
