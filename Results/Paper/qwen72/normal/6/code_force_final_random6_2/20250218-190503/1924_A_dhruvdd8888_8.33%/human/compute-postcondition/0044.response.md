Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets, `win` is a set that may or may not contain any elements from `us`, `ans` is a list containing the characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`, `ps` is the number of times `win` reached a size of `k` and was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`. The loop has printed a string for each element in `us` that was not in `win` at the time of iteration, and `win` has been updated to include these elements.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variables `n`, `k`, `m`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are provided by the user input.
- The string `s` remains unchanged as it is provided by the user input.
- The set `us` still contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- The set `win` may or may not contain any elements from `us`, depending on the elements that were added during the loop iterations.
- The list `ans` contains the characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`.
- The variable `ps` is the number of times `win` reached a size of `k` and was cleared, and it is still less than `n`.
- The loop has printed a string for each element in `us` that was not in `win` at the time of iteration, and `win` has been updated to include these elements.
