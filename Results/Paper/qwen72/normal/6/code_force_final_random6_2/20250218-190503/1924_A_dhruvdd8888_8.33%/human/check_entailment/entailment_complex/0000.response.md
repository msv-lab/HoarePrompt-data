Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the input string `s`. If not, it should print a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Function Definition and Call:**
   - The function `func_1` is called without being defined with the necessary parameters. The function should be defined to accept `n`, `k`, and `s` as parameters.

2. **Logic for Subsequence Check:**
   - The program uses a set `win` to track the unique characters in the current window of the string `s`. However, this approach does not correctly check for all possible subsequences of length `n`.
   - The program only checks if the set `win` reaches a size of `k` and then clears it, which means it is only tracking the presence of `k` unique characters, not all possible subsequences of length `n`.

3. **Output for 'NO' Case:**
   - The program prints a string composed of the characters that formed the sequences, followed by a missing character, and padded with 'a' characters to reach a length of `n`. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

### Correct Approach:
- To correctly solve this problem, you need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
- If any of these strings is not a subsequence, print 'NO' and the string.
- If all possible strings are subsequences, print 'YES'.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for checking subsequences is flawed, and the output for the 'NO' case is not guaranteed to be a valid string that does not occur as a subsequence.

Correctness: **False**
