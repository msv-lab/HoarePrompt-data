The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, so the state of `i` changes to the next character in `s` at the start of each iteration. The length of `s` and the characters it contains are not modified by the loop head, so they remain the same.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is the first character in `s`, which is one of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
- `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should now be the second character in `s`.
- The length of `s` and the characters it contains remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input, with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and it is now updated to the user input string, which must have at least one character. `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. `i` is the second character in `s`, which is one of the first k lowercase English alphabets. `win` and `ans` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and `ps` also remains as it was.**
