You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters `n`, `k`, and `s`. `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and it is now updated to the user input string. `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. `win` is an empty set. `ans` is a list containing the characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`. `ps` is the number of times `win` reached a size of `k` and was cleared.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns None.
    #State: `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and it is now updated to the user input string. `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. `win` is an empty set. `ans` is a list containing the characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`. `ps` is the number of times `win` reached a size of `k` and was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets, `win` is a set that may or may not contain any elements from `us`, `ans` is a list containing the characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`, `ps` is the number of times `win` reached a size of `k` and was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`. The loop has printed a string for each element in `us` that was not in `win` at the time of iteration, and `win` has been updated to include these elements.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function is intended to accept parameters `n`, `k`, and `s`, but the provided function definition does not include these parameters. The function prints 'YES' and returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: The program prints 'YES' and returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
