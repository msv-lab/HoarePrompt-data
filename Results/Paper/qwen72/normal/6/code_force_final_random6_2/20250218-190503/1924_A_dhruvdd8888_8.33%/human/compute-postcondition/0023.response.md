Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and it must have at least 3 characters. `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. `i` is the third character in `s`, which is one of the first k lowercase English alphabets. `win` is a set that now contains the second character in `s` and the third character in `s` if `i` was in `us` and `len(win) != k`. If `i` was in `us` and `len(win) == k`, `win` is an empty set. `ans` is a list that now includes the second character in `s` if `i` was in `us` and `len(win) == k`, and `ps` is incremented by 1 if `i` was in `us` and `len(win) == k`. If `i` was not in `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.**
