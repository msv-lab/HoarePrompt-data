You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: The file opened by `open(0)` must have at least `t + 1` lines, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each line from the second to the `t + 1`-th line, `n` and `k` are integers obtained by splitting the line and converting the resulting strings to integers. The loop will have printed the result of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` for each of these lines.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads from a file (opened by `open(0)`) and processes each line starting from the second line. Each line is expected to contain two integers `n` and `k`. For each line, the function computes a value based on the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` and prints the result. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the file will have been read and the computed results will have been printed to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - The grid has a total of \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals (both main and anti-diagonals).

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it takes two integers \( n \) and \( k \).
   - The program then calculates the minimum number of cells to color using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \left(\frac{k}{2} + k \mod 2\right) \times (k < 4n - 3) + 2n \times (k \geq 4n - 3) + (k == 4n - 2)
     \]

3. **Breaking Down the Formula:**
   - \(\frac{k}{2} + k \mod 2\): This part calculates the ceiling of \( \frac{k}{2} \). It ensures that if \( k \) is odd, we add 1 to the result of \( \frac{k}{2} \).
   - \((k < 4n - 3)\): This is a boolean condition that checks if \( k \) is less than \( 4n - 3 \). If true, it multiplies the ceiling of \( \frac{k}{2} \) by 1, otherwise by 0.
   - \(2n \times (k \geq 4n - 3)\): This part checks if \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( 4n - 3 \). If true, it multiplies \( 2n \) by 1, otherwise by 0.
   - \((k == 4n - 2)\): This is a boolean condition that checks if \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \). If true, it adds 1 to the result, otherwise it adds 0.

4. **Evaluating the Formula:**
   - If \( k < 4n - 3 \), the formula simplifies to \(\left(\frac{k}{2} + k \mod 2\right)\), which is the ceiling of \( \frac{k}{2} \).
   - If \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), the formula simplifies to \(2n + (k == 4n - 2)\).
     - If \( k = 4n - 2 \), the result is \(2n + 1\).
     - If \( k = 4n - 3 \), the result is \(2n\).

5. **Checking the Examples:**
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \):
     - \( k < 4n - 3 \) is true.
     - \(\left(\frac{4}{2} + 4 \mod 2\right) = 2 + 0 = 2\).
     - Output: 2 (Correct)
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \):
     - \( k < 4n - 3 \) is true.
     - \(\left(\frac{3}{2} + 3 \mod 2\right) = 1 + 1 = 2\).
     - Output: 2 (Correct)
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \):
     - \( k \geq 4n - 3 \) is true.
     - \(2n + (k == 4n - 2) = 6 + 0 = 6\).
     - Output: 6 (Correct)
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 9 \):
     - \( k \geq 4n - 3 \) is true.
     - \(2n + (k == 4n - 2) = 6 + 0 = 6\).
     - Output: 5 (Incorrect, should be 6)
   - For \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 7 \):
     - \( k < 4n - 3 \) is true.
     - \(\left(\frac{7}{2} + 7 \mod 2\right) = 3 + 1 = 4\).
     - Output: 4 (Correct)
   - For \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 11 \):
     - \( k < 4n - 3 \) is true.
     - \(\left(\frac{11}{2} + 11 \mod 2\right) = 5 + 1 = 6\).
     - Output: 6 (Correct)
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \):
     - \( k < 4n - 3 \) is true.
     - \(\left(\frac{3}{2} + 3 \mod 2\right) = 1 + 1 = 2\).
     - Output: 2 (Correct)

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles the cases where \( k < 4n - 3 \).
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( k = 4n - 2 \).
   - However, the program incorrectly handles the case where \( k = 4n - 3 \). It should output \( 2n \), but it outputs \( 2n - 1 \).
