#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: The file opened by `open(0)` must have at least `t + 1` lines, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each line from the second to the `t + 1`-th line, `n` and `k` are integers obtained by splitting the line and converting the resulting strings to integers. The loop will have printed the result of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` for each of these lines.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads from a file (opened by `open(0)`) and processes each line starting from the second line. Each line is expected to contain two integers `n` and `k`. For each line, the function computes a value based on the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` and prints the result. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the file will have been read and the computed results will have been printed to the console.
