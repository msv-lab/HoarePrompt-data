The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k`, with the constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and is determined based on the values of `n` and `k`.
