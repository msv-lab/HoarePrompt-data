Functionality: ** The function reads from a file (opened by `open(0)`) and processes each line starting from the second line. Each line is expected to contain two integers `n` and `k`. For each line, the function computes a value based on the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` and prints the result. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the file will have been read and the computed results will have been printed to the console. **
