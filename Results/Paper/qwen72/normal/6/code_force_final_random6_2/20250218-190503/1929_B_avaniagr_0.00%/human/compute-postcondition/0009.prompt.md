Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    n, k = map(int, s.split())
    print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (
        k == 4 * n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The file opened by `open(0)` must have at least two lines, `s` is the second line of the file, `n` and `k` are integers obtained by splitting the second line of the file and converting the resulting strings to integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The file opened by `open(0)` must have at least three lines, `s` is the third line of the file, `n` and `k` are integers obtained by splitting the third line of the file and converting the resulting strings to integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The file opened by `open(0)` must have at least four lines, `s` is the fourth line of the file, `n` and `k` are integers obtained by splitting the third line of the file and converting the resulting strings to integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
