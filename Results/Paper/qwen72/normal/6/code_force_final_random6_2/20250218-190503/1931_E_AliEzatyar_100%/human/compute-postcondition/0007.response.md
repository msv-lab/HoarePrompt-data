The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `num`. The loop iterates backward from `len(num) - 1` to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(num) - 1` and `len(num)` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, and `len(num)` must still be greater than 0. However, since `i` is already at `len(num) - 1`, the next value of `i` will be `len(num) - 2`.

State: **`num` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(num) <= 2 * 10^5, and each integer a_i in num satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `counter` is 1 if the last element of `num` (i.e., `num[i]`) is '0', otherwise `counter` is 0; `i` is `len(num) - 2` and `len(num)` must be greater than 1.**
