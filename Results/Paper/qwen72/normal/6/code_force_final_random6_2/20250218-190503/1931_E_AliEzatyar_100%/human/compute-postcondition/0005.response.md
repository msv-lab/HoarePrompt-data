Output State: **`num` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(num) <= 2 * 10^5, and each integer a_i in num satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `counter` is 0; `i` is `len(num) - 1` and `len(num)` must be greater than 0; the last element of `num` is not 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
