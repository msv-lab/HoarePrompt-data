Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to count the number of trailing zeros in a number. However, the logic of the game involves reversing the digits of the number, not just counting trailing zeros. The function `func_1` is not used correctly in the context of the game.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `subtract_zero`**:
   - The variable `subtract_zero` is supposed to be used to adjust the total number of digits, but the logic for how it is calculated is flawed. The program is subtracting the number of trailing zeros in pairs, which does not align with the game's rules.

3. **Incorrect Condition for Sasha's Win**:
   - The condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:` is not correct. The game's win condition is based on the final number being greater than or equal to \(10^m\), not on the total number of digits after some adjustment.

### Correct Approach:

To determine the winner, we need to consider the following:

- **Anna's Turn**: Anna reverses the digits of a single number. This operation does not change the total number of digits in the list.
- **Sasha's Turn**: Sasha concatenates two numbers, reducing the list size by one. The goal is to make the final concatenated number greater than or equal to \(10^m\).

The key to solving this problem is to realize that the final number will be the concatenation of all the numbers in the list, and the order of concatenation can be optimized to maximize the final number. If the total number of digits in the list is greater than or equal to \(m\), Sasha can always win by concatenating the numbers in a way that the final number is at least \(10^m\).

### Corrected Program:

```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = sum(len(item) for item in array)
    
    # If the total number of digits is greater than or equal to m, Sasha can win
    if total_digits >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

- **Total Digits Calculation**: We calculate the total number of digits in the list by summing the lengths of all the numbers.
- **Win Condition**: If the total number of digits is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\), Sasha can always win by concatenating the numbers in a way that the final number is at least \(10^m\). Otherwise, Anna wins because the final number will be less than \(10^m\).

This corrected program should correctly determine the winner for each test case based on the problem description.
