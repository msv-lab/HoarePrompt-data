Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, `_` is less than `t` and incremented by 1, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`, `max` retains its initial value if `temp[1]` was not greater than the initial value of `max`, otherwise `max` is updated to `temp[1]`.**
