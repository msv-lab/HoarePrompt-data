Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(min(a))
        continue
    max = 0
    for i in range(n - 2):
        temp = a[i:i + 3]
        temp.sort()
        if temp[1] > max:
            max = temp[1]
    print(max)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is `n-3`, and `max` is the maximum value among the second largest elements of all possible sorted sublists of length 3 in `a`. If `n` is 2, `max` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `n-3`, `_` is less than `t`, `max` is the maximum value among the middle elements of all sorted sublists of `a` of length 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `n-3`, `_` is less than `t` and incremented by 1, `max` is the maximum value of the middle element in any sorted sub-list of 3 consecutive elements in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
