Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the length of the array `n` is greater than 2 but the subarray length is not 3. According to the problem description, Mocha can choose any subarray of length `l` to `r` where `1 <= l < r <= n`. The program only considers subarrays of length 3, which is a specific case and not a general solution. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The program will output `3`, but the correct answer should be `4` as shown in the problem description. The program fails to consider subarrays of length greater than 3, which can lead to a higher median value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
