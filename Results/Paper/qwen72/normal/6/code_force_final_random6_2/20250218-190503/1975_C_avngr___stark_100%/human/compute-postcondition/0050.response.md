Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 2, `_` is less than `t`, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `a[i+2]` in ascending order, and `max` is the maximum value between the initial `max` and `temp[1]`. If `temp[1]` > `max`, then `max` is updated to `temp[1]`.***
