Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an input integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.
   - `i` is \(n-3\).
   - `max` is the maximum value among the second largest elements of all possible sorted sublists of length 3 in `a`.
   - `_` is less than `t`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(min(a))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(min(a))` statement will print the minimum value in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` is derived from the input and contains integers. The exact values of these integers are not specified, but we know that `a` is a list of integers and its length is `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the exact values of the integers in the list `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the list `a`.
   - The minimum value in the list `a` will be printed.

Output: **min(a) (where min(a) is the minimum value in the list a)**
