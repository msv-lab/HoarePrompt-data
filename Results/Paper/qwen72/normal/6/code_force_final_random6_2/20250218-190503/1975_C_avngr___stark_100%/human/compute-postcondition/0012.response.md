Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `max` is 0, `i` is 0, `temp` is a sorted list containing the first 3 elements of `a` if `n` is at least 3, otherwise `temp` is an empty list. The second element of `temp` is greater than `max`.**
