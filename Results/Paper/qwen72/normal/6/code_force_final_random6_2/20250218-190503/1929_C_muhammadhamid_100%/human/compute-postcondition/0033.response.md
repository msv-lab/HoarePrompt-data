Output State: **_ is t - 1, `k` and `a` are integers, `x` is an integer, `s` is the result of the expression `1 + sum((s // (k - 1) + 1) for _ in range(x))` after `x` iterations, `i` is `x - 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `_` will be `t - 1` because it is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the outer loop, starting from 0. The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` will retain their values as integers, which are provided by the user input for each test case. The variable `s` will have the final value after `x` iterations of the inner loop, where the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is applied starting from `s = 1`. The variable `i` will be `x - 1` because it is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the inner loop, starting from 0, and the loop runs `x` times. The final value of `s` is used to determine whether `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, and the result is printed as either 'Yes' or 'No'.
