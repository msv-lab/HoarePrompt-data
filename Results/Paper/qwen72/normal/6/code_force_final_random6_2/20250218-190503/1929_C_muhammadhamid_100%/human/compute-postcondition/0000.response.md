The loop head contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
