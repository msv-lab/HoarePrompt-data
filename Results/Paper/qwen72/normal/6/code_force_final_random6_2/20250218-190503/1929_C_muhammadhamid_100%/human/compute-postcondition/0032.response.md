Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 1 (this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `k` is the first integer from user input.
   - `x` is the second integer from user input and must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `a` is the third integer from user input.
   - `s` is the result of the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` executed `x` times starting from `s = 2`.
   - `i` is `x - 1` (this variable is not used in the code snippet).

2. **Expression for `s`:**
   - The expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is executed `x` times starting with `s = 2`.
   - This means `s` is updated `x` times using the formula `s = s + s // (k - 1) + 1`.

3. **Determine the value of `s` after `x` iterations:**
   - Let's break down the formula:
     - `s // (k - 1)` performs integer division of `s` by `k - 1`.
     - `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` updates `s` by adding the result of the integer division and 1.
   - We need to execute this `x` times to find the final value of `s`.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `k = 3` and `x = 2`:
     - Initial `s = 2`.
     - After the first iteration: `s = 2 + 2 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4`.
     - After the second iteration: `s = 4 + 4 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7`.
   - So, for `k = 3` and `x = 2`, `s` becomes 7.

5. **Condition for the `print` statement:**
   - The `print` statement checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints 'Yes'.
   - If `a < s`, it prints 'No'.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The output depends on the values of `a` and `s` after `x` iterations.
   - Since the exact values of `k` and `x` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` (where `s` is the result of the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` executed `x` times starting from `s = 2`), otherwise 'No'**.
