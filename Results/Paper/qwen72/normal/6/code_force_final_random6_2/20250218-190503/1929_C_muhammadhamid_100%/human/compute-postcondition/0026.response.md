Output State: **`_` is 1, `k` is the first integer from user input, `x` is the second integer from user input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the third integer from user input, `s` is 2, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated by the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. Initially, `s` is 1. The expression `s // (k - 1)` will be 0 for any integer `k` greater than 1, because the integer division of 1 by any positive integer is 0. Therefore, `s` becomes `1 + 0 + 1`, which is 2. The values of `_`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
