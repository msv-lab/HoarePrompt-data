Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem by following these steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums` for each book.
3. It sorts the list `nums` in descending order.
4. It prints the sum of the two largest numbers in the sorted list, which corresponds to the maximum number of pages Alice can read by putting the books with the two highest page counts in different piles.

This approach ensures that the two books with the most pages are always in different piles, thus maximizing the number of pages Alice can read. The program handles the constraints and input format as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
