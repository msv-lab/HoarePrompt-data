The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, sorted in descending order.**
