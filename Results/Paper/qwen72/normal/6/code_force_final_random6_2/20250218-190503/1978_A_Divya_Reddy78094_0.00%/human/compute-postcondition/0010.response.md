Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet).
   - `_` is 1 (though `_` is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is an input integer (though `n` is not used in the code snippet).
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(nums[0] + nums[1])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. This means the first element `nums[0]` is the largest integer in the list, and the second element `nums[1]` is the second largest integer in the list.
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of the first and second elements of the list `nums`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `nums` is sorted in descending order, the first element `nums[0]` is the largest integer, and the second element `nums[1]` is the second largest integer.
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of these two largest integers.

Output: **nums[0] + nums[1] (where nums[0] is the largest integer in the list and nums[1] is the second largest integer in the list)**
