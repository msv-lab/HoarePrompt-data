Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of pages in each book for a test case.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to include the parameters as described. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing the number of pages in the books for a test case.
