### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find the highest bit position that is set in the binary representation of `k`. This is used to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - The function iterates through the bits of `k` by right-shifting `k` until it becomes 0, counting the number of shifts. This effectively counts the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`.
   - The function returns `position - 1`, which is the highest bit position set in `k`.

2. **Main Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is greater than 1:
     - It calls `func_1(k)` to get the highest bit position set in `k`.
     - It appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the array `arr`. This value is the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position found.
     - It appends `k - arr[-1]` to `arr` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.
     - It appends `0` to `arr` for the remaining `n-2` elements.
     - It prints the array `arr`.
   - If `n` is 1:
     - It simply prints `k`.

3. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the case where `k` is 0 by returning -1, but this case is not possible given the constraints \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
   - The main program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1 by printing `k`.
   - For `n > 1`, the program ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined with a single parameter `n`, but it should be `k` based on the problem description.
   - The function `func_1` should return `position - 1` to get the highest bit position set in `k`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the function parameter and the function name, the program is incorrect. The function `func_1` should be defined with `k` as the parameter, and the function name should be consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
