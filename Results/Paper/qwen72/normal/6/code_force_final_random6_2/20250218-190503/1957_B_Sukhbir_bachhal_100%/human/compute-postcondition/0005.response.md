The value of `n` is right-shifted by 1 bit, which is equivalent to dividing `n` by 2 and truncating the result to an integer. The value of `k` remains unchanged, and `position` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `n` is not equal to 0, `position` is 0**
