Output State: **`T` is an input integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4) decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer), `k` is the second integer from the input split by space, the function should take three parameters: `T`, a list of pairs `(n, k)`, and a list of lists `a`. Each pair `(n, k)` in the list of pairs consists of integers (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15) representing the number of ships and the number of attacks by the Kraken, respectively. Each list in `a` contains `n` integers (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the durability of the ships. The length of the list of pairs and the list of lists `a` should be equal to the original `T`. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
