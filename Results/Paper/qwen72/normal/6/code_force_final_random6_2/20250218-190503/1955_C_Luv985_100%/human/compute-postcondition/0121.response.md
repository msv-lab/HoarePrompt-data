Output State: **`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between the original `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the update.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `2 * mi` from its current value.
- The values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` are already updated by subtracting `mi` from their original values.
- The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
- The value of `mi` remains the same as it was before the update, which is the minimum value between the original `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the update.
