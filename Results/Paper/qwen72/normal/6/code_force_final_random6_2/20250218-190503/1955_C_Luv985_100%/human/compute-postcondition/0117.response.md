The loop condition is `l < r and k > 0`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `l`, `r`, and `k` so that both conditions are met.

1. **Adjusting `l` and `r`:**
   - `l` is 0 or 1.
   - `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 3`.
   - For `l < r` to be true, `l` must be less than `r`. If `l` is 0, `r` must be at least 1. If `l` is 1, `r` must be at least 2.

2. **Adjusting `k`:**
   - `k` is greater than 0 or `k - 2 * mi`.
   - For `k > 0` to be true, `k` must be greater than 0.

Given the current state:
- `l` is 0 or 1.
- `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 3`.
- `k` is greater than 0 or `k - 2 * mi`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
- If `l` is 0, `r` must be at least 1.
- If `l` is 1, `r` must be at least 2.
- `k` must be greater than 0.

Since `l` is 0 or 1 and `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 3`, the condition `l < r` will be satisfied if `n` is at least 3. Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0.

State: **`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` must be greater than 0**
