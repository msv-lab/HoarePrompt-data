Output State: **`T` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4) decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer), `k` is the second integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer), `a` is a list of integers representing the input split by spaces, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation:
- `r` is assigned the value of `n - 1`.
- The value of `n` is the first integer from the input split by space.
- The other variables (`T`, `k`, `a`, `l`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
