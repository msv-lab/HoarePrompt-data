Postcondition: ***`l` is equal to `r` or `l` is greater than `r`, `k` is 0 or less than 2, `ans` is the total number of elements in `a` that have been reduced to 0 during the loop execution. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. `a` is a list of integers where elements that have been reduced to 0 are 0, and the remaining elements are non-zero. `T` is decreased by the number of iterations the loop ran.***
