Output State: **`T` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4) decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer), `k` is the second integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer), `a` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The value of `T` remains unchanged as an input integer decreased by 1.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as the first integer from the input split by space.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged as the second integer from the input split by space.
- The variable `a` is now a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces.
