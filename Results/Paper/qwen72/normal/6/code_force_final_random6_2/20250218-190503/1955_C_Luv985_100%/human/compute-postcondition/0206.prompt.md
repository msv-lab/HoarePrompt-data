Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer, the function should take three parameters: `T`, a list of pairs `(n, k)`, and a list of lists `a`. `T` is an integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each pair `(n, k)` in the list of pairs consists of integers (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15) representing the number of ships and the number of attacks by the Kraken, respectively. Each list in `a` contains `n` integers (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the durability of the ships. The length of the list of pairs and the list of lists `a` should be equal to `T`. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *The loop has completed all its iterations. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `k >= a[l]` is True; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *The loop has completed all its iterations. `l` is 0 or a value greater than 0 but less than or equal to `n - 1`, and `r` is `n - 1` or a value less than `n - 1` but greater than or equal to 0. `k` is 0 or a positive integer less than the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` multiplied by 2. `ans` is the total number of elements in `a` that have been reduced to 0 during the loop's execution. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`l` is equal to `r` or `l` is greater than `r`, `k` is 0 or less than 2, `ans` is the total number of elements in `a` that have been reduced to 0 during the loop execution. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. `a` is a list of integers where elements that have been reduced to 0 are 0, and the remaining elements are non-zero. `T` is decreased by the number of iterations the loop ran.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
