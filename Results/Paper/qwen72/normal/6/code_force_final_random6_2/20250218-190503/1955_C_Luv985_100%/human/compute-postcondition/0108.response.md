Postcondition: ***`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` or `a[n - 2]` depending on the value of `r`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`. If `a[l]` was 0, then `l` is 1 and `ans` is `ans + 1`. Otherwise, `l` remains 0.***
