Postcondition: ***`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is greater than 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[0]` is reduced by `mi`, and `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is set to `n - 2` and `ans` is increased by 1. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is set to 1 and `ans` is increased by 1. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, `t` is `k % 2`. If `a[l] - t - k // 2` is 0, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
