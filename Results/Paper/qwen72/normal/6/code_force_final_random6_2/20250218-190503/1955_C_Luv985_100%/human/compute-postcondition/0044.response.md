Output State: **`T` is an input integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4) decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 1), `k` is the second integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 0), `a` is a list of integers representing the input split by spaces, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `t` is `k % 2`.**

The variable `t` is assigned the value of `k % 2`, which is the remainder when `k` is divided by 2. The value of `t` will be 0 if `k` is even, and 1 if `k` is odd. All other variables remain unchanged.
