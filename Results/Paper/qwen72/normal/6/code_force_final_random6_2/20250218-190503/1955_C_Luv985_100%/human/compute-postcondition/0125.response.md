Output State: **`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between the original `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the update, `ans` is `ans + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The values of `l`, `r`, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, and `mi` remain unchanged from their initial values. The initial conditions for `l`, `r`, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, and `mi` are still valid, and `ans` is now one more than its previous value.
