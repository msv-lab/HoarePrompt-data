Output State: **`T` is an input integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4) decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer), `k` is the second integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer), `a` is a list of integers representing the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code snippet converts each element in the list `a` from a string to an integer. The initial state indicates that `a` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces. After the code executes, `a` becomes a list of integers, where each integer is the result of converting the corresponding string element. The values of `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
