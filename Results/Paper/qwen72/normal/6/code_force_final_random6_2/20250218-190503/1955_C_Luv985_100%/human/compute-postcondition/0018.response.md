Postcondition: **`T` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4) decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 1), `k` is the second integer from the input split by space minus `2 * mi` (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 0), `a` is a list of integers representing the input split by spaces, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `a[n - 1]` is now `a[n - 1] - mi`. Additionally, the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is 0.**
