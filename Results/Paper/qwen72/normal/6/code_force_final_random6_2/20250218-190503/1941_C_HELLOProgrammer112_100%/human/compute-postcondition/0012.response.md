Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`, `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in the new `s`.**

The code snippet `z = s.count('mapie')` updates the value of `z` to the number of times the substring 'mapie' appears in the string `s`. The values of `int(input())`, `_`, `a`, `s`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
