Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This is a precondition that ensures the input is a positive integer.
   - `_` is 0. This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.
   - `a` is an input integer greater than 0. This variable is also not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.
   - `s` is an input string. This string will be used to count occurrences of specific substrings.
   - `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`.
   - `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.
   - `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(x + y - z)`.
   - We need to determine the value of `x + y - z`.

3. **Calculating the Values:**
   - `x` is the count of the substring 'map' in `s`.
   - `y` is the count of the substring 'pie' in `s`.
   - `z` is the count of the substring 'mapie' in `s`.

4. **Understanding the Calculation:**
   - `x` counts the occurrences of 'map'.
   - `y` counts the occurrences of 'pie'.
   - `z` counts the occurrences of 'mapie'.
   - The expression `x + y - z` will add the counts of 'map' and 'pie' and then subtract the count of 'mapie'.

5. **Example Reasoning:**
   - If `s` is "mapmapiepie", then:
     - `x` (count of 'map') = 2
     - `y` (count of 'pie') = 2
     - `z` (count of 'mapie') = 1
     - `x + y - z` = 2 + 2 - 1 = 3

6. **General Output:**
   - The print statement will output the result of the expression `x + y - z`, which is the sum of the number of times 'map' and 'pie' appear in `s` minus the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`.

Output: **x + y - z (where x is the number of times 'map' appears in s, y is the number of times 'pie' appears in s, and z is the number of times 'mapie' appears in s)**
