You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        z = s.count('mapie')
        print(x + y - z)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` (which is not used in the function) and a string `s`. The function then calculates the number of times the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' appear in `s`, and prints the result of `x + y - z` for each test case, where `x` is the count of 'map', `y` is the count of 'pie', and `z` is the count of 'mapie'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of characters to delete from a string to make it beautiful.
   - A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - If a string contains both "pie" and "map" as a single substring "mapie", we should only count this once to avoid overcounting.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself.
   - It then counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string.
   - It also counts the occurrences of the substring "mapie".
   - Finally, it prints the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie" minus the count of "mapie".

3. **Logical Flaws**:
   - The program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly handle the overlapping cases of "map" and "pie".
   - For example, if the string is "mappie", the program will count "map" once and "pie" once, but it will not correctly handle the overlap.
   - The program should instead use a more sophisticated approach to find the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "pie" and "map".

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to iterate through the string and identify the positions of "pie" and "map".
   - For each occurrence, we need to determine the minimum number of deletions required to remove the substring.
   - We should also handle overlapping cases correctly.

5. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the string "mmapnapie", the program outputs 2, which is correct because we can delete the 4th and 9th characters to remove "map" and "pie".
   - For the string "azabazapi", the program outputs 0, which is correct because the string does not contain "pie" or "map".
   - For the string "mappppie", the program outputs 2, which is correct because we can delete the 1st and 7th characters to remove "map" and "pie".
   - For the string "mapmapmapmapmapmap", the program outputs 6, which is incorrect because the correct answer should be 12 (each "map" and "pie" should be counted separately).

Given the logical flaws in the program, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
