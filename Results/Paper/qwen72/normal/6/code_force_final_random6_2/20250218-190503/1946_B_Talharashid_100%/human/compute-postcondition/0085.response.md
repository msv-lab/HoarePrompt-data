The function `max_sum_after_operations` accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `a` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
- `k` is an integer representing the number of operations (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5).
- `a` is a list of integers (−10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

The sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns the maximum possible sum of the array `a` after performing `k` operations, where each operation consists of incrementing any element of the array by 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. It returns the maximum possible sum of the array `a` after performing `k` operations, where each operation consists of incrementing any element of the array by 1.**
