Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers from the new input split by a space, `c` is the sum of the non-negative elements of `l` that are contiguous, `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and the current `c`**

Explanation:
- The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a new input line and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to `n` and `k`.
- The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` were already integers from a previous input split by a space, but this code overwrites those values with new integers from the new input.
- The values of `i`, `l`, `c`, and `maxi` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `int(input())` is greater than 1 is still valid, as it was not affected by the code snippet.
- The new values of `n` and `k` are the integers from the new input split by a space.
