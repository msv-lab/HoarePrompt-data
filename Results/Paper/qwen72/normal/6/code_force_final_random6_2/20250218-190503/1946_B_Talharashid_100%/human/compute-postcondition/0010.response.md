Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers from the input split by a space that must have at least 1 element, `c` is `ele`, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`, and either `ele` is greater than or equal to 0, or `c` is greater than `abs(ele)`**

Explanation: The value of `c` is updated to `ele` (the first element in the list `l`). All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
