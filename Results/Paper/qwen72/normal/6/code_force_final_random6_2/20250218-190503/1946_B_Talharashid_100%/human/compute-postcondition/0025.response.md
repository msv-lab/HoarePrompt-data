Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers from the input split by a space, `c` is the cumulative sum of the positive elements in `l` up to the last element processed, and `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` encountered during the loop execution.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The initial condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 remains true.
- The variable `i` remains 0.
- The variables `n` and `k` retain their values from the input.
- The list `l` remains unchanged.
- The variable `c` is the cumulative sum of the positive elements in `l` up to the last element processed, but it is reset to 0 whenever a negative element in `l` is encountered and the cumulative sum `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of that negative element.
- The variable `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` that was encountered during the loop execution, which means it holds the highest cumulative sum of positive elements before any reset due to a negative element.
