### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, the function should take parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`.
   - The function uses `input()` to read the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. This part is correct in terms of handling multiple test cases.

2. **Sum Calculation and Subarray Selection:**
   - The function initializes `c` and `maxi` to 0. `c` is used to keep track of the current sum of a contiguous subarray, and `maxi` is used to store the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray found so far.
   - The function iterates over the elements of the list `l` (which should be `a` as per the problem description).
   - If an element is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of the element, `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, and `c` is reset to 0.
   - If an element is non-negative, `c` is incremented by the element, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - After the loop, `maxi` is updated one last time to ensure the maximum sum of the contiguous subarray is captured.
   - The final result is calculated as `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.
   - This formula is intended to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum to the array.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where the array contains negative numbers by resetting `c` when a large negative number is encountered.
   - The function also handles the case where the array contains only non-negative numbers by continuously adding to `c` and updating `maxi`.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers, which is correct as per the problem description.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function does not handle the case where the array is entirely negative correctly. In such cases, the maximum sum should be 0 (since an empty subarray can be selected), but the function might not return the correct result.
   - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array has a mix of positive and negative numbers, especially when the sum of the entire array is negative.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem. Specifically, it does not handle arrays with only negative numbers or mixed positive and negative numbers correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Correctness: **False**
