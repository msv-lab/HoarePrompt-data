Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is not a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`.** 

Explanation:
- The variable `p` is assigned the length of the string `l`, which is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- If `k` is not a power of 2, `l` is a string representing the binary form of `k`, and `p` is the number of characters in that string.
