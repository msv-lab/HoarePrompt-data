You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

If `k` is a power of 2, the value of `k` was printed. If `k` is not a power of 2 and `n` is 0, the value 1 or 2 was printed depending on whether `m` is odd or even, respectively. Otherwise, the value `k - 2



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for determining the length of the longest common subsegment is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
1
0 1
```

According to the problem description, the sequences generated are:
- \(a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, \ldots]\)
- \(b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, \ldots]\)

The longest common subsegment here is of length 1, as the sequences do not share any longer common subsegments. The program should output `1` for this case.

However, the program's logic is:
```python
k = abs(n - m)
if k & k - 1 == 0:
    print(k)
elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
    print(1)
elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
    print(2)
else:
    l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
    p = len(l)
    q = 2 ** (p - 1)
    print(k - q)
```

For the input \(n = 0\) and \(m = 1\):
- \(k = abs(0 - 1) = 1\)
- \(k & k - 1 = 1 & 0 = 0\), which is true, so the program prints `1`.

This is correct for the given input. However, consider another input:
```
1
12 4
```

According to the problem description, the sequences generated are:
- \(a = [13, 10, 11, 8, 9, 6, 7, 2, \ldots]\)
- \(b = [5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 6, 7, 14, \ldots]\)

The longest common subsegment here is of length 8, starting from \(a_6 = b_5 = 6\) and ending at \(a_{13} = b_{12} = 14\). The program should output `8` for this case.

However, the program's logic for this input is:
- \(k = abs(12 - 4) = 8\)
- \(k & k - 1 = 8 & 7 = 0\), which is true, so the program prints `8`.

This is correct for the given input. However, consider another input:
```
1
57 37
```

According to the problem description, the sequences generated are:
- \(a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, 41, 40, 43, 42, 45, \ldots]\)
- \(b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, 41, 40, 43, 42, 53, 52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]\)

The longest common subsegment here is of length 4, starting from \(a_{16} = b_{12} = 41\) and ending at \(a_{19} = b_{15} = 42\). The program should output `4` for this case.

However, the program's logic for this input is:
- \(k = abs(57 - 37) = 20\)
- \(k & k - 1 = 20 & 19 = 4\), which is not zero, so the program goes to the else block.
- \(l = bin(20).replace('0b', '') = '10100'\)
- \(p = len('10100') = 5\)
- \(q = 2 ** (5 - 1) = 16\)
- The program prints \(20 - 16 = 4\).

This is correct for the given input. However, consider another input:
```
1
316560849 14570961
```

According to the problem description, the sequences generated are:
- \(a = [316560849, 316560848, 316560850, 316560851, \ldots]\)
- \(b = [14570961, 14570960, 14570962, 14570963, \ldots]\)

The longest common subsegment here is of length 33554432. The program should output `33554432` for this case.

However, the program's logic for this input is:
- \(k = abs(316560849 - 14570961) = 301989888\)
- \(k & k - 1 = 301989888 & 301989887 = 0\), which is true, so the program prints `301989888`.

This is incorrect. The program should output `33554432` for this case, but it outputs `301989888`.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and the correctness is **False**.
