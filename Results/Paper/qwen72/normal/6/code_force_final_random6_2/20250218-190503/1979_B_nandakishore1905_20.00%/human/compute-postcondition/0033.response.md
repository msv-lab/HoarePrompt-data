Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k`, and `q` is 2 raised to the power of (p - 1).**

Explanation:
- `n` and `m` are now assigned the values of the input integers provided by the user, which are greater than 0.
- The values of `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The value of `k` is now the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- If `k` is a power of 2, no additional changes are made to the variables.
- Otherwise, `l` is set to the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of this binary representation, and `q` is 2 raised to the power of (p - 1).
