Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `m` to the input integers provided.
- The values of `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The value of `k` is recalculated as the absolute difference between the new values of `n` and `m`.
- No additional changes are made to `l`, `p`, or `q` at this stage, as the conditions for their calculation have not been evaluated yet.
