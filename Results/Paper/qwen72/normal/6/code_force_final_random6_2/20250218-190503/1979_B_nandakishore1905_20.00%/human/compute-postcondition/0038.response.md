Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is not a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')` converts `k` to its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- If `k` is a power of 2, no additional changes are made, so `l` is not updated.
- If `k` is not a power of 2, `l` is updated to the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
