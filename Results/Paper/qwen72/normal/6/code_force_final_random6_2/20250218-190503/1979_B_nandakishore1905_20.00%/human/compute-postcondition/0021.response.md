Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

The value of `k` is updated to the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The other variables `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `x` and `y` being distinct non-negative integers within the specified range, and `n` and `m` being input integers greater than 0, are still valid.
