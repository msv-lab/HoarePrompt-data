Functionality: ** The function reads a number of test cases from the user, and for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. It then calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`. If `k` is not a power of 2 and `n` is 0, it prints 1 if `m` is odd, and 2 if `m` is even. Otherwise, it prints the value `k - 2^(p-1)`, where `p` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. **
