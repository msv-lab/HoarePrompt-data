You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x ≠ y.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = abs(n - m)
        
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `int(input())` times, and for each iteration `i` from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`, the following conditions were checked: `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, the value of `k` was printed. If `k` is not a power of 2 and `n` is 0, the value 1 or 2 was printed depending on whether `m` is odd or even, respectively. Otherwise, the value `k - 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a number of test cases from the user, and for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. It then calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`. If `k` is not a power of 2 and `n` is 0, it prints 1 if `m` is odd, and 2 if `m` is even. Otherwise, it prints the value `k - 2^(p-1)`, where `p` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given two distinct non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \).
   - We need to find the length of the longest common subsegment in the sequences \( a_n = n \oplus x \) and \( b_n = n \oplus y \).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The sequences \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) are generated by applying the XOR operation with \( x \) and \( y \) respectively.
   - The XOR operation is a bitwise operation that flips bits where the corresponding bits of the two operands are different.
   - The difference between \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) is \( (n \oplus x) \oplus (n \oplus y) = x \oplus y \). This means the sequences \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) will differ by \( x \oplus y \) for all \( n \).

3. **Finding the Longest Common Subsegment:**
   - For \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) to have a common subsegment, the difference \( x \oplus y \) must be a power of 2. This is because the XOR of two consecutive numbers \( n \) and \( n+1 \) will flip the least significant bit, and this pattern will repeat every power of 2.
   - If \( x \oplus y \) is a power of 2, the length of the longest common subsegment is \( x \oplus y \).
   - If \( x \oplus y \) is not a power of 2, we need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than \( x \oplus y \).

4. **Special Cases:**
   - If \( x = 0 \) and \( y \) is odd, the longest common subsegment is of length 1.
   - If \( x = 0 \) and \( y \) is even, the longest common subsegment is of length 2.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It calculates \( k = |x - y| \).
   - It checks if \( k \) is a power of 2 using the condition \( k \& (k - 1) == 0 \). This is a common bit manipulation trick to check if a number is a power of 2.
   - If \( k \) is a power of 2, it prints \( k \).
   - If \( x = 0 \) and \( y \) is odd, it prints 1.
   - If \( x = 0 \) and \( y \) is even, it prints 2.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the largest power of 2 less than \( k \) and prints \( k - \text{this power of 2} \).

6. **Verification:**
   - The logic for checking if \( k \) is a power of 2 is correct.
   - The special cases for \( x = 0 \) and \( y \) being odd or even are correctly handled.
   - The calculation of the largest power of 2 less than \( k \) and the subsequent subtraction to find the length of the longest common subsegment is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the length of the longest common subsegment based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
