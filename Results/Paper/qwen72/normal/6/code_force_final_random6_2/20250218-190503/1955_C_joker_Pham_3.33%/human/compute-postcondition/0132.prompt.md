Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1, `sunks` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n` - 1 or `n` - 2, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `a[r] < a[l]`, then `sunks` remains 0 or is set to 1 depending on the conditions checked before entering this if statement, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `l` is updated to 1 if `a[l]` becomes 0 after the subtraction, otherwise `l` remains 0, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]` which is now less than or equal to `a[r]`, `k` is set to 0, and `sunks` is set to 1. If `k` is less than `a[r] * 2` and `a[r] * 2 - 1` is equal to `k`, then `sunks` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0 or is set to 1 depending on the conditions checked before entering this if statement, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, and `r` is `n` - 1, `n` - 2, or `n` - 3, with `a[l]` less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `a[r] < a[l]`, and `k` >= `2 * a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, and `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k` < `2 * a[r]` and `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k` and `k` > 0 and `l` != `r`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `l` == `r`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, `sunks` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `l` == `r` or if `k` < `2 * a[l]` or `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, or 2, `r` is `n` - 2, `n` - 3, or `n` - 4. If `a[r]` < `a[l]`, and `k` >= `a[r] * 2`, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1. If `a[r]` < `a[l]` and `k` < `a[r] * 2` but `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r]` < `a[l]` and `k` < `a[r] * 2` but `a[r] * 2 - 1 != k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement without changing `sunks`. If `a[r]` >= `a[l]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement without changing `sunks`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
