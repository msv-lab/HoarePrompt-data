Output State: **`sunks` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n` - 2 or `n` - 3, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `a[l]` == 0, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, and `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]` and `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
