Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n` - 2 or `n` - 3, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `l` == `r`, the value of `sunks` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `k` is now `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`, and `sunks` is now `sunks + 1`.**
