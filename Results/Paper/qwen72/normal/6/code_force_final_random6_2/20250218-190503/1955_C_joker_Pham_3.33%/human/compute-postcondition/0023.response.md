The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 1, `r` is `n` - 1, `sunks` is 1, `k` is now `k` - `a[0] * 2`, and `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[0]`. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is updated to `n` - 2 and `sunks` is set to 1.**
