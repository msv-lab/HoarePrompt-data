Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 1 or 2, `r` is `n` - 1, `n` - 2, or `n` - 3, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, `sunks` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so `l` is now either 1 or 2, depending on whether it was 0 or 1 initially.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged, but the specific updates to `k` and `a[l]` are still valid.
- The precondition that `r` is `n` - 1, `n` - 2, or `n` - 3 remains valid.
- The precondition that `sunks` is increased by 1 remains valid.
