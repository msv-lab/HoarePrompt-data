Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n` - 1, `n` - 2, or `n` - 3, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[l]` is updated by subtracting `a[r]` from it.
- The value of `k` is already decreased by `a[r] * 2` as per the initial state.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
