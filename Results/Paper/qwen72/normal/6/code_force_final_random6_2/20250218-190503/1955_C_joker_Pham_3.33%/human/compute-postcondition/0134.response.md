The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraints 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The function returns the final count of operations performed, stored in the variable `sunks`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers within specified ranges, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. It returns the final count of operations performed, stored in the variable `sunks`.**
