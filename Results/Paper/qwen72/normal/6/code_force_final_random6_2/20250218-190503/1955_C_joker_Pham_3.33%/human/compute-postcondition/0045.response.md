Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n` - 2 or `n` - 3, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]` after the subtraction, `k` is 0, `sunks` is 1, and the first element of `a` (at index `l`) is `a[l] - a[r]` which is now less than or equal to the last element of `a` (at index `r`). If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is 1 and `sunks` is 1; otherwise, `l` is 0 and `sunks` is 1.**
