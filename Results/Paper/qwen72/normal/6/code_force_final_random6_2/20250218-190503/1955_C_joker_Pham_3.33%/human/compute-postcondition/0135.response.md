Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers within specified ranges, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. It performs a series of operations that involve decrementing `k` and adjusting the values in the list `a` based on the values at the left and right pointers (`l` and `r`). The function returns the total count of operations performed, stored in the variable `sunks`. After the function concludes, `k` is reduced by a certain amount, elements in `a` may be modified, and `sunks` contains the number of operations that were successfully completed. **
