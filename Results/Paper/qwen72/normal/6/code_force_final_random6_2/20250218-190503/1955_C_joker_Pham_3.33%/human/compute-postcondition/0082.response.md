Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n` - 1 or `n` - 2, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sunks` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` are not directly changed by the code snippet, but the precondition states that `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]` and `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`.
- Therefore, the updated values of `k` and `a[l]` are included in the output state, along with the incremented value of `sunks`.
