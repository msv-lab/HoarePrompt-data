Output State: **`t` is 0, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, for each test case. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `n`. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is `n // 2 * 3`. If `n // 2 * 3` is less than 200, the length of `s` remains less than 200. If `n // 2 * 3` is greater than or equal to 200, the length of `s` remains greater than or equal to 200.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the value of `t` will be 0. For each iteration, the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `n`, and `s` remains undefined. If `n` is even, `s` is a string that consists of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is `n // 2 * 3`. If this length is less than 200, the string `s` is printed as 'YES' followed by the string itself. If the length is 200 or more, 'NO' is printed, and `s` is not defined for that iteration. The state of `n` and `s` for each iteration is independent of the others.
