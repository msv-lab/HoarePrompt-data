Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly solves the problem based on the provided problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.

2. **Special Character Condition**: The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because special characters must come in pairs (e.g., 'AA', 'BB').

3. **String Construction**: If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. This ensures that each 'A' in the pattern 'AAB' is a special character (since it is equal to its neighbor 'A'), and the total number of special characters is `n`.

4. **Length Check**: The program checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than or equal to 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If the length exceeds 200, it prints 'NO'. However, since `n` is at most 50, the length of `s` will never exceed 200 (the maximum length of `s` is `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`), so this check is always true.

5. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case as specified in the problem description.

Given the constraints and the logic, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
