### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters.
   - A special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The string should have a length of at most 200.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a single integer `n`.
   - For each test case, we need to determine if a valid string can be generated.
   - If a valid string can be generated, we print "YES" followed by the string.
   - If no valid string can be generated, we print "NO".

3. **Special Character Analysis:**
   - For a character to be special, it must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - This means that in a valid string, every special character must be part of a pair of identical characters, but not part of a triplet or more.

4. **String Construction:**
   - The program constructs the string using the pattern "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times.
   - This pattern ensures that each "A" is special because it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors (the other "A" in the pair).
   - The "B" in the pattern is not special because it is not equal to either of its neighbors.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n` is odd, it is impossible to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters because each special character must be part of a pair.
   - If `n` is even, the string can be constructed using the pattern "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times.
   - The length of the string should be at most 200. The program checks this by ensuring `len(s) < 200`.

6. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
   - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO".
   - If `n` is even, it constructs the string `s` using the pattern "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times.
   - It then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints "YES" followed by the string `s`. If not, it prints "NO".

7. **Validation:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by printing "NO".
   - The program correctly constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters when `n` is even.
   - The program ensures that the length of the string is at most 200, which is a requirement of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided constraints.

Correctness: **True**
