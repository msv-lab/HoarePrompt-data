The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the values of `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of `t` and `n`.

Output: **NO**
