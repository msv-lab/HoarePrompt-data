Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, and is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t` or `n`. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is less than 200 if `n // 2 * 3` is less than 200, otherwise the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200.**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to the integer input provided.
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, and is greater than 0. This remains unchanged.
- The initial state also specifies conditions for `n` and `s` if `n` is even. Since the code only assigns a new value to `n`, these conditions remain as they were initially stated.
