The function `func` is described with a context that it should be called with a single integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 50`. For each test case, a single integer `n` is provided, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 50`. However, the function signature provided does not include these parameters. Assuming the function is intended to process these test cases, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function is designed to process a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function returns the results for each test case, but the specific output for each `n` is not provided in the given information.**
