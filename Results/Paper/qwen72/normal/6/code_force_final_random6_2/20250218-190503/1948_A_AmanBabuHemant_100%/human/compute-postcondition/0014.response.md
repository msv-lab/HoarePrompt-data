The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, and is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, so `t` will now be an integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, and must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, and is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t` or `n`. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is less than 200 if `n // 2 * 3` is less than 200, otherwise the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200.**
