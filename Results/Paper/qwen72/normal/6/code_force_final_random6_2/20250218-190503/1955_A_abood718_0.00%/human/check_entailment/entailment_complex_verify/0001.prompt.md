You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, `i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `A` is an integer input, `B` is an integer input, `C` is an integer input. If `B * 2 < C`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it accepts three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 30. If `B * 2 < C`, it prints `A * B`. If `A` is even, it prints `A * C / 2`. If `A` is odd, it prints two values: `A // 2` and `A // 2 * C + B`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Logic for Each Test Case:**
   - **Case 1: `B * 2 < C`**
     - If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is less than the promotion price (`C`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price.
     - The program prints `A * B`, which is the total cost of buying `A` yogurts at the regular price.
     - This part of the logic is correct.

   - **Case 2: `A % 2 == 0`**
     - If the number of yogurts `A` is even, then Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.
     - The program prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the total cost of buying `A` yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.
     - This part of the logic is correct.

   - **Case 3: `A % 2 != 0`**
     - If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, then Maxim can buy `A // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price.
     - The program prints `X` (which is `A // 2`), and then prints `X * C + B`.
     - However, there is a mistake here. The program should not print `X` separately. It should only print the total cost `X * C + B`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic for the first two cases is correct.
   - The logic for the third case is almost correct, but the program incorrectly prints `X` before the final result.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issue, we need to remove the extra print statement for `X` in the third case. The corrected program should look like this:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning and the corrected program, the original program is incorrect due to the extra print statement in the third case.

Correctness: **False**
