Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).
- `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `A` is an integer input.
- `B` is an integer input.
- `C` is an integer input.
- If `B * 2` is less than `C`, no additional changes are made.
- If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and `A` is even, no additional changes are made.
- If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int(A * C / 2))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Values:**
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user.
   - `A` and `C` are used in the `print` statement.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `B * 2` is less than `C`, no additional changes are made to `A` or `C`.
   - If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`:
     - If `A` is even, no additional changes are made.
     - If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`. However, `X` is not used in the `print` statement.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement calculates `int(A * C / 2)` and prints the result.
   - The value of `A` and `C` remains unchanged regardless of the conditions involving `B`.

### Calculation:
- The expression `int(A * C / 2)` computes the integer division of the product of `A` and `C` by 2.
- The result will be the floor of the division, meaning any fractional part will be discarded.

### Final Output:
- The output will be the integer result of the expression `int(A * C / 2)`.

Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A and C are the integer inputs provided by the user)**
