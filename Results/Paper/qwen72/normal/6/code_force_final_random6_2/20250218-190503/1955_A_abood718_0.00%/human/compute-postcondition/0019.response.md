Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).
- `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `A` is an integer input.
- `B` is an integer input.
- `C` is an integer input.
- `X` is set to `A // 2` if `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd; otherwise, `X` remains undefined.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(X * C + B)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Values:**
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integer inputs.
   - `A` is an integer.
   - `B` is an integer.
   - `C` is an integer.

2. **Condition for `X`:**
   - `X` is defined only if `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd.
   - If `B * 2 < C` or `A` is even, `X` remains undefined.

3. **Expression in `print` Statement:**
   - The expression `X * C + B` will be evaluated.
   - If `X` is undefined, the expression will raise a `NameError` because `X` is not defined.

### Conclusion:
- If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd, `X` will be set to `A // 2`.
- The `print` statement will then output `X * C + B`.
- If `B * 2 < C` or `A` is even, `X` will remain undefined, and the `print` statement will raise a `NameError`.

### Final Output:
- If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd:
  - `X` will be `A // 2`.
  - The output will be `X * C + B`, which is \((A // 2) * C + B\).
- If `B * 2 < C` or `A` is even:
  - `X` will remain undefined.
  - The output will be a `NameError`.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (if B * 2 >= C and A is odd); otherwise, NameError**
