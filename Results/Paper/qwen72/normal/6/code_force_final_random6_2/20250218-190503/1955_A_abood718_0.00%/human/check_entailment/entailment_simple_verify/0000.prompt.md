You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, `i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `A` is an integer input, `B` is an integer input, `C` is an integer input. If `B * 2 < C`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the handling of the case when the number of yogurts `A` is odd. Specifically, the program prints the value of `X` (which is `A // 2`) before calculating the final cost, which is incorrect. Additionally, the final cost calculation for the odd case is incorrect. The correct approach should be to calculate the cost for the even part of `A` using the promotion price and then add the cost of the remaining single yogurt at the regular price.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            X = A // 2
            if A % 2 == 0:
                print(X * C)
            else:
                print(X * C + B)
```

In the given program, for the input:
```
4
2 5 9
3 5 9
3 5 11
4 5 11
```
The program will produce the following output:
```
9
14
1
15
```
The output for the third test case is incorrect. The correct output should be `15` (2 yogurts at 11 burles and 1 yogurt at 5 burles), but the program prints `1` due to the incorrect print statement.
