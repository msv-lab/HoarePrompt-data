Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `A` is an integer input.
   - `B` is an integer input.
   - `C` is an integer input.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(A * B)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will output the product of `A` and `B`.
   - `A` and `B` are both integer inputs provided by the user.
   - The values of `A` and `B` are not explicitly given in the initial state, but they are integers.
   - The condition `int(input()) > 2` is mentioned, but it does not directly affect the values of `A` or `B` in the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the product of the two integer inputs `A` and `B`.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integer inputs provided by the user)**
