The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted. The state of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
