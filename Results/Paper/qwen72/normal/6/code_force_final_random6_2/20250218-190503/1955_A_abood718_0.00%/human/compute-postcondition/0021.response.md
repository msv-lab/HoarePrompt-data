Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `A` is an integer input, `B` is an integer input, and `C` is an integer input. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, no additional changes are made. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and `A` is even, no additional changes are made. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**
