Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `A` is an integer input.
   - `B` is an integer input.
   - `C` is an integer input.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(int(A * C / 2))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The code snippet only involves the variables `A` and `C`.
   - `A` and `C` are both integers provided as inputs.
   - The expression `A * C / 2` calculates the product of `A` and `C`, then divides it by 2.
   - The `int()` function is used to convert the result of the division to an integer. This means any fractional part will be truncated (i.e., the result is rounded down to the nearest integer).

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The exact values of `A` and `C` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot compute a specific numerical result.
   - However, we can describe the output in terms of `A` and `C`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the integer result of the expression `A * C / 2`.

Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A and C are the integer inputs provided)**
