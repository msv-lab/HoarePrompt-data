Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `A` is an integer and is an odd integer.
   - `B` is an integer.
   - `C` is an integer, and \(B \times 2 \geq C\).
   - `X` is equal to \(A // 2\).

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `A` is an odd integer. When an odd integer is divided by 2 using integer division (`//`), the result is the largest integer less than or equal to half of `A`. For example, if `A` is 5, then `X` is 2.
   - `B` is an integer.
   - `C` is an integer, and it is given that \(B \times 2 \geq C\). This means `C` is at most twice the value of `B`.

3. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   - The expression in the `print` statement is `X * C + B`.
   - `X` is \(A // 2\), which is the largest integer less than or equal to half of `A`.
   - `C` is an integer such that \(B \times 2 \geq C\).
   - `B` is an integer.

4. **Calculating the Output:**
   - Since `A` is an odd integer, `X` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{A}{2} \right\rfloor\), where \(\left\lfloor \cdot \right\rfloor\) denotes the floor function.
   - The value of `X * C + B` depends on the specific values of `A`, `B`, and `C`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `X * C + B`.
   - Given the constraints, `X` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{A}{2} \right\rfloor\), `C` is an integer such that \(B \times 2 \geq C\), and `B` is an integer.

Output: **X * C + B (where X is \(\left\lfloor \frac{A}{2} \right\rfloor\), A is an odd integer, B is an integer, and C is an integer such that \(B \times 2 \geq C\))**
