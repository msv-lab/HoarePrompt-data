Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the handling of the case when the number of yogurts `A` is odd. Specifically, the program prints the value of `X` (which is `A // 2`) before calculating the final cost, which is incorrect. Additionally, the final cost calculation for the odd case is incorrect. The correct approach should be to calculate the cost for the even part of `A` using the promotion price and then add the cost of the remaining single yogurt at the regular price.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            X = A // 2
            if A % 2 == 0:
                print(X * C)
            else:
                print(X * C + B)
```

In the given program, for the input:
```
4
2 5 9
3 5 9
3 5 11
4 5 11
```
The program will produce the following output:
```
9
14
1
15
```
The output for the third test case is incorrect. The correct output should be `15` (2 yogurts at 11 burles and 1 yogurt at 5 burles), but the program prints `1` due to the incorrect print statement.
