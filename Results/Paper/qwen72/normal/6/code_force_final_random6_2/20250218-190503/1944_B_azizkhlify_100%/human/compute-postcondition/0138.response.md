Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `ul` is either unchanged or increased by 2 based on the condition that the element at the index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 2.
- If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Print Statement:
```
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**:
   - The variable `i` is explicitly given as 1.

2. **List `a`**:
   - The list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we know that `a[i]` is being accessed where `i` is 1.
   - Therefore, `a[1]` is the element at index 1 of the list `a`.

3. **Output of the Print Statement**:
   - The print statement will print the value of `a[1]` twice, followed by a space (because `end=' '` is specified).

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is 1, the print statement will print the value at index 1 of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the value at index 1 of the list a)**
