To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `res`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is the index where `re` equals `k` or `n` if `re` never equals `k`
- `ul` is either unchanged or increased by 2 for each `j` in the range `0` to `n-1` where `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2, and `l[a[j] - 1]` is set to 0 for each `j` in the range `0` to `n-1` where `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2. If `ul` reaches `k * 2` at any point, the loop breaks, and `i` will be the index at which this condition was met.
- `k` is now `2 * k - ul`
- If the initial `k` was non-zero, `res` is a list that includes all elements `a[j]` for which `l[a[j] - 1]` was 1, up to the point where `re` equals `k` or the loop completes.
- If the initial `k` was zero, the program fragment does not execute, and the variables remain unchanged.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in res:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, `res` must be a non-empty list. The variable `i` will take on the values of the elements in `res` during each iteration of the loop.

### Adjusted State:
- `res` must be a non-empty list for the loop to execute.
- `i` will be the first element of `res` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`res` is a non-empty list, `i` is the first element of `res`**
