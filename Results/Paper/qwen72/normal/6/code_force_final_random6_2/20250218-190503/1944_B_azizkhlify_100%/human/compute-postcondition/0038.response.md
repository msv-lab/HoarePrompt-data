Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code snippet).
- `k` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `l` is a list of length `n` with the element at index `a[i] - 1` set to 0 if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged.
- `r` is a list of length `n` with the element at index `a[j] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.
- `re` is 0.
- `ul` is 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, otherwise `ul` remains 0.
- `ur` is 0.
- `res` is an empty list.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the value of `i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is 2.
2. **Access the value of `a[i]`**: Since `i` is 2, we need to access the third element of the list `a` (because list indices are 0-based).
3. **Print the value of `a[i]` twice**: The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Output:
The value of `a[i]` is the third element of the list `a`. Since the exact values of the elements in `a` are not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the list `a`.

Output: **a[2] a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list `a`)**
