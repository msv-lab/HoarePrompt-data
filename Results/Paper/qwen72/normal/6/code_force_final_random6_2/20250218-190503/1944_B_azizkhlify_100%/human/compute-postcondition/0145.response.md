Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `total` is unchanged.
- `students_list` is unchanged.
- `ul` is unchanged.
- `a[0]` is unchanged.
- `l` is unchanged.
- `k` is unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is printing the value of `a[i]` twice.
- The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

### Determining the Value of `a[i]`:
- The initial state tells us that `i` is 2.
- Therefore, `a[i]` is `a[2]`.

### Output:
Since the exact value of `a[2]` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe it in terms of its position in the list `a`.

Output: **a[2] a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list `a`)**
