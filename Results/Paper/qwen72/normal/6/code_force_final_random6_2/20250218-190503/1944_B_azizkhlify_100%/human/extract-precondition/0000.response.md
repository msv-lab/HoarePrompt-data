Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. Additionally, it should take a list `a` of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function should return two lists `l` and `r`, each of length 2k, where `l` is a subset of the first half of `a` and `r` is a subset of the second half of `a`, and the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`.**
