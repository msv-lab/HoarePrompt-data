Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `total` is unchanged, `students_list` is unchanged, `a[0]` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged. If `ul` was equal to `k * 2`, and if `l[a[2] - 1]` was 2, then `ul` is increased by 2 and `l[a[2] - 1]` is set to 0. Otherwise, all variables retain their initial values, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
