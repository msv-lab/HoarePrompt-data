Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `res` is a non-empty list.
   - `ul` and `ur` are not equal.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - The value of `r[a[n] - 1]` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is set to `n`.
   - The code snippet prints the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

4. **Determine the Value of `a[i]`:**
   - According to the initial state, `i` is equal to `n`.
   - The value of `r[a[n] - 1]` is 2. This implies that `a[n]` is an index in the list `r` that, when decremented by 1, results in an index that has the value 2 in `r`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `i` is `n`, the value `a[i]` is the same as `a[n]`.
   - The value of `a[n]` is not explicitly given, but we know that `r[a[n] - 1]` is 2. This means `a[n]` must be an index in `r` that, when decremented by 1, points to the value 2 in `r`.

6. **Output:**
   - The code will print `a[n]` twice, followed by a space.

Since the exact value of `a[n]` is not provided, we can only describe it based on the given condition. The value of `a[n]` is the index in `r` such that `r[a[n] - 1]` is 2.

Output: **a[n] a[n] (where a[n] is the index in r such that r[a[n] - 1] is 2)**
