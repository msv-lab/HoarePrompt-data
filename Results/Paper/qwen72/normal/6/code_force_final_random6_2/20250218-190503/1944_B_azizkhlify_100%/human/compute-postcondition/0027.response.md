Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `_` is a placeholder, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of length `n` with the element at index `a[j] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `r` is a list of length `n` with the element at index `a[j] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, otherwise `ul` remains 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, and the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 0 if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2. Additionally, `ul` is equal to `k * 2`.**
