The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `n` to `2 * n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1` and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to `n + 2`, and `n` must still be such that `i` is less than `2 * n`.

State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**
