Postcondition: ***`res` is a non-empty list, `ul` and `ur` are not equal, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is `n + 1`. If `ul == ur`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ur` is updated to `ur + 2`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is not 2, the values of `res`, `ul`, `ur`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
