Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `res` is a list containing elements from `a` based on certain conditions.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `r` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` (from the first `n` elements) that were equal to 2 in `l` and were reset to 0.
   - `ur` is 0 or 2.
   - `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`.
   - If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is set to `n + 1`.
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, `i` will be at least 1 greater than the length of the lists `l` and `r`.
   - The lists `l` and `r` are both of length `n`, so `i` is out of bounds for these lists.
   - However, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and its length is not explicitly defined. If `a` has at least `n + 1` elements, then `a[i]` will be the element at index `n + 1` in the list `a`.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will print the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.
   - Since `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is greater than 0, `a[i]` will be the element at index `n + 1` of the list `a`.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:
Output: **a[n + 1] a[n + 1] (where a[n + 1] is the element at index n + 1 in the list a)**
