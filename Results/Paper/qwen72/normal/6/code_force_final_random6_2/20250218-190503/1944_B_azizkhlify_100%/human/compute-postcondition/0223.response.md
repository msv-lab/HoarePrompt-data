The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is an empty list, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `re` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[0] - 1` incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, and the conditions for updating `ur` and `r` are still pending based on the values in `a` and `r`.**
