To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `res` is a list containing elements from `a` based on certain conditions.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `r` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `i` is `n + 2`.
   - `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` (from the first `n` elements) that were equal to 2 in `l` and were reset to 0.
   - `ur` is 0 or 2.
   - `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`.
   - If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is: `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - `i` is defined as `n + 2`.
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, `i` will be at least 2 (if `n` is 1) and will be greater than the length of `l` and `r`, which are both lists of `n` integers.
   - The `print` statement will print the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.

4. **Determining the Value of `a[i]`:**
   - The value of `a[i]` depends on the input list `a` and the value of `n`.
   - Since `i` is `n + 2`, it will be an index that is beyond the first `n` elements of `a`.
   - Without knowing the exact values of `a` and `n`, we can only describe `a[i]` in terms of the input list `a`.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.
   - Since `i` is `n + 2`, the element at index `i` is the element at position `n + 2` in the list `a`.

Output: **a[n + 2] a[n + 2] (where a[n + 2] is the element at index n + 2 in the list a)**
