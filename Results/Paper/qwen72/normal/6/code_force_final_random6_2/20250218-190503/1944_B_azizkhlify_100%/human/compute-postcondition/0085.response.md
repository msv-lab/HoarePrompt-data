Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, `ur` is increased by 2.** 

The value of `ur` is incremented by 2, but the values of `n`, `i`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` is still greater than 0, `i` is still equal to `n`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is still 0.
