Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is set to `n`.
   - The code snippet prints `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

4. **Determine the Value of `a[i]`:**
   - According to the initial state, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.
   - This implies that `a[i] - 1` must be an index in the list `r` that corresponds to the value 2.
   - Therefore, `a[i]` must be the index in `r` that, when decremented by 1, gives 2. Hence, `a[i]` must be 3.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `a[i]` is 3, the print statement will output `3` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **3 3**
