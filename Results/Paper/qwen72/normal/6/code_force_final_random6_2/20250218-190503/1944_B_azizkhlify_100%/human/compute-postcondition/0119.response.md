The code snippet `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. Therefore, the index being incremented is `a[2] - 1`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l[a[0] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `l[a[1] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `l[a[2] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**
