The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('PEAK')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state describes several variables and conditions:
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
  - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by user input.
  - `n` must be greater than 1.
  - `i` is 1.
  - If `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` is true.
  - If `a < b` and `b > c`, then the condition `a < b and b > c` is true.
  - Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b and b > c` is true.

- The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
  ```
  print('PEAK')
  ```

- This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'PEAK'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'PEAK'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, or `i`.

Output: **PEAK**
