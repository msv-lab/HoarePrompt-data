The code snippet provided contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'STAIR'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `n`) and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always be the same.

Output: **STAIR**
