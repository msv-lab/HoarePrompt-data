You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input. It then checks the relationship between these integers and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b` and `b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value but affects the program state by reading input and printing output based on the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.

2. **Conditions for Stair and Peak:**
   - The program checks if the digits form a stair by using the condition `a < b < c`.
   - It checks if the digits form a peak by using the condition `a < b and b > c`.

3. **Output:**
   - If the condition `a < b < c` is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - If the condition `a < b and b > c` is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither condition is true, it prints "NONE".

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), which should correctly output "NONE".
   - The program also handles cases where the digits are in different orders, such as `3 4 1` (which should output "PEAK").

5. **Correctness:**
   - The conditions used in the program correctly match the problem description.
   - The program reads the input and processes each test case as required.
   - The output for each test case is correctly formatted and matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
