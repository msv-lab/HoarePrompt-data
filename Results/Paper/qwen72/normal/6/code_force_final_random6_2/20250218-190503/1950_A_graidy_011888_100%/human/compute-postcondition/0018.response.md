Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` is true. If `a < b` and `b > c`, the condition `a < b and b > c` is true. Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b and b > c` is true.***
