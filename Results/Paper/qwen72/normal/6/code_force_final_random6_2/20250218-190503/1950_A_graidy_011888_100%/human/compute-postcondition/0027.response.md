The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function operates under the context where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but it is expected to process these inputs in some way.

Since the output is not clearly defined, we can infer that the function might return a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each of the `t` test cases. However, without more specific details about the output, we cannot accurately describe the return value.
