Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases, `n`, and for each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. The program then checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`). If either condition is met, it prints the corresponding output. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE". The program handles all the specified input constraints and outputs the correct results for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
