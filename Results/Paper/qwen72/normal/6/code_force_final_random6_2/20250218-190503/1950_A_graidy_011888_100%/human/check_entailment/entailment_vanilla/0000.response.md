### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `n` times, processing each test case one by one. This is also correct as per the problem description.

3. **Reading Test Case Input**: Inside the loop, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. The `map(int, input().split())` function correctly converts the input string into three integers, which is appropriate for the problem.

4. **Condition for Stair**: The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correctly implemented and matches the problem description.

5. **Condition for Peak**: The program checks if `a < b` and `b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correctly implemented and matches the problem description.

6. **Default Case**: If neither the stair nor the peak conditions are met, the program prints "NONE". This is the correct default case as per the problem description.

7. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
