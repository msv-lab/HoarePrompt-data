### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying the primary issue with the program: it only performs the operation once, which is insufficient for handling cases where multiple operations are required to sort the array. Let's break down the program and the function summary to understand why this is a problem.

1. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.
   - It then iterates through the array and checks if the current element is less than the previous element and if the previous element is greater than or equal to 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if the array is sorted.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

2. **Function Summary:**
   - `func_1(lst)` returns `True` if the list `lst` is sorted in ascending order and `False` otherwise.
   - It does not modify the input list `lst`.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - **Single Operation Limitation:** The program only performs the operation once for each pair of elements where the previous element is greater than the current element and is at least 10. This is a significant limitation because the problem requires the ability to perform the operation multiple times to achieve a sorted array.
   - **Counterexample:** Consider the test case `[12, 28, 5]`. The program will only split `12` into `[1, 2]` if it is the first element that violates the non-decreasing order. However, it does not consider the possibility of splitting `28` into `[2, 8]` and then splitting `12` into `[1, 2]` to achieve the sorted array `[1, 2, 2, 5, 8]`. This is a clear case where the program fails to produce the correct output.
   - **Correctness of `func_1`:** The function `func_1` correctly checks if the list is sorted in ascending order. However, the main issue lies in the main program logic, which does not ensure that the array can be sorted by performing the required operations multiple times.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly and fails to consider the possibility of performing multiple operations to sort the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final:
Final: **False**
