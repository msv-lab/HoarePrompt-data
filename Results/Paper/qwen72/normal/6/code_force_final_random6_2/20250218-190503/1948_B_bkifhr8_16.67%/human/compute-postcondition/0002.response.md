The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive. After executing the function body, if the list `lst` is already sorted in ascending order, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `lst` where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order. If the list is not sorted in ascending order, it returns `False`.**
