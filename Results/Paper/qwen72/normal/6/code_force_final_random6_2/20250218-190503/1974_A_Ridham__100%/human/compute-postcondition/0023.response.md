Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 0, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing `[screen_require_for_y]`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15` is 0, or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.***
