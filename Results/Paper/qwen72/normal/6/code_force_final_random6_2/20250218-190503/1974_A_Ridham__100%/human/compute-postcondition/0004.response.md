Output State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`.** 

The variable `space_x` is assigned the value of `x` multiplied by 1, which means `space_x` is now equal to `x`. The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `result` remain unchanged.
