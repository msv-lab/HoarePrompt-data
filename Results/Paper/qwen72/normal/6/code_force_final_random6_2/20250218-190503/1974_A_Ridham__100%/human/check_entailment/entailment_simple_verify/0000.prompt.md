You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, x and y, where x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))

            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    #State: `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is an input integer, `result` is a list containing the number of screens required for each iteration of the loop, where the number of screens required for each iteration is calculated as follows: If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`, and if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`. The remaining cells on the screen are calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`. If `space_x` (which is `x`) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the number of screens required for that iteration is `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, the number of screens required is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: 5
    #8
    #10



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 2x2 icons is such that they do not completely fill the screens, and the remaining space is not efficiently used for 1x1 icons. Specifically, the program assumes that each 2x2 icon will occupy a full screen if there are an odd number of 2x2 icons, which is not always the most efficient way to place the icons.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
13 1
```
The program will output:
```
3
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
2
```
This is because one 2x2 icon can be placed on the first screen, leaving 11 cells free. The 13 1x1 icons can then be placed on the first and second screens, with 2 cells left over on the second screen. Thus, only 2 screens are needed, not 3.
