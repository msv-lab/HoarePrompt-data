Output State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`. If `x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing `[screen_require_for_y]`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is equal to `x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15` is 0, or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `space_y = y * 4` updates the value of `space_y` to be `y * 4`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The initial state already defined `space_y` as `y * 4`, so this assignment does not change the value of `space_y`.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
