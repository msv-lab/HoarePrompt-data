Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 2x2 icons is such that they do not completely fill the screens, and the remaining space is not efficiently used for 1x1 icons. Specifically, the program assumes that each 2x2 icon will occupy a full screen if there are an odd number of 2x2 icons, which is not always the most efficient way to place the icons.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
13 1
```
The program will output:
```
3
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
2
```
This is because one 2x2 icon can be placed on the first screen, leaving 11 cells free. The 13 1x1 icons can then be placed on the first and second screens, with 2 cells left over on the second screen. Thus, only 2 screens are needed, not 3.
