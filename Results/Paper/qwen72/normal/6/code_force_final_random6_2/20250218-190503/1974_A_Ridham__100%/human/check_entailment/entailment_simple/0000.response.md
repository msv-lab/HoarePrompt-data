### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The total space required for 1x1 icons is `space_x = x * 1`.
   - The total space required for 2x2 icons is `space_y = y * 4`.
   - The total space required is `total_space = space_y + space_x`.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - If the number of 2x2 icons `y` is even, the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is `screen_require_for_y = y // 2`.
   - If `y` is odd, the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The remaining cells on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons are calculated as `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

5. **Screen Calculation for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the space required for 1x1 icons `space_x` is less than or equal to the remaining cells, the number of screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
   - If `space_x` exceeds the remaining cells, the extra space required is `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`.
   - The number of extra screens required is calculated as `extra_screen = extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.
   - The total number of screens required is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.

6. **Output**:
   - The function appends the total number of screens required for each test case to the `result` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Even and Odd Handling for 2x2 Icons**:
  - The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is correct. If `y` is even, each 2x2 icon can be placed on a separate screen. If `y` is odd, one additional screen is needed to accommodate the last 2x2 icon.

- **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
  - The calculation of remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons is correct. Each screen has 15 cells, and the number of cells used by 2x2 icons is `y * 4`.

- **Handling 1x1 Icons**:
  - The logic for placing 1x1 icons in the remaining cells is correct. If the space required for 1x1 icons is less than or equal to the remaining cells, no additional screens are needed. If more space is required, the extra screens are calculated correctly.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1: (1, 1)**
  - `y = 1` (odd), so `screen_require_for_y = 1`.
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 4 = 11`.
  - `space_x = 1` which is less than `remaining_cells`, so the total number of screens required is `1`.

- **Test Case 2: (7, 2)**
  - `y = 2` (even), so `screen_require_for_y = 1`.
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 8 = 7`.
  - `space_x = 7` which is equal to `remaining_cells`, so the total number of screens required is `1`.

- **Test Case 3: (12, 4)**
  - `y = 4` (even), so `screen_require_for_y = 2`.
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 2 - 16 = 14`.
  - `space_x = 12` which is less than `remaining_cells`, so the total number of screens required is `2`.

- **Test Case 4: (0, 3)**
  - `y = 3` (odd), so `screen_require_for_y = 2`.
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 2 - 12 = 18`.
  - `space_x = 0`, so the total number of screens required is `2`.

- **Test Case 5: (1, 0)**
  - `y = 0`, so `screen_require_for_y = 0`.
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 0 - 0 = 0`.
  - `space_x = 1` which is more than `remaining_cells`, so `extra_screen = 1`.
  - The total number of screens required is `1`.

- **Test Case 6: (8, 1)**
  - `y = 1` (odd), so `screen_require_for_y = 1`.
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 4 = 11`.
  - `space_x = 8` which is less than `remaining_cells`, so the total number of screens required is `1`.

- **Test Case 7: (0, 0)**
  - `y = 0`, so `screen_require_for_y = 0`.
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 0 - 0 = 0`.
  - `space_x = 0`, so the total number of screens required is `0`.

- **Test Case 8: (2, 0)**
  - `y = 0`, so `screen_require_for_y = 0`.
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 0 - 0 = 0`.
  - `space_x = 2` which is more than `remaining_cells`, so `extra_screen = 1`.
  - The total number of screens required is `1`.

- **Test Case 9: (15, 0)**
  - `y = 0`, so `screen_require_for_y = 0`.
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 0 - 0 = 0`.
  - `space_x = 15` which is more than `remaining_cells`, so `extra_screen = 1`.
  - The total number of screens required is `1`.

- **Test Case 10: (8, 2)**
  - `y = 2` (even), so `screen_require_for_y = 1`.
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 8 = 7`.
  - `space_x = 8` which is more than `remaining_cells`, so `extra_space = 8 - 7 = 1`.
  - `extra_screen = 1 // 15 + 1 = 1`.
  - The total number of screens required is `1 + 1 = 2`.

- **Test Case 11: (0, 9)**
  - `y = 9` (odd), so `screen_require_for_y = 5`.
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 5 - 36 = 39`.
  - `space_x = 0`, so the total number of screens required is `5`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens. The logic and calculations are sound, and the program produces the correct output for all given test cases.
