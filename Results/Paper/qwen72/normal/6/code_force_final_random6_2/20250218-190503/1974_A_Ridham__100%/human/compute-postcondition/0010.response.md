Output State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `y` is an odd number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`.**

The value of `screen_require_for_y` is calculated as `y // 2 + 1`. Since `y` is an odd number, `y // 2` will be the integer division of `y` by 2, and adding 1 to this result gives the value of `screen_require_for_y`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
