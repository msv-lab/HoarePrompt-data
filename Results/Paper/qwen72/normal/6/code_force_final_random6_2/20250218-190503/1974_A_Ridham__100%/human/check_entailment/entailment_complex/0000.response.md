### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times, reading the values of `x` and `y` for each test case. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the total space required for `x` and `y` applications correctly. `space_x` is `x * 1` and `space_y` is `y * 4`.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The function calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons (`screen_require_for_y`). If `y` is even, it uses `y // 2` screens, and if `y` is odd, it uses `y // 2 + 1` screens. This is correct because each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and a screen has 15 cells, so the maximum number of 2x2 icons per screen is 3 (since 3 * 4 = 12 cells, leaving 3 cells free).

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the remaining cells on the screens used for 2x2 icons as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. This is correct because each screen has 15 cells, and the total number of cells used by 2x2 icons is `space_y`.

5. **Fitting 1x1 Icons**:
   - The function checks if the 1x1 icons (`space_x`) can fit into the remaining cells. If they can, it appends `screen_require_for_y` to the result list. If they cannot, it calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons and appends the total number of screens (`extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`) to the result list.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results for each test case, one per line, which matches the problem description.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Case for Zero Icons**: The function correctly handles the case where both `x` and `y` are zero, as it will append 0 to the result list and print it.
- **Correctness of Screen Calculation**: The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons and the remaining cells is correct. The logic for calculating the additional screens required for 1x1 icons is also correct, as it accounts for the possibility of needing an extra screen if the remaining space is not enough.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the specified requirements and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
