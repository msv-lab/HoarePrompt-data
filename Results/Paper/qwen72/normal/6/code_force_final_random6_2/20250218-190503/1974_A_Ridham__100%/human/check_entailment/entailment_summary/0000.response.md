### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times, reading the values of `x` and `y` for each test case. This matches the problem description.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the total space required for `x` (1x1 icons) and `y` (2x2 icons) correctly.
   - `space_x` is `x * 1` (since each 1x1 icon takes 1 cell).
   - `space_y` is `y * 4` (since each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells).

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The function calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. Since each screen can hold 7.5 2x2 icons (15 cells / 4 cells per icon), the function uses:
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` if `y` is even.
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.
   - This is correct because each screen can hold up to 7 2x2 icons, and if `y` is odd, one more screen is needed to accommodate the extra 2x2 icon.

4. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` is correct because each screen has 15 cells, and the total space used by `y` icons is `space_y`.

5. **Fitting 1x1 Icons**:
   - The function checks if the remaining space is enough to fit all the 1x1 icons.
   - If `space_x <= remaining_cells`, it means all 1x1 icons fit on the screens already allocated for 2x2 icons.
   - If `space_x > remaining_cells`, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells` calculates the space still needed for 1x1 icons.
     - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + (1 if extra_space % 15 != 0 else 0)` is a correct way to calculate the additional screens needed. However, the function uses a slightly different but equivalent approach:
       - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`.
       - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0`.

6. **Output**:
   - The function appends the total number of screens required to the `result` list and prints the results for all test cases at the end.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens. The logic for calculating the number of screens required is sound and matches the problem description. The function also correctly prints the results for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
