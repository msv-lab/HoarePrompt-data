Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem by calculating the minimum number of screens required to fit all the application icons, given the constraints and the sizes of the icons. The program takes into account the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons and determines how many screens are needed to fit all the icons, ensuring that the 2x2 icons are placed first to minimize the number of screens used. The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons is sound and matches the requirements of the problem statement. The program also handles the cases where additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. The output format is correct, and the program will produce the expected results for the given test cases.
