The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Instead, it reads an integer `n` from the user input, indicating the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` (where 0 <= x, y <= 99) from the user input. The function calculates the number of screens required based on the values of `x` and `y`. Specifically, it determines the number of screens needed for `y` (even or odd) and checks if `x` can fit into the remaining cells on those screens. If `x` fits, the number of screens required is the same as for `y`. If `x` does not fit, additional screens are calculated based on the remaining space needed for `x`. The function then prints the number of screens required for each iteration, one per line.
