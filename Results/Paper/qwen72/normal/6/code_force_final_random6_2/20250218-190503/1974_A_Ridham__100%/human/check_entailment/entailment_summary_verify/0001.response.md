### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).
   - It also calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`).
   - The total space required is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`, but this is not directly used in the final calculation.

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program determines the number of screens required to fit all the 2x2 icons. Since each screen can fit 2 of the 2x2 icons (each screen has 15 cells, and 2x2 icons take 4 cells each), the calculation is:
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` if `y` is even.
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.
   - This is correct because each screen can fit exactly 2 of the 2x2 icons, and if there is an odd number of 2x2 icons, one additional screen is needed.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the remaining cells on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - This is correct because each screen has 15 cells, and the total number of cells used by the 2x2 icons is `space_y`.

5. **Fitting 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program checks if the remaining cells are sufficient to fit all the 1x1 icons: `if space_x <= remaining_cells`.
   - If they are, it appends the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons to the result list.
   - If they are not, it calculates the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells` calculates the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed.
     - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + (extra_space % 15 > 0)` calculates the number of additional screens needed. This is correct because each screen can fit 15 1x1 icons, and if there are any remaining icons that don't fit into a full screen, one additional screen is needed.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case on a separate line, which matches the problem's output requirements.

### Additional Considerations:
- The program assumes that the 2x2 icons are placed first, which is a valid strategy because each 2x2 icon takes up more space than a 1x1 icon.
- The program correctly handles the edge case where `x` and `y` are both zero, outputting `0` screens as required.
- The program also handles the case where there are no 2x2 icons (`y = 0`) and only 1x1 icons, correctly calculating the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, calculates the number of screens required for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons, and outputs the results in the expected format. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: True**
