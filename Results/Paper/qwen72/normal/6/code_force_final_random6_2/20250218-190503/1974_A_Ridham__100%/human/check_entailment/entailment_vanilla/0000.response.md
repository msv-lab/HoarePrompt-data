### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y` for each case.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`).
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).
   - The total space required for all icons is then `total_space = space_y + space_x`.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program determines the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using:
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` if `y` is even.
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.
   - This is correct because each screen can hold up to 3 (15/4) 2x2 icons, and if `y` is odd, one additional screen is needed to accommodate the last 2x2 icon.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the remaining cells on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - This is correct because each screen has 15 cells, and the total number of cells used by the 2x2 icons is `space_y`.

5. **Space Calculation for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program checks if the remaining cells are sufficient to place all the 1x1 icons (`if space_x <= remaining_cells`).
   - If they are, the program appends the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons to the result.
   - If they are not, the program calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells` calculates the number of cells still needed.
     - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + (1 if extra_space % 15 != 0 else 0)` calculates the number of additional screens required. This is correct because if `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, it will be exactly the number of screens needed, and if not, one additional screen is required to accommodate the remaining cells.

6. **Output**:
   - The program appends the total number of screens required to the `result` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens. It correctly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons and then determines if the remaining cells are sufficient for the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

**Correctness: True**
