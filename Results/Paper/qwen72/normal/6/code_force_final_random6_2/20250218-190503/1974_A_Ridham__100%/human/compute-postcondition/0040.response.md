The loop head in this case is simply `_` and `n`. The only variable that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes one more time is `n`. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not hold any specific state that needs to be adjusted.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `_` is not a variable that holds state relevant to the loop's execution, it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 0, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list that includes `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is equal to `x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)`, `extra_screen` is equal to `(x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)) // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `(x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)) // 15 + 1` otherwise, and `result` is a list containing the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.**
