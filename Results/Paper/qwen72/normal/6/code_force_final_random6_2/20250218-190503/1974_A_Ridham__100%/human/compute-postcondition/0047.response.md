Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are updated to the new values provided by the user input, `n` is greater than 0, `space_x` is equal to the new `x`, `space_y` is equal to the new `y * 4`, and `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4`. In both cases, if `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list that includes `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is equal to `x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise, and `result` is a list containing the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.**
