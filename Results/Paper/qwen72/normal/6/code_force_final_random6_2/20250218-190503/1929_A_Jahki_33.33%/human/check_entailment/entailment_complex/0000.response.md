### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` is in strictly increasing order.
   - If the array is already in strictly increasing order, the function returns `True`.
   - If the array is not in strictly increasing order, the function returns `False`.

3. **Beauty Calculation:**
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the program prints `0` because the beauty of an array in strictly increasing order is `0` (since \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\) will be positive and the sum of these differences will be the difference between the last and first elements, which is not maximized by rearranging).
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the program sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Function `func_1` Misuse:**
  - The function `func_1` is checking if the array is in strictly increasing order, but this is not necessary for the problem. The goal is to maximize the beauty, which is achieved by sorting the array.
  - The function `func_1` should not be used at all because it does not contribute to the solution. The beauty is maximized by sorting the array, regardless of its initial order.

### Corrected Program:
```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    b = sorted(a)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect because it uses an unnecessary function `func_1` that does not help in maximizing the beauty of the array.
- The corrected program directly sorts the array and calculates the beauty, which is the correct approach.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
