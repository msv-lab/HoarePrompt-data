To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user.
2. `t` is greater than 2.
3. `i` is 2.
4. `count` is `m + 1`.
5. `ans` is equal to `n + Σ(g / count + 1)` for each iteration where `g` is `n / count - (count - 1)`.
6. `countmins` is `m - 1`.
7. `g` is the final value of `n / m - (m - 1)`.
8. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `n` and `m` are provided by the user.
   - `count` is initialized to `m + 1`.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Loop:**
   - The loop iterates while `i` is less than `t` (which is greater than 2).
   - In each iteration:
     - `g` is calculated as `n / count - (count - 1)`.
     - `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1`.
     - `count` is incremented by 1.
     - If `g` is less than `countmins` (which is `m - 1`), the loop breaks.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - After the loop, `ans` is the sum of `n` and the values added in each iteration.
   - The `print(int(ans))` statement will print the integer part of `ans`.

### Detailed Calculation:
- **Initial Values:**
  - `n` and `m` are user-provided.
  - `count = m + 1`.
  - `ans = n`.
  - `countmins = m - 1`.

- **Loop Iteration:**
  - For each iteration `i` (starting from 2 and less than `t`):
    - Calculate `g` as `n / count - (count - 1)`.
    - Update `ans` by adding `g / count + 1`.
    - Increment `count` by 1.
    - If `g < countmins`, break the loop.

- **Final Value of `ans`:**
  - `ans` is the sum of `n` and the values added in each iteration of the loop.
  - The exact value of `ans` depends on the values of `n`, `m`, and `t`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume some values for `n`, `m`, and `t` to illustrate the process:
- Suppose `n = 10`, `m = 3`, and `t = 5`.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `count = 3 + 1 = 4`.
   - `ans = 10`.
   - `countmins = 3 - 1 = 2`.

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - **Iteration 1 (i = 2):**
     - `g = 10 / 4 - (4 - 1) = 2.5 - 3 = -0.5`.
     - `ans = 10 + (-0.5 / 4 + 1) = 10 + (-0.125 + 1) = 10 + 0.875 = 10.875`.
     - `count = 4 + 1 = 5`.
     - Since `g = -0.5` is less than `countmins = 2`, the loop breaks.

3. **Final Value of `ans`:**
   - `ans = 10.875`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(int(ans))` will print the integer part of `10.875`, which is `10`.

### General Output:
Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `t` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables and the loop conditions.

Output: **int(ans) (where ans is the final value of n + Σ(g / count + 1) for each iteration, and g is n / count - (count - 1))**
