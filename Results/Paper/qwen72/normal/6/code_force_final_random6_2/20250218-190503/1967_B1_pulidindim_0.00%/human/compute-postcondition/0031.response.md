To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(ans))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the formula used to compute `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though it is not used in the given code snippet).
- `i` is 0 (though it is not used in the given code snippet).
- `count` is \(m + 1\) (though it is not used in the given code snippet).
- `ans` is equal to \(n + \sum_{k=2}^{m+1} \left( \frac{n}{k} - \frac{(k - 1)}{k} + 1 \right)\).
- `countmins` is \(m\).
- `g` is equal to \(\frac{n}{m} - (m - 1)\). If `g` < `countmins`, the loop breaks.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `ans`**:
   - `ans` is computed as \(n + \sum_{k=2}^{m+1} \left( \frac{n}{k} - \frac{(k - 1)}{k} + 1 \right)\).
   - Let's break down the sum:
     - For each \(k\) from 2 to \(m+1\), the term inside the sum is \(\frac{n}{k} - \frac{(k - 1)}{k} + 1\).
     - Simplifying the term:
       \[
       \frac{n}{k} - \frac{(k - 1)}{k} + 1 = \frac{n - (k - 1) + k}{k} = \frac{n - k + 1 + k}{k} = \frac{n + 1}{k}
       \]
     - Therefore, the sum can be rewritten as:
       \[
       \sum_{k=2}^{m+1} \frac{n + 1}{k}
       \]
   - The final value of `ans` is:
     \[
     ans = n + \sum_{k=2}^{m+1} \frac{n + 1}{k}
     \]

2. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - `g` is \(\frac{n}{m} - (m - 1)\).
   - `countmins` is \(m\).
   - The loop breaks if \(\frac{n}{m} - (m - 1) < m\).
   - Simplifying the condition:
     \[
     \frac{n}{m} - (m - 1) < m \implies \frac{n}{m} < 2m - 1 \implies n < m(2m - 1)
     \]
   - Given \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), this condition is likely to be true for most values of `n` and `m` within the given range, so the loop will break.

3. **Final Value of `ans`**:
   - Since the loop breaks, the sum is computed as described.
   - The sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{m+1} \frac{n + 1}{k}\) is a harmonic series modified by the factor \(n + 1\).
   - The exact value of this sum depends on the values of `n` and `m`, but it can be approximated for large values of `m` using the harmonic series properties.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The final value of `ans` is \(n + \sum_{k=2}^{m+1} \frac{n + 1}{k}\).
   - The `print(int(ans))` statement will print the integer part of `ans`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the given formula and the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the integer part of the calculated `ans`.

Output: **int(ans) (where ans is \(n + \sum_{k=2}^{m+1} \frac{n + 1}{k}\))**
