Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of unique integers (each integer is increased by its index + 1) sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`. If `i` > 0, `counter` is updated to decrease the count of `a[i - 1]` by `adv`, `cnt` is updated to `n - len(a) - adv` and must be greater than 0, `adv` is the minimum value among `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - 1` through `a[i - 1] - adv` in descending order, and `j` is `adv - 1`. Otherwise, `i` remains 0, `counter` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains `n - len(a)`, and `ans` remains an empty list.***
