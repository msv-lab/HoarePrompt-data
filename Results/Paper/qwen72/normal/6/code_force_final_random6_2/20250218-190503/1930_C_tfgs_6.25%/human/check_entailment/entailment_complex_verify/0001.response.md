### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Transformation of Array `a`**:
   - The program transforms each element of the array `a` by adding the index `i + 1` to it. This step is correct as it follows the problem description of inserting `a_i + i` into the set `S`.

3. **Counting and Removing Duplicates**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the transformed array `a`.
   - It then converts the transformed array `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order. This step is necessary to ensure that the elements in the set `S` are unique and sorted in decreasing order.

4. **Constructing the Array `b`**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the elements of the array `b`.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique elements of `a` and appends them to `ans`.
   - To ensure the lexicographically largest array `b`, it also appends additional elements that are just below the current element in the sorted list, but only if they are not already in the set `S`. This is done by calculating the number of such elements (`adv`) and appending them to `ans`.
   - The logic for appending additional elements (`adv`) is complex but necessary to ensure the lexicographically largest array `b`.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements**:
   - After processing all unique elements, if there are still elements left to be added (`cnt`), it appends the next smallest elements to `ans` until `cnt` is zero.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case, which represents the lexicographically largest array `b`.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Transformation of Array `a`**:
  - The transformation `a[i] += i + 1` is correct and aligns with the problem description.

- **Counting and Removing Duplicates**:
  - Using `Counter(a)` to count occurrences and `set(a)` to remove duplicates is appropriate.
  - Sorting the set in descending order (`a.sort(reverse=True)`) ensures that the largest elements are considered first.

- **Constructing the Array `b`**:
  - The loop `for i in range(len(a))` correctly iterates through the sorted unique elements.
  - The calculation of `adv` (`min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])`) ensures that the maximum number of elements just below `a[i - 1]` are added without exceeding the remaining count `cnt` or the count of `a[i - 1]` in the original array.
  - The inner loop `for j in range(adv)` appends these elements to `ans`.
  - The element `a[i]` is appended to `ans` and its count in `counter` is decremented.

- **Handling Remaining Elements**:
  - The final loop `for _ in range(cnt)` appends the next smallest elements to `ans` until `cnt` is zero, ensuring that the total length of `ans` is `n`.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where the same element might be inserted multiple times into the set `S` correctly by using a set and a `Counter`.
  - The logic for appending additional elements (`adv`) is complex but necessary to ensure the lexicographically largest array `b`.

- **Performance**:
  - The program is efficient for the given constraints, as the use of `Counter` and `set` operations are generally fast for the input sizes specified.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the steps required to solve the problem and construct the lexicographically largest array `b` based on the given problem description. The original assessment was accurate in its reasoning and conclusion.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
