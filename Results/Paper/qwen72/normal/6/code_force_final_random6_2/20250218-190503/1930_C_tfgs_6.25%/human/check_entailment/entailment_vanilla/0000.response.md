### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Transformation of Array `a`**:
   - The program transforms each element of the array `a` by adding the index `i + 1` to it. This step is correct as it follows the problem description of inserting `a_i + i` into the set `S`.

3. **Counting and Removing Duplicates**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the transformed array `a`.
   - It then converts the transformed array `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order. This step is necessary to ensure that the elements in the set `S` are unique and sorted in decreasing order.

4. **Constructing the Array `b`**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the elements of the array `b`.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique elements of `a` and appends them to `ans`.
   - To ensure the lexicographically largest array `b`, it also appends additional elements that are just below the current element in the sorted list, but only if they are not already in the set `S`. This is done by calculating the number of such elements (`adv`) and appending them to `ans`.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements**:
   - After processing all unique elements, if there are still elements left to be added (`cnt`), it appends the next smallest elements to `ans` until `cnt` is zero.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case, which represents the lexicographically largest array `b`.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The transformation step ensures that each element `a_i` is correctly modified to `a_i + i`.
- The use of a `Counter` and a set to remove duplicates and sort the elements is appropriate.
- The construction of `b` ensures that the largest possible elements are added first, and any necessary smaller elements are added to maintain the lexicographical order.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not explicitly handle the case where the same element might be inserted multiple times into the set `S`. However, the use of a set and the `Counter` ensures that duplicates are managed correctly.
- The logic for appending additional elements (`adv`) is complex but necessary to ensure the lexicographically largest array `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the steps required to solve the problem and construct the lexicographically largest array `b` based on the given problem description.
