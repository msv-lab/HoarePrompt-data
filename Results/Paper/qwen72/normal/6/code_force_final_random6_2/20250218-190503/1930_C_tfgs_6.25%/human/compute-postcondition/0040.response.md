Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`), `j` is `adv - 1`, and the count of `a[0]` in `counter` is decreased by 1. If `i` > 0, `a` has at least 2 elements, `n` is greater than `len(a)`, `counter[a[0]]` is greater than 0, and `cnt` is now `cnt - adv`, where `adv` is the minimum of `a[0] - a[1] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[0]]`. Additionally, `ans` has been appended with the values `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - adv`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` is now `counter[a[i - 1]] - adv`.***
