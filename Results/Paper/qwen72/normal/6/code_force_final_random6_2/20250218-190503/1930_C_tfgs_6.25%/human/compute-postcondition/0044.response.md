Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) and the second element of `a` (i.e., `a[1]`), `j` is `adv - 1`, the count of `a[0]` in `counter` is decreased by 1, the count of `a[1]` in `counter` is now `counter[a[1]] - 1, and `adv` is the minimum value among `a[1] - a[2] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[1]]`.**
