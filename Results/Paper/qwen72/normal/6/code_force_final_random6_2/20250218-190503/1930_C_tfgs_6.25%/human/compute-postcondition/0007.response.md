Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `i` is 2, `a[0]` is increased by 1, `a[1]` is increased by 2, `a[2]` is increased by 3.**
