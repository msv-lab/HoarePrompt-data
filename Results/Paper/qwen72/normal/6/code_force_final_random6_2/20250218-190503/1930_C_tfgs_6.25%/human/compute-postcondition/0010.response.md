Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of unique integers (each integer is increased by its index + 1), `i` is `n-1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(set(a))` converts the list `a` into a set, which removes any duplicate elements, and then back into a list.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The list `a` now contains only unique elements, each of which has been increased by its index + 1.
- The `counter` object will still count the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, but since `a` now contains only unique elements, each integer will have a count of 1.
