Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the insertion and deletion operations as described in the problem. Specifically, the program modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element, but it does not follow the exact steps of selecting an index, inserting the element into the set, and then deleting the element from the array. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

The expected output should be:
```
4 3 2
```

However, the program will output:
```
4 3 2
```

But the issue is in the logic of how the elements are handled. The program does not correctly simulate the process of selecting an index, inserting the element into the set, and then deleting it from the array. Instead, it directly modifies the array and then sorts the unique elements, which may not always produce the correct lexicographically largest array `b`.

A correct implementation should follow the steps exactly as described, ensuring that the set `S` is updated correctly and the array `a` is modified by removing the selected element after each operation.
