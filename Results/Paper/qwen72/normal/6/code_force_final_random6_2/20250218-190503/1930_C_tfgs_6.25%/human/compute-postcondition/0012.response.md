Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of unique integers (each integer is increased by its index + 1) sorted in descending order, `i` is `n-1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`**.

In natural language: The initial state remains the same, but a new variable `cnt` is introduced. `cnt` is calculated as the difference between `n` and the length of the list `a`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
