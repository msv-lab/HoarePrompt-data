Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
- `_` is 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- `i` is 2.
- `first` is `False`.

The code snippet to analyze is:
```python
print(i)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`**:
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2 in the initial state.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if i is not in mpp.keys()` is mentioned. This condition checks if the integer 2 is not a key in the `Counter` object `mpp`.
   - If 2 is not in `mpp.keys()`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - However, the code snippet provided is simply `print(i)`, which is executed regardless of the condition check.

3. **Execution of `print(i)`**:
   - Since `i` is explicitly set to 2, the `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 2.

### Final Output:
Output: **2**
