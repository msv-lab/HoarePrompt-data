Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `_` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 2, and `first` remains True or False based on the previous iteration's conditions. If `i` is in the keys of `mpp` and `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, the program continues. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
