Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mpp = Counter(arr)
    first = False
    for i in range(n):
        if i not in mpp.keys():
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1:
            first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `_` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, and `first` is True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once and is less than `n-1`. If `n-1` is not in `mpp` or `mpp[n-1]` is 1 and `first` is True, the loop will break. Otherwise, the loop completes all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `_` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, and `first` is True if any integer from 0 to `n-1` appears exactly once in `arr` and was encountered after the first such integer, otherwise `first` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `_` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, and `first` is True if there is at least one integer `x` in `arr` such that `mpp[x] == 1` and `x` is the first integer in the range `[0, n-1]` that meets this condition. Otherwise, `first` remains False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
