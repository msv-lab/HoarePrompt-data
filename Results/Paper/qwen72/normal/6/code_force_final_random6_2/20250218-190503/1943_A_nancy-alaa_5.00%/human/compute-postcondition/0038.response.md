Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `_` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, and `first` is True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once and is less than `n-1`. If `n-1` is not in `mpp` or `mpp[n-1]` is 1 and `first` is True, the loop will break. Otherwise, the loop completes all iterations.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`.
- The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, and `first` are not directly affected by this code snippet.
- The new value of `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- The conditions and constraints on `t`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, and `first` remain unchanged.
- The state of `mpp` will be updated based on the new values in `arr`, but since the code snippet does not explicitly update `mpp`, it remains a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- The loop conditions and the value of `first` remain as described in the initial state.
