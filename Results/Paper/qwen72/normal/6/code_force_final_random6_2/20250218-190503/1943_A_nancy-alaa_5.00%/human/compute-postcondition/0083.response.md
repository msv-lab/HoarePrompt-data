Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `first` is True.
   - `i` is in `mpp.keys()`.
   - `mpp[i]` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 0 in the initial state.
   - The condition `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is 1 confirms that the integer 0 is present in the list `arr` and it appears exactly once.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 0.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **0**
