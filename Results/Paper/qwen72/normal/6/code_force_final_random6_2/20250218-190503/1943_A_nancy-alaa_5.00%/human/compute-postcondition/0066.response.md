Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
- `_` is 1.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- `i` is 2.
- `first` remains True or False based on the previous iteration's conditions.
- If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2 in the initial state.
- The `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`.

### Output:
Output: **2**
