Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here's why:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The program checks if `v[v[i]] == i` and prints `2` if true. This condition checks if friend `i` and their best friend `v[i]` are each other's best friends (i.e., they form a pair). However, this only works for the specific case where there is exactly one pair of friends who are each other's best friends. It fails to handle cases where there are multiple such pairs or where the friends form cycles of length greater than 2.

2. **General Case Handling**: The program prints `3` for all other cases, which is not always correct. For example, if the friends form a cycle of length 3 or more, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party can be less than 3.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to identify the smallest cycle in the friendship graph. If there is a cycle of length 2, you only need to invite 2 friends. If there is a cycle of length 3 or more, you need to invite at least 3 friends to ensure at least 2 friends attend. If there are no cycles, you need to invite at least 3 friends to ensure at least 2 friends attend.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_cycle_length(v, n):
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            current = i
            cycle_length = 0
            while not visited[current]:
                visited[current] = True
                current = v[current]
                cycle_length += 1
            if cycle_length == 2:
                return 2
    return 3

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(find_cycle_length(v, n))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function `find_cycle_length`**:
   - This function takes the list `v` and the number of friends `n`.
   - It uses a `visited` list to keep track of which friends have been visited.
   - It iterates through each friend and follows the chain of best friends until it detects a cycle.
   - If a cycle of length 2 is found, it returns 2.
   - If no cycle of length 2 is found, it returns 3.

2. **Main Program**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.
   - It calls the `find_cycle_length` function and prints the result.

This corrected program should handle all cases correctly.
