The function `func_1` is expected to be part of a larger solution that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list `p` of length `n` containing integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) where `p_i` is the best friend of the i-th friend. The function should calculate and return the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
