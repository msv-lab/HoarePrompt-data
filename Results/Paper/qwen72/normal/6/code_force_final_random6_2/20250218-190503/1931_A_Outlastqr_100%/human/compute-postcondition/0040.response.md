Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `t - 1`, and `n` is an input integer for the last iteration. If `n` > 52, `word` is the string formed by concatenating the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string with 'zz'. If `n` > 27 and `n` <= 52, `word` is the string 'a' followed by the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string followed by 'z'. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. If `n` < 27, `word` is 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3` in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `t - 1` because the loop starts with `i` at 0 and increments `i` by 1 after each iteration.
- For each iteration, `n` is an input integer provided by the user.
- The value of `word` is determined based on the value of `n`:
  - If `n` is greater than 52, `word` is the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string, followed by 'zz'.
  - If `n` is greater than 27 but less than or equal to 52, `word` is 'a' followed by the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string, followed by 'z'.
  - If `n` is exactly 27, `word` is 'aay'.
  - If `n` is less than 27, `word` is 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3` in the `alphabet` string.
- The `alphabet` string remains unchanged throughout the loop.
