Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. For example, when the input is 51, the correct lexicographically smallest word should be "azz", but the program outputs "ayz". This is because the program incorrectly handles the case where the sum of the positions is 51 by adding 'a' + alphabet[51 - 28] + 'z', which results in "ayz" instead of "azz".
