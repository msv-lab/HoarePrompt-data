The function `func` is described as taking an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word. However, the provided function signature does not include these parameters. Assuming the function signature should include these parameters, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 100) representing the number of test cases, and `n` (an integer between 3 and 78) representing the encoded word for each test case. The function returns the decoded word for each test case.**
