Precondition: **The function should take an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word.**

However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters, which is inconsistent with the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases and the encoded word. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func(t, encoded_words):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and encoded_words is a list of integers where each integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) represents the encoded word for each test case.**
