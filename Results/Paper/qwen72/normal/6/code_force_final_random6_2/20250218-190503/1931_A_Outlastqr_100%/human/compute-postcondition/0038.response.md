Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer. If `n` > 52, `word` is the string `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. If `n` > 27 and `n` <= 52, `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'. If `n` == 27, `word` is 'aay'. Otherwise, if `n` < 27, `word` is 'aa' followed by the character at the index `n - 3` in the `alphabet` string.***
