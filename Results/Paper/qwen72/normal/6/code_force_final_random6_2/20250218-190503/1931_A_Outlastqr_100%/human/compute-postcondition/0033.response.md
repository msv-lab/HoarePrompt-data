Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `word` is updated by concatenating the string 'a', the character at index `n - 28` of the `alphabet` list, and the string 'z'.
- The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `word` is a string that starts with 'a', followed by the character from the `alphabet` list at the position `n - 28`, and ends with 'z'.
