The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of items, with the constraint 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5.
- `m` is a positive integer, with the constraint 1 <= m <= 10^9.
- `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to buy, with the constraint 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9).
- `prices` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer represents the price of an item, and each price is within the range 1 <= prices[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n.

The function returns `total_cost`, which is the sum of the costs of all tickets bought.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. It returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, where the cost is calculated based on the given prices of `n` items.**
