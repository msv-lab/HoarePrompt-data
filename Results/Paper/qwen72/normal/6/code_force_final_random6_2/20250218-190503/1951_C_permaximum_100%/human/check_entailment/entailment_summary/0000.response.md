Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days with the constraint that no more than `m` tickets can be purchased on any given day, and the price of tickets increases by the number of tickets purchased on previous days. The program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always select the day with the lowest current ticket price to minimize the total cost.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of ticket prices `prices`.

2. **Heap Initialization**: It initializes a priority queue `pq` with tuples of the form `(price, day)` for each day, where `price` is the initial price of a ticket on that day, and `day` is the index of the day.

3. **Heap Operations**: The program uses a loop to repeatedly buy tickets from the day with the lowest current price. It pops the smallest price from the heap, adds the price increase due to previously purchased tickets, and calculates the cost of buying the maximum possible number of tickets (either `m` or the remaining tickets needed to reach `k`).

4. **Cost Calculation**: The total cost is updated by adding the cost of the tickets bought in the current iteration, and the number of tickets bought is also updated. The price increase is incremented by the number of tickets bought in the current iteration.

5. **Termination**: The loop continues until the total number of tickets bought reaches `k`.

6. **Output**: The program prints the total cost for each test case.

The program correctly handles the constraints and the logic required to minimize the total cost of purchasing `k` tickets. It ensures that the tickets are bought in the most cost-effective manner by always choosing the day with the lowest current price, and it accounts for the price increase due to the tickets purchased on previous days.

Given the execution summary, the program appears to work as intended and produces the correct output for the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
