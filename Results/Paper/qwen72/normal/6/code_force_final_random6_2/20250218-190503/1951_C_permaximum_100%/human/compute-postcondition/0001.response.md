The `heapq.heapify(pq)` function transforms the list `pq` into a heap, which is a specific tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a heap, the parent node is smaller than or equal to its children (for a min-heap). The transformation is done in-place, meaning `pq` is modified directly.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9).
- `prices` is a list of n integers where 1 <= prices[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n.
- `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from `prices` and its corresponding index.

After executing `heapq.heapify(pq)`:
- `pq` is now a heap, which means it is a list of tuples arranged such that the first element (the root) is the smallest tuple based on the price.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The values in `prices` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where 1 <= prices[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. `pq` is now a heap of tuples where each tuple contains a price from `prices` and its corresponding index, arranged such that the smallest price is at the root.**
