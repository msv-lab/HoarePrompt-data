Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be bought exceeds the maximum number of tickets that can be bought on a single day (`m`). The program increases the price for all subsequent days by the number of tickets bought on the current day, which can lead to incorrect results. 

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
3 2 5
1 2 3
```

Here, `n = 3`, `m = 2`, and `k = 5`. The prices per ticket are `[1, 2, 3]`.

The optimal way to buy 5 tickets is:
1. Buy 2 tickets on day 1 with a total cost of 2. The prices for the remaining days become `[3, 4]`.
2. Buy 2 tickets on day 2 with a total cost of 8. The prices for the remaining day become `[6]`.
3. Buy 1 ticket on day 3 with a total cost of 6.

The total cost should be `2 + 8 + 6 = 16`.

However, the provided program will output a different result because it does not correctly account for the price increase on subsequent days when the number of tickets to be bought exceeds `m`.

To fix this, the program should correctly update the prices of the remaining days after each purchase, and it should also ensure that the price increase is applied only to the days that have not yet been processed.
