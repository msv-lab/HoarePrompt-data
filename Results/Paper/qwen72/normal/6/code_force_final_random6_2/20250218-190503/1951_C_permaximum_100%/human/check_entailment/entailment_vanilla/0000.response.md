### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of prices `prices`.

2. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) `pq` with tuples of the form `(price, day)`, where `price` is the ticket price on a given day and `day` is the index of that day.
   - This ensures that the heap is sorted by the ticket prices, allowing us to always buy tickets from the cheapest available day.

3. **Heap Operations:**
   - The program uses a while loop to continue buying tickets until the total number of tickets bought equals `k`.
   - In each iteration, it pops the smallest price from the heap, which is the cheapest available day to buy tickets.
   - It then calculates the number of tickets to buy on that day, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets that can be bought on a single day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program correctly updates the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets bought on the current day, which is `price * tickets_to_buy`.
   - It also updates the number of tickets bought and the price increase for subsequent days.

5. **Price Increase:**
   - The price increase is correctly calculated by adding the number of tickets bought on the current day to `price_increase`.
   - This ensures that the prices for subsequent days are adjusted correctly.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total cost for each test case, which is the result of the function `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints. It uses a priority queue to always buy the cheapest available tickets and adjusts the prices for subsequent days accordingly. The program handles all the given constraints and test cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
