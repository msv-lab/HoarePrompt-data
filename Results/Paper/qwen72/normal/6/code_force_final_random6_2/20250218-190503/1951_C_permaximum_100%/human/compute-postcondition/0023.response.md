Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where 1 <= prices[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. `pq` is now a heap of tuples where the smallest tuple has been removed. `price` is the smallest price in the initial `pq` heap plus `2 * price_increase + price_increase`. `day` is the corresponding index of this smallest price in the `prices` list. `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy + price * tickets_to_buy + price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k) + min(m, k - tickets_bought) + tickets_to_buy`. `price_increase` is `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_to_buy` is now `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`. `tickets_bought` must be less than `k` for the loop to execute one more time.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy` updates the value of `total_cost` by adding `price * tickets_to_buy` to its current value.
- The previous value of `total_cost` was `price * tickets_to_buy + price * tickets_to_buy`, so after the update, `total_cost` becomes `price * tickets_to_buy + price * tickets_to_buy + price * tickets_to_buy`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `pq`, `price`, `day`, `tickets_bought`, `price_increase`, and `tickets_to_buy` remain unchanged except for `total_cost`.
- The condition for the loop to execute one more time (`tickets_bought` must be less than `k`) remains unchanged.
