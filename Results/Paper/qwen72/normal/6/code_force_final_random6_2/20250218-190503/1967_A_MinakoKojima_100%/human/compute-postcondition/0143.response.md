The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0. Given that `n` is already the first input integer greater than 0, we can ensure the loop executes by setting `n` to be at least 2. This means `n - 1` will be at least 1, allowing the loop to execute at least once. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first input integer greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `ans` is now equal to the first element of `a`, `res` is now equal to `n - 1`, `ans_list` is a list that contains the updated value of `ans` as its last element, and `i` is 0**
