Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans_list` is a list that contains the value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 2, `dif` is the difference between the third and second elements of the list `a`. If `k` is 0, `k`, `res`, and `ans` are not modified, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
