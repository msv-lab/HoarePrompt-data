Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans_list` is a list that contains the value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 2, `dif` is the difference between the third and second elements of the list `a`. If `i` is not 0, and `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 4 + k % 3` and `ans` is the first element of the list `a` plus `k // 3`. If `i` is not 0, and `dif` is not 0, `res` is `n - 2 + k % 3` and `ans` is the first element of the list `a` plus `k // 3`. If `i` is 0, the program does not modify `res` or `ans`. In all cases, `ans` is updated to `ans + k // 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
