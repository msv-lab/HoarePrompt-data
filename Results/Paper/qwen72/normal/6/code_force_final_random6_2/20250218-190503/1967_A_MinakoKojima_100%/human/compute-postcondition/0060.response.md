Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `dif` is the difference between the fourth and the third element of the list `a`. If `dif` is 0, `ans` remains equal to the first element of the list `a` and `res` is `n - 2`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k >= dif * (i + 1)` and `k >= dif * 2`, `ans` is equal to the first element of the list `a` plus `2 * dif` and `res` is `n - 5`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k >= dif * (i + 1)` but `k < dif * 2`, `ans` is equal to the first element of the list `a` plus `dif` and `res` is `n - 4`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k < dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is updated to `ans + k // 2` and `res` is `n - 3 + k % 2` if `k >= dif * 2` or `n - 2 + k % 2` otherwise. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is 0, `ans` is updated to `ans + k // 3` and `res` is updated to `res + k % 3`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
