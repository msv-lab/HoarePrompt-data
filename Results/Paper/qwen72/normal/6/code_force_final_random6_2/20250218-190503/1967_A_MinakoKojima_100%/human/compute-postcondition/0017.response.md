Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `i` is 0, and `dif` is the difference between the second and the first element of the list `a`. The current value of `dif` is not 0, and `res` remains equal to `n - 1`. Additionally, `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`.**
