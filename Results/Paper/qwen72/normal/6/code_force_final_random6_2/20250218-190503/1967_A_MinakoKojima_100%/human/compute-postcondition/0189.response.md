Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first input integer greater than 2, `k` is the second input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `ans` is now equal to the first element of `a` plus either the difference between the second and third elements of `a` (if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times 2) or `k` divided by 2 (if `k` is less than `dif` times 2), plus `k` divided by 3, `ans_list` is a list that contains the updated value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 2, `dif` is the difference between the third and fourth elements of `a`, `res` is increased by `k` modulo 3. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
