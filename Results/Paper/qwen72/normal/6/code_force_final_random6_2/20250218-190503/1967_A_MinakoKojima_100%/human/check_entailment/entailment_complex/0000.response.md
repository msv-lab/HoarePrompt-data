### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads a list `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows the program to efficiently determine the minimum number of cards of each type and how to distribute the coins to maximize the score.

3. **Initial Setup**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `a[0]`, which is the minimum number of cards of any type.
   - The variable `res` is initialized to `n - 1`, which represents the number of remaining card types that need to be considered.

4. **Distributing Coins**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list `a` and tries to equalize the number of cards of each type by using the available coins.
   - If the difference `dif` between the current and the next card type is zero, it decrements `res` to account for the fact that these card types are already equal.
   - If `dif` is not zero, it checks if there are enough coins to make the current and next card types equal. If so, it updates `ans` and `k` accordingly and decrements `res`.
   - If there are not enough coins, it distributes the remaining coins as evenly as possible among the current card types and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Final Adjustments**:
   - If there are still coins left after the loop, it distributes them as evenly as possible among all card types.
   - The score is then calculated by adding the number of complete permutations of length `n` that can be formed from the cards, which is `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`.
   - Finally, it adds the remaining `res` to the score.

6. **Output**:
   - The program appends the calculated score to `ans_list` and prints the results for all test cases at the end.

### Correctness:

The program appears to correctly follow the logic required to solve the problem. It ensures that the coins are used to equalize the number of cards of each type as much as possible, which is a key strategy to maximize the score. The final score calculation is also correct, considering both the complete permutations and the remaining cards.

However, there is a potential issue in the final score calculation. The line `ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)` might be incorrect because it assumes that the score is based on the number of complete permutations of length `n` plus the remaining cards. This might not always be the case, especially if the distribution of coins is not optimal.

### Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the final score calculation. Specifically, the line `ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)` might overestimate the score in some cases. The correct approach should be to calculate the score based on the number of complete permutations of length `n` that can be formed, and then add the remaining cards that can form partial permutations.

To fix this, the final score calculation should be adjusted to correctly account for the number of complete permutations and the remaining cards.
