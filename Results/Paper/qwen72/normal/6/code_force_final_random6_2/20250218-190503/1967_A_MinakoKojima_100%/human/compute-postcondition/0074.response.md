Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer that can be 0 or not 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans` is now the first element of the list `a`, `ans_list` is a list that now contains the value of `ans` as its last element, and `res` is now `n - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated to `n - 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `ans`, and `ans_list`) retain their initial values or conditions.
