Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is not 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans` is the final value after the loop has completed and is increased by `k // n`, `ans_list` is a list that contains the value of `ans` as its last element, `res` is increased by `k % n`.**

The value of `res` is increased by the remainder of `k` divided by `n`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
