Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first input integer greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `ans` is now equal to the first element of `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `ans_list` is a list that contains the updated value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 0, `dif` is the difference between the second and first elements of `a`, the current value of `dif` is not 0, `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` remains equal to `n - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
