Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans` is the final value after the loop has completed and is now equal to `ans + res`, `res` is unchanged, `ans_list` is a list that contains the updated value of `ans` as its last element.**

Explanation: The code `ans_list.append(ans)` adds the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_list`. The value of `ans` is the final value after the loop has completed and is now equal to `ans + res`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans_list` now includes the updated value of `ans` as its last element, while all other conditions and values remain the same.
