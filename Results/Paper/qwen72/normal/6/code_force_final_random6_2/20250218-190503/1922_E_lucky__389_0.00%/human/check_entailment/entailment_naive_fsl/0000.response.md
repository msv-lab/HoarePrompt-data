Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when `X` is a power of 2. For example, if `X = 4`, the program should output an array with exactly 4 increasing subsequences. However, the program will subtract 1 from `X` and then try to find a combination of subsequence lengths that sum up to `X - 1`. This will lead to incorrect results because the program does not account for the fact that a single element in the array can form an increasing subsequence, and it should not subtract 1 from `X` at the beginning.

For `X = 4`, the correct output should be an array like `[0, 1, 2]`, which has exactly 4 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[2]`, `[0, 1]`, `[0, 2]`, `[1, 2]`, and `[0, 1, 2]`. However, the program will output an incorrect array.
