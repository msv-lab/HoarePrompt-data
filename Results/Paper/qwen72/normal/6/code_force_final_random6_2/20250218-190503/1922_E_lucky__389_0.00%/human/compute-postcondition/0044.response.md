Output State: **`i` is the highest integer such that \(2^{(i+1)} - 1 \leq x`, `x` is the input integer minus 1, and `mx` is the maximum of the previous `mx` and the final value of `i`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop will continue to increment `i` until \(2^{(i+1)}\) is greater than `x + 1`.
- The final value of `i` will be the largest integer for which \(2^{(i+1)} - 1\) is less than or equal to `x`.
- The value of `x` remains unchanged from the initial state, which is the input integer minus 1.
- The value of `mx` will be the maximum of its initial value and the final value of `i` after the loop has completed.
