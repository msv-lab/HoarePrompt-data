### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires constructing an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences, where \( X \) is a positive integer in the range \([2, 10^{18}]\).
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
   - The empty subsequence is considered an increasing subsequence, so the program needs to account for \( X - 1 \) non-empty increasing subsequences.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` to solve the problem.
   - Inside `func_1`, the integer \( x \) is read, and 1 is subtracted from it to account for the empty subsequence.
   - The program then tries to decompose \( x \) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1. This is done by repeatedly finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( x + 1 \), subtracting \( 2^i - 1 \) from \( x \), and recording the length \( i \) of the subsequence.
   - The lengths of these subsequences are stored in the list `subseq_lens`.
   - The maximum length \( mx \) of these subsequences is tracked to determine the range of the array elements.
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by first adding integers from 0 to \( mx - 1 \) and then appending the lengths from `subseq_lens`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - **Subsequence Counting**: The number of increasing subsequences in an array of length \( n \) where the elements are distinct and strictly increasing is \( 2^n \). This is because each element can either be included or excluded in a subsequence.
   - **Decomposition**: The program decomposes \( x \) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1. This is a valid approach because any integer \( x \) can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2, and subtracting 1 from each power of 2 allows us to count the increasing subsequences correctly.
   - **Array Construction**: The array is constructed to ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches \( X \). The elements are chosen to be distinct and in increasing order, which ensures that the subsequences are counted correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( x \) is 0 by breaking out of the loop, which is correct because \( x \) is initially \( X - 1 \).
   - The program ensures that the array length is at most 200, which is within the problem constraints.
   - The program ensures that the array elements are in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), which is within the problem constraints.

5. **Output Verification**:
   - The program prints the length of the constructed array and the array itself.
   - The array elements are in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), which is within the problem constraints.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**:
  - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
  - The integer \( x \) is read and 1 is subtracted from it to account for the empty subsequence.
  - `subseq_lens` is initialized as an empty list to store the lengths of the subsequences.
  - `mx` is initialized to 0 to track the maximum length of the subsequences.

- **Decomposition Loop**:
  - The loop continues until \( x \) becomes 0.
  - Inside the loop, the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( x + 1 \) is found.
  - The length \( i \) of this subsequence is appended to `subseq_lens`.
  - \( 2^i - 1 \) is subtracted from \( x \) to account for the subsequences of length \( i \).
  - `mx` is updated to the maximum length found.

- **Array Construction**:
  - The array `ansv` is constructed by adding integers from 0 to \( mx - 1 \).
  - Additional elements from `subseq_lens` are appended to `ansv` to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.

- **Final Output**:
  - The length of `ansv` is printed.
  - The elements of `ansv` are printed on the next line.

### Challenges to the Original Assessment:

- **Subsequence Counting**:
  - The original assessment correctly states that the number of increasing subsequences in an array of length \( n \) is \( 2^n \).
  - However, the program's approach of decomposing \( x \) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1 is not entirely clear. The program should ensure that the constructed array has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences, including the empty subsequence.

- **Array Construction**:
  - The program constructs the array `ansv` by adding integers from 0 to \( mx - 1 \) and then appending the lengths from `subseq_lens`.
  - This approach is valid, but it is crucial to verify that the constructed array indeed has \( X \) increasing subsequences.

### Verification:

- **Example 1: \( X = 2 \)**
  - \( x = 1 \)
  - No powers of 2 minus 1 can be subtracted from \( x \), so the loop breaks.
  - `subseq_lens` is empty.
  - `mx` is 0.
  - `ansv` is `[0]`.
  - The length of `ansv` is 1.
  - The array is `[0]`.
  - The number of increasing subsequences is \( 2^1 = 2 \) (including the empty subsequence).

- **Example 2: \( X = 5 \)**
  - \( x = 4 \)
  - \( 2^2 - 1 = 3 \) is subtracted from \( x \), so `subseq_lens` is `[2]`.
  - \( x = 1 \)
  - \( 2^1 - 1 = 1 \) is subtracted from \( x \), so `subseq_lens` is `[2, 1]`.
  - `mx` is 2.
  - `ansv` is `[0, 1, 2]`.
  - The length of `ansv` is 3.
  - The array is `[0, 1, 2]`.
  - The number of increasing subsequences is \( 2^3 = 8 \) (including the empty subsequence).

- **Example 3: \( X = 13 \)**
  - \( x = 12 \)
  - \( 2^3 - 1 = 7 \) is subtracted from \( x \), so `subseq_lens` is `[3]`.
  - \( x = 5 \)
  - \( 2^2 - 1 = 3 \) is subtracted from \( x \), so `subseq_lens` is `[3, 2]`.
  - \( x = 2 \)
  - \( 2^1 - 1 = 1 \) is subtracted from \( x \), so `subseq_lens` is `[3, 2, 1]`.
  - `mx` is 3.
  - `ansv` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`.
  - The length of `ansv` is 6.
  - The array is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`.
  - The number of increasing subsequences is \( 2^6 = 64 \) (including the empty subsequence).

- **Example 4: \( X = 37 \)**
  - \( x = 36 \)
  - \( 2^5 - 1 = 31 \) is subtracted from \( x \), so `subseq_lens` is `[5]`.
  - \( x = 5 \)
  - \( 2^2 - 1 = 3 \) is subtracted from \( x \), so `subseq_lens` is `[5, 2]`.
  - \( x = 2 \)
  - \( 2^1 - 1 = 1 \) is subtracted from \( x \), so `subseq_lens` is `[5, 2, 1]`.
  - `mx` is 5.
  - `ansv` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 1]`.
  - The length of `ansv` is 8.
  - The array is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 1]`.
  - The number of increasing subsequences is \( 2^8 = 256 \) (including the empty subsequence).

### Conclusion:

The program's approach of decomposing \( x \) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1 and constructing the array `ansv` is correct. However, the examples provided in the verification show that the
