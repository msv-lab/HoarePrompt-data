Output State: **`x` is an input integer minus 1 and `x` must be greater than or equal to 2^i - 1, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is the largest integer such that 2^i - 1 ≤ x, and the current value of `i` is 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
