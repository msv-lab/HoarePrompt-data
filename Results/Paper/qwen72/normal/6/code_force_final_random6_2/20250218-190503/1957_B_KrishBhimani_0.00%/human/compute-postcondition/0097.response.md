Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 0, `arr` is [], `c` is 3, `ans` is [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0] (where the number of zeros appended is `n - len(ans)`).**

The code snippet `arr = []` reassigns the variable `arr` to an empty list, overriding its previous value of `[0, 1]`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
