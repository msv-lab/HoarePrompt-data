Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `arr` must contain at least two elements, `c` is increased by 1. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing a single element which is equal to `k0` and the element `1 << i`, and `ans` now includes an additional element `k0 - sum(ans)`. If `c` is not equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing the element `1 << i`. In both cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
