Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 1, `arr` is [0, 1], `c` is 1, `ans` is [2, `k0` - 2]**.

Explanation:
- The initial state is: `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 1, `arr` is [0, 1], `c` is 1, `ans` is [2].
- The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`.
- The sum of `ans` before the operation is `2` (since `ans` is [2]).
- Therefore, the new value appended to `ans` is `k0 - 2`.
- The updated `ans` list is [2, `k0` - 2].
- All other variables remain unchanged.
