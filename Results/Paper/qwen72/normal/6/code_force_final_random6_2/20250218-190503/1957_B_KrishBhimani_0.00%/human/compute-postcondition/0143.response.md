Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. For each test case, it generates a list `ans` of length `n` such that the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k`. The list `ans` contains powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of set bits in the binary representation of `k`, and if necessary, the last element is adjusted to ensure the sum equals `k`. Any remaining positions in `ans` are filled with zeros. The function prints the elements of `ans` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, `k` being 0, and `ans` being the final list for the last test case. **
