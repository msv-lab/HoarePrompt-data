Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l1 = input().split()
    n, k = list(map(int, l1))
    arr = []
    k0 = k
    i = 0
    while k:
        if k & 1 == 1:
            arr.append(i)
        k = k >> 1
        i += 1
    ans = []
    c = 0
    for i in arr:
        if c == n - 1:
            ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
            break
        c += 1
        ans.append(1 << i)
    ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `arr` contains all the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`. If `c` reaches `n - 1`, the last element of `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)`, and the loop breaks. `c` is equal to the number of elements in `ans`. `ans` is now padded with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 1, t is greater than 0, l1 is a list of strings obtained from the input, n is the integer value of the first element in l1, k is 1, k0 is the integer value of the second element in l1, i is 0, arr is [0, 1], c is 3, ans is [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0] (where the number of zeros appended is `n - len(ans)`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, t is greater than 0, l1 is a list of strings obtained from the input, n is the integer value of the first element in l1, k is 0, k0 is the integer value of the second element in l1 and must have at least one 1 in its binary representation, i is the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing the values 1 << i for each i in arr, and if c is equal to n - 1, ans also contains the value k0 - sum(ans), and ans has been extended with (n - len(ans)) zeros.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
