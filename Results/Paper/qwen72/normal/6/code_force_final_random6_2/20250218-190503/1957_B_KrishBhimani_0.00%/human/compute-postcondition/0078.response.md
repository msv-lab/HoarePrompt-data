Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 1, `arr` is [0], `c` is 1, `ans` is [2].**

The value `1 << i` (which is `1 << 1`) equals 2, and this value is appended to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
