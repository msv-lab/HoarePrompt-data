Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `arr` must contain at least two elements, `c` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans` is a list that now includes the value `1 << i` (which is `2` raised to the power of `i`).**
