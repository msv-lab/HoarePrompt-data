Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 0, `arr` is [0, 1], `c` is 3, `ans` is [2, 2].** 

The value of `c` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition to update `ans` and break out of the loop or if statement has not been met, as `c` is now 3, which is not equal to `n - 1`.
