Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 2 (and rounded down if necessary) and must be greater than 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 1, `c` is 3, `ans` is [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0] (where the number of zeros appended is `n - len(ans)`), `arr` is [1].**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `arr`. The initial state of `arr` was either [0] if `k` was odd or an empty list if `k` was even. After appending `i`, `arr` becomes [1] regardless of its initial state. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
