The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` must contain at least two elements, and `i` is the second element of `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must contain at least 3 elements, and `i` will be the third element of `arr`.

State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `arr` must contain at least three elements, `c` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans` is a list that now includes the value `1 << i` (which is `2` raised to the power of `i`).**
