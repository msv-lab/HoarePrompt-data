Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `arr` contains all the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`. If `c` reaches `n - 1`, the last element of `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)`, and the loop breaks. `c` is equal to the number of elements in `ans`. `ans` is now padded with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l1 = input().split()` updates the value of `l1` to a list of strings obtained from the input.
- The initial state specifies that `l1` is already a list of strings obtained from the input, so this code does not change the state of `l1` beyond what was already specified.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `arr`, `ans`, `c`) remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with `l1` explicitly stated as a list of strings obtained from the input.
