To determine what will be printed by the `print(a)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the transformation applied to the list `a`.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

### Transformation:
- Elements at even indices of the list `a` are reversed.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List Construction**:
   - The list `a` is initially constructed as `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.

2. **Indexing and Reversal**:
   - In Python, indices start from 0.
   - Even indices are 0, 2, 4, 6, etc.
   - The elements at these even indices are reversed.

3. **Reversal Process**:
   - To reverse elements at even indices, we need to identify these elements and reverse their order.
   - For example, if `n = 5`, the list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - The elements at even indices are `[1, 3, 5]`.
   - Reversing these elements gives `[5, 3, 1]`.
   - We then place these reversed elements back at their original even indices, resulting in the list `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

### General Case:
- For any `n`, the list `a` will be constructed as `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
- The elements at even indices will be reversed and placed back in their original positions.

### Final Output:
- The list `a` will have its elements at even indices reversed, while the elements at odd indices remain unchanged.

### Example:
- If `n = 3`, the list `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - Even indices: `[1, 3]` (reversed to `[3, 1]`).
  - Final list: `[3, 2, 1]`.

- If `n = 4`, the list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
  - Even indices: `[1, 3]` (reversed to `[3, 1]`).
  - Final list: `[3, 2, 1, 4]`.

- If `n = 5`, the list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
  - Even indices: `[1, 3, 5]` (reversed to `[5, 3, 1]`).
  - Final list: `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(a)` statement will print the list `a` with elements at even indices reversed.

Output: **[5, 2, 3, 4, 1] (where the elements at even indices of the list are reversed, and the list contains integers from 1 to n inclusive)**.
