### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Inside `func_1`, it reads the integer `n` for the current test case using `int(input())`.
   - It creates a list `a` containing the integers from 1 to `n` using `list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))`.

3. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list `a` using `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]`.
   - This means that the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, etc., are reversed in their order.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the modified list `a`.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The problem requires a permutation of length `n` such that there do not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the elements at even indices are no longer in their original order. This helps in breaking the divisibility pattern.
   - For example, if `n = 4`, the original list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. After reversing the even indices, the list becomes `[4, 2, 3, 1]`. This permutation does not have any two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - Similarly, for `n = 3`, the original list is `[1, 2, 3]`. After reversing the even indices, the list becomes `[3, 2, 1]`. This permutation also does not have any two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the range of `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, which is within the constraints.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Input Handling**:
  - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over them, which is correct.

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function reads `n` and creates a list `a` of integers from 1 to `n`, which is correct.

- **Permutation Construction**:
  - The key operation `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at even indices. This operation is intended to break the divisibility pattern.
  - Let's analyze this operation in detail:
    - For `n = 4`, the original list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Reversing the even indices results in `[4, 2, 3, 1]`.
    - For `n = 5`, the original list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. Reversing the even indices results in `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.
    - For `n = 6`, the original list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. Reversing the even indices results in `[6, 2, 4, 4, 2, 1]` (which is incorrect because it contains duplicate elements).

- **Potential Issue**:
  - The operation `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` is intended to reverse the elements at even indices, but it can lead to incorrect results if the list length is even. For example, for `n = 6`, the list becomes `[6, 2, 4, 4, 2, 1]`, which is not a valid permutation because it contains duplicate elements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect because the program does not always produce a valid permutation. Specifically, the operation `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` can lead to duplicate elements in the list when `n` is even, which violates the definition of a permutation.

Final: **False**
