The function `solve` does not take any input parameters. However, it is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the permutation p. The number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
