The code snippet `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of the list `a`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `a[::2]` selects all elements at even indices of the list `a`.
- `a[::2][::-1]` reverses the selected elements.
- The reversed elements are then assigned back to the even indices of `a`.

Since `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), the list `a` initially contains the values `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.

After the code execution:
- The elements at even indices of `a` are reversed.
- The elements at odd indices of `a` remain unchanged.
- The length of `a` remains `n`.

For example, if `n = 5`, the initial list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. After the code execution, the list `a` becomes `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), with elements at even indices reversed.**
