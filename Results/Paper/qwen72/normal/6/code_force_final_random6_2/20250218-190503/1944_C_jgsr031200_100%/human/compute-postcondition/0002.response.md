Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `n` is the length of `arr` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `freq` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `freq[i]` is now 1.**

Explanation: The code `freq[i] += 1` increments the value at the index `i` in the list `freq` by 1. Since `i` is the first element of `arr`, and `freq` is initially a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, the value at `freq[i]` is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
