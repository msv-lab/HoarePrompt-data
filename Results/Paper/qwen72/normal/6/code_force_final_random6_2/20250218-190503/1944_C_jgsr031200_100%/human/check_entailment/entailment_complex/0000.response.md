### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game and MEX:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game where they take turns removing elements from an array `a`. Alice appends the element to a new array `c`, and Bob simply removes the element.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game, where MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Alice will always try to include the smallest possible integers in `c` to delay the appearance of the smallest missing integer.
   - Bob will try to remove the smallest possible integers to make them unavailable for Alice to include in `c`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.
   - It first creates a frequency array `freq` where `freq[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the frequency array to find the first integer `i` that either has a frequency of 0 or is the second unique integer that appears exactly once.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Frequency Calculation:**
     - The program correctly calculates the frequency of each integer in `arr` and stores it in `freq`.
   - **Finding the MEX:**
     - The program iterates through the frequency array from 0 to `n`.
     - It keeps a counter `cou` to track the number of unique integers that appear exactly once.
     - If `freq[i]` is 0, it means `i` is not in `arr`, and it is the MEX.
     - If `freq[i]` is 1, it means `i` appears exactly once in `arr`, and Alice will include it in `c` to maximize the MEX.
     - If `cou` reaches 2, it means Alice has included two unique integers that appear exactly once, and the MEX will be the next integer `i` that is not in `arr`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in `arr` by printing `n` as the MEX.
   - It also handles the case where there are multiple integers that appear exactly once by correctly identifying the second unique integer.

6. **Correctness:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
   - The frequency array and the iteration logic are sound and match the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly determines the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem description and handle all edge cases appropriately.
