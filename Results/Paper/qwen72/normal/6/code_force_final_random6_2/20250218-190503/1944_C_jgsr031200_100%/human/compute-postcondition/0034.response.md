The code snippet `break` causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or conditional statement it is within. Since there is no loop or conditional statement explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, it is assumed that this `break` is part of a larger context that is not provided. However, based on the initial state, the values of the variables `arr`, `n`, `freq`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `cou` is not mentioned in the code snippet, so its state also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, `n` is the length of `arr` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the frequency of the integer `i` in `arr`, `i` is 2, `cou` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
