Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list.
2. `n` is the length of `arr` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5).
3. `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the frequency of the integer `i` in `arr`.
4. `i` is 0.
5. If `freq[i]` is 1, `cou` is set to 1; otherwise, `cou` remains 0.
6. The frequency of the integer `0` in `arr` is at least 2.
7. The current value of `cou` is 2 or the current value of `freq[i]` is 0.

### Analysis:
- Since `i` is 0, we need to check the value of `freq[0]`.
- According to the precondition, the frequency of the integer `0` in `arr` is at least 2. Therefore, `freq[0]` must be at least 2.
- Given that `freq[0]` is at least 2, the condition `if freq[i] is 1` will not be true.
- Therefore, `cou` will remain 0.
- However, the precondition also states that the current value of `cou` is 2 or the current value of `freq[i]` is 0. Since `freq[0]` is at least 2, the only way this precondition can be true is if `cou` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(i)
```

### Output:
- The variable `i` is 0, as specified in the initial state.

Output: **0**
