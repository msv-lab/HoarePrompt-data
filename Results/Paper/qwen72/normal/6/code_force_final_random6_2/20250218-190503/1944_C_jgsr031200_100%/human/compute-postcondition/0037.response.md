The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). The function returns a specific value based on the input list `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers, where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 200,000. It returns a value based on the elements of `arr`.**
