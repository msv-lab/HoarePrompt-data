Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, `n` is the length of `arr` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the frequency of the integer `i` in `arr`, `i` is 2, `cou` is increased by 1.**

The code snippet `cou += 1` increments the value of `cou` by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this change in `cou` while keeping all other initial conditions intact.
