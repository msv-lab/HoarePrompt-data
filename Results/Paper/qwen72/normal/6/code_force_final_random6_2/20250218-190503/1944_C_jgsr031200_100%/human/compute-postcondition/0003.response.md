The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `arr`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `arr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element of `arr`, and `freq[i]` is now 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be the second element of `arr`, and the loop will execute if `arr` has at least 2 elements.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `n` is the length of `arr` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `freq` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `freq[i]` is now 1**
