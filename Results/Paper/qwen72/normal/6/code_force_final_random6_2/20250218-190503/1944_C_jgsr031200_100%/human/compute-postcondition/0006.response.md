Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `n` is the length of `arr` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `freq` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `freq[i]` is now 3.** 

The value of `freq[i]` is incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
