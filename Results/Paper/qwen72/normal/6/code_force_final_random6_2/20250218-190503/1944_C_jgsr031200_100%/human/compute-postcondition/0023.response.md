The value of `cou` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, `n` is the length of `arr` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the frequency of the integer `i` in `arr`, `i` is 1, `cou` is 1. If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.
