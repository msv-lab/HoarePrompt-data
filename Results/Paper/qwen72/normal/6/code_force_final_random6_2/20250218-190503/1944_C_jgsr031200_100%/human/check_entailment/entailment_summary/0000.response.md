Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of finding the final score of the game based on the optimal play of Alice and Bob. The final score is the MEX of the array `c` that Alice constructs during the game. The key insight here is that Alice and Bob will play optimally, and the MEX of `c` will be determined by the smallest non-negative integer that is not included in `c` by the end of the game.

The function `func_1` works as follows:
1. It creates a frequency list `freq` to count the occurrences of each integer in the input array `arr`.
2. It iterates through the integers from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
3. For each integer `i`:
   - If `i` appears at least twice in `arr`, it is skipped because Alice can always ensure that this integer is included in `c`.
   - If `i` appears exactly once, a counter `cou` is incremented.
   - If `cou` reaches 2 (indicating that two unique integers have appeared exactly once) or `i` has a frequency of 0, the function prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

This logic is based on the idea that:
- If an integer appears at least twice, Alice can always pick it to include in `c`.
- If an integer appears exactly once, Bob can prevent Alice from picking it by picking it himself, but Alice can still ensure that the next smallest integer that appears exactly once is included in `c`.
- The first integer `i` that either appears exactly once and is the second such integer, or does not appear at all, will be the MEX of `c`.

The program correctly handles the given constraints and test cases. It ensures that the MEX is calculated based on the optimal play of both players, and the output matches the expected results for the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
