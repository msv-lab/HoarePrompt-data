Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user input, `t` must be greater than 2, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers `b` and `x` as provided by the user input, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers, `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `queries = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the `queries` variable to a list of integers provided by the user input.
- The initial state specifies that `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers, and this remains valid after the code execution.
- The values of `n`, `q`, `t`, `operations`, `result`, and `_` are not affected by the code snippet.
