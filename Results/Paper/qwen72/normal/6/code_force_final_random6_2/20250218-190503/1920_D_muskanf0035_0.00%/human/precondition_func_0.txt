n is a positive integer, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value) such that op_type is 1 or 2, and value is a positive integer. If op_type is 1, then 1 <= value <= n; if op_type is 2, then 1 <= value <= 10^9. queries is a list of positive integers where each integer k satisfies 1 <= k <= min(10^18, c), and c is the size of the array after all operations.
