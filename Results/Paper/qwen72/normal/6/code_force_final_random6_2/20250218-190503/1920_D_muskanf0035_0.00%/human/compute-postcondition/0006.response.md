To determine what will be printed by the `print(*result)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the context in which the `result` variable is defined.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `n` and `q` are positive integers provided by user input.
- `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each sublist contains two integers `b` and `x`. The value of `b` is either 1 or 2, and `x` is constrained by the value of `b`:
  - If `b` is 1, then \(1 \leq x \leq n\).
  - If `b` is 2, then \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\).
- `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by user input, where each integer \(k_i\) is such that \(1 \leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c)\) and `c` is the size of the array after all operations.
- `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

### Analysis:
- The function `func_1(n, operations, queries)` is not provided, so we can only infer its behavior based on the given context.
- The `operations` list contains a series of operations that modify an array. Each operation is defined by a pair `[b, x]`:
  - If `b` is 1, it likely adds `x` to the array.
  - If `b` is 2, it likely performs some other operation on the array, possibly involving the value `x`.
- The `queries` list contains a series of queries, each of which is an integer \(k_i\) that is used to query the state of the array after all operations have been applied.
- The `result` variable is the output of `func_1`, which processes the `operations` and `queries` to produce a list of results.

### Output:
- The `print(*result)` statement will unpack the `result` list and print its elements separated by spaces.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the function's behavior:

Output: **[result_1] [result_2] ... [result_q] (where each [result_i] is the result of the i-th query after applying all operations to the array)**

This means that the output will be a sequence of values, each corresponding to the result of a query on the array after all operations have been applied. The exact values of these results depend on the specific implementation of `func_1`.
