Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n`, a list of operations where each operation is a tuple `(op_type, value)`, and a list of queries. It modifies an internal array based on the operations provided: if `op_type` is 1, it appends `value` to the array; if `op_type` is 2, it duplicates the current array. After processing all operations, it returns a list `result` where each element corresponds to the value at the index `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each query `k` in `queries`. The final state of the program includes a modified `array` and a populated `result` list, while `n` and `operations` remain unchanged. **
