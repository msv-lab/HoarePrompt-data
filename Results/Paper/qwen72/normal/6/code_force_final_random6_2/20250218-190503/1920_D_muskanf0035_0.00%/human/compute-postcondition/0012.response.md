To determine what will be printed by the `print(*result)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` and `q` are positive integers provided by user input.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000 and `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each sublist contains two integers `b` and `x`:
     - `b` is either 1 or 2.
     - For `b` = 1, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= `n`.
     - For `b` = 2, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^9.
   - `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by user input, where each integer `k_i` is such that 1 <= `k_i` <= min(10^18, `c`), and `c` is the size of the array after all operations.
   - `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.
   - `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).

2. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.
   - Based on the operations and queries, `func_1` likely performs some operations on an array and then processes the queries to produce a result.
   - The exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, but we can infer that it returns a list of results corresponding to the queries.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(*result)` statement will unpack the list `result` and print its elements separated by spaces.

4. **Output Description**:
   - Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of the elements in `result`.
   - However, we can describe the output based on the structure of the problem:
     - `result` is a list of values, each corresponding to a query in the `queries` list.
     - Each value in `result` is the result of processing the corresponding query after applying all the operations.

Given this information, the output of the `print(*result)` statement will be the unpacked list of results from the function `func_1`.

Output: **[result_1] [result_2] ... [result_q] (where each [result_i] is the result of processing the corresponding query in the `queries` list after applying all the operations)**
