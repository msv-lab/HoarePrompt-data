Output State: **`t` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains two integers b and x with b in {1, 2} and 1 <= x <= n for b=1 and 1 <= x <= 10^9 for b=2, `queries` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= k_i <= min(10^18, c) where c is the size of the array after all operations.**
