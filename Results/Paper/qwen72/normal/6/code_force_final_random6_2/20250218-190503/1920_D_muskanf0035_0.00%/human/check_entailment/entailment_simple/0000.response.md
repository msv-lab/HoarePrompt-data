### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the operations and queries, and calls `func_1` to process the operations and generate the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function initializes an empty array `array` and an empty result list `result`.
   - It iterates through each operation:
     - If the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the array.
     - If the operation type is 2, it appends `x` copies of the current array to itself. This is done using a list comprehension that extends the array with its own elements repeated `x` times.
   - After processing all operations, it iterates through the queries and appends the element at the index `(k - 1) % len(array)` to the result list. This ensures that the query index wraps around if it exceeds the length of the array.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly:
     - `1 <= t <= 5000`
     - `1 <= n, q <= 10^5`
     - `1 <= x <= n` for operation type 1
     - `1 <= x <= 10^9` for operation type 2
     - `1 <= k_i <= min(10^18, c)` where `c` is the size of the array after all operations.
   - The program ensures that the array is modified according to the operations and that the queries are processed correctly.

4. **Efficiency:**
   - The program is efficient in terms of the given constraints. The operations and queries are processed in linear time relative to the number of operations and queries.
   - The use of list comprehension in the operation type 2 ensures that the array is extended correctly without creating intermediate lists.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly simulates the operations and queries as described in the problem statement.
   - The use of modulo operation in the query processing ensures that the program handles large indices efficiently.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement. It processes the operations and queries as specified and handles the constraints efficiently.
