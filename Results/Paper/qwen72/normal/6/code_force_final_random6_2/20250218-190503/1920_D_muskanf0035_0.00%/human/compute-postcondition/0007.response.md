The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter for the `range(t)` loop. The loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, and `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.

Given that the loop has already executed once, `_` must have been 0 at the start of the previous iteration and is now 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `t`.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user input, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers `b` and `x` with `b` in {1, 2} and 1 <= `x` <= `n` for `b`=1 and 1 <= `x` <= 10^9 for `b`=2, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user input, where each integer `k_i` is such that 1 <= `k_i` <= min(10^18, `c`) and `c` is the size of the array after all operations, `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is 1, and `t` must be greater than 1**.
