Output State: **`t` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user input, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers `b` and `x` with `b` in {1, 2} and 1 <= `x` <= `n` for `b`=1 and 1 <= `x` <= 10^9 for `b`=2, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers such that 1 <= `k_i` <= min(10^18, `c`) where `c` is the size of the array after all operations.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet reads `n` lines of input and converts each line into a list of two integers, which are then stored in the `operations` list.
- The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer provided by the user input, so the `operations` list will contain exactly `n` sublists.
- Each sublist in `operations` will contain two integers `b` and `x`, where `b` is either 1 or 2, and `x` is within the specified ranges based on the value of `b`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and `queries` remain unchanged, as they are not directly modified by this code snippet.
