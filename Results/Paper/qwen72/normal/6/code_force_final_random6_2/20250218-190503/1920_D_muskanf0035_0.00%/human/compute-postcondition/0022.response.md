Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of tuples with all tuples processed, `array` is a list that has been modified according to the operations in `operations`, `result` is a list containing the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` of `array` appended three times, `queries` must have at least 3 elements, `k` is the third element in `queries`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains a positive integer.
- The list `operations` remains processed with all tuples.
- The list `array` remains modified according to the operations in `operations`.
- The list `result` initially contained the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` of `array` appended twice. After executing the code, the same element is appended one more time, making it three times in total.
- The list `queries` still has at least 3 elements.
- The value of `k` remains the third element in `queries`.
