### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying a critical flaw in the implementation of the second type of operation (b=2). Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - Operation 1 (b=1): Append an integer `x` to the array.
   - Operation 2 (b=2): Append `x` copies of the current array to itself. This means the array should be repeated `x` times.

2. **Program Code Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The function processes the operations and queries.
     - For operation 1 (b=1), it correctly appends the integer `x` to the array.
     - For operation 2 (b=2), it incorrectly appends only one copy of the array to itself. The line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` should be `array.extend(array * value)` to append `x` copies of the array.

3. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases and processes each one using `func_1`.
   - It correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - The issue lies in the implementation of `func_1`, not in `func_2`.

4. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - The provided test case:
     ```
     1
     5 5
     1 1
     1 2
     2 3
     1 3
     2 2
     1 2 3 4 5
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     1 2 1 2 3
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     1 2 1 2 1
     ```
   - After the third operation (2 3), the array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]` because the array `[1, 2]` is repeated 3 times. However, the program only appends one copy, resulting in `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the second type of operation (b=2), leading to incorrect results for certain test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
