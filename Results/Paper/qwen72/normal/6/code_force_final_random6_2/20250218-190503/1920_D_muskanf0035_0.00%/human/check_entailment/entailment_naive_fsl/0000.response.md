Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the second type of operation (b=2), where the array is supposed to be appended x times to itself. The current implementation only appends one copy of the array, which is incorrect. This can be demonstrated with the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5 5
1 1
1 2
2 3
1 3
2 2
1 2 3 4 5
```

Expected Output:
```
1 2 1 2 3
```

Actual Output:
```
1 2 1 2 1
```

In the test case, after the third operation (2 3), the array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`, but the program only appends one copy of `[1, 2]` to itself, resulting in `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. This is incorrect, and the program fails to meet the problem description for this case.
