Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads multiple sets of inputs, each set containing the number of operations `n`, the number of queries `q`, a list of operations, and a list of queries. For each set, it processes the operations and queries using the function `func_1`, and prints the results of the queries. After processing all sets, the function concludes without returning any value. The final state of the program includes the processed results being printed for each set, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` are reset for the next set of inputs. **
