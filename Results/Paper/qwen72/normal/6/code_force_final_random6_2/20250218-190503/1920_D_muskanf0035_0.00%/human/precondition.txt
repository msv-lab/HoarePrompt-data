n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), operations is a list of n tuples where each tuple is of the form (b, x) with b ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ x ≤ n for b=1 and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9 for b=2, queries is a list of q positive integers (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5) where each integer k_i satisfies 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c) and c is the size of the array after all operations.
