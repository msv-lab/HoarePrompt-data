Output State: **`n` is equal to the length of the `array`, `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and all elements in `array` are distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`.**

The variable `n` is now set to the length of the `array`, which is the number of elements in the list. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
