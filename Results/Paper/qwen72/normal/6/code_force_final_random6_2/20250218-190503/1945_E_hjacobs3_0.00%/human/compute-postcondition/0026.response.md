Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `array` of distinct integers from 1 to n and an integer `find` within the same range. It returns a list of two strings: the first string is the smallest index (plus 1) where the element in `array` is greater than or equal to `find`, and the second string is the index (plus 1) of `find` in `array`. If `find` is not found in `array`, the function still returns the smallest index (plus 1) where the element in `array` is greater than or equal to `find`, and the index (plus 1) where `find` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order. **
