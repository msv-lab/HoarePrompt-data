Output State: **`n` is equal to the length of the `array`, `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and all elements in `array` are distinct integers from 1 to `n`. `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`. `l` is the smallest index in `array` such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`, or `l` is `n` if `find` is greater than all elements in `array`. `r` is the largest index in `array` such that `array[r]` is less than `find`, or `r` is `-1` if `find` is less than or equal to all elements in `array`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `l` will point to the smallest index in the `array` where the element is greater than or equal to `find`, or it will be `n` if `find` is greater than all elements in the `array`. The variable `r` will point to the largest index in the `array` where the element is less than `find`, or it will be `-1` if `find` is less than or equal to all elements in the `array`. The other variables (`n`, `array`, and `find`) remain unchanged.
