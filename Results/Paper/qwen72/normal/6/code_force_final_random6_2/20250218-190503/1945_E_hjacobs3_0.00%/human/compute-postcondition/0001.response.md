Output State: **`n` is equal to the length of the `array`, `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and all elements in `array` are distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

The initial state remains unchanged, but the variables `l` and `r` are now assigned specific values. `l` is set to 0, and `r` is set to `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the `array`.
