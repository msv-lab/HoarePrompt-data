### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `M` to \(10^9 + 7\) for the modulo operation.
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is the probability of selecting any specific pair of children, given that there are \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) possible pairs.

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - It initializes `a` to 0, which will store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs.
   - It reads `m` lines, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, and adds these values to `a`.

3. **Calculating the Expected Sum:**
   - It initializes `s` to 0, which will store the expected sum of friendship values over all excursions.
   - For each of the `k` excursions, it updates `s` by adding the expected increase in friendship value for that excursion.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for a given excursion is calculated as:
     - `c * i * c * m`: This term is incorrect. It should be `c * (a + i * m)`, where `a` is the initial sum of friendship values and `i * m` is the increase in friendship value due to the pairs being chosen in previous excursions.

4. **Output:**
   - After calculating the expected sum `s` for all `k` excursions, it prints `s % M`.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
  - The calculation of `c` using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` because the number of pairs is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), not \( n(n-1) \).

- **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
  - The loop that sums the initial friendship values of all pairs is correct.

- **Expected Sum Calculation:**
  - The loop that calculates the expected sum `s` for each excursion is incorrect. The term `c * i * c * m` is not the correct way to calculate the expected increase in friendship value. The correct term should be `c * (a + i * m)`, where `a` is the initial sum of friendship values and `i * m` is the increase in friendship value due to the pairs being chosen in previous excursions.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % M
        s = 0
        for i in range(k):
            s = (s + c * (a + i * m)) % M
        print(s % M)
```

### Correctness:

- The original program has two logical errors:
  1. The calculation of `c` should use \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) instead of \( n(n-1) \).
  2. The expected sum calculation should use `c * (a + i * m)` instead of `c * i * c * m`.

- The corrected program correctly calculates the expected sum of friendship values for all excursions.

### Final Answer:

Final: **False**
