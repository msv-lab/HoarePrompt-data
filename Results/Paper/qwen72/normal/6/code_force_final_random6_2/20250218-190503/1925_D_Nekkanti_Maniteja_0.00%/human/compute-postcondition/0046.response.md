Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is `k - 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is updated to `s + c * (k - 1) * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations, `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with the final values provided by the user in the last iteration, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, and the input value must be greater than `k - 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `k` iterations, the following state is true:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 50,000.
- The variable `i` is now `k - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration.
- The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their initial values as provided by the user.
- The variable `M` remains 1000000007, which is used for modular arithmetic.
- The variable `c` remains the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.
- The variable `s` has been updated to include the sum of the expressions `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = k - 1`.
- The variable `a` remains the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations.
- The variables `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with the final values provided by the user in the last iteration.
- The conditions `m` ≥ 3 and `k` ≥ 3 still hold.
- The input value must still be greater than `k - 1` to ensure the loop executes at least `k` times.
