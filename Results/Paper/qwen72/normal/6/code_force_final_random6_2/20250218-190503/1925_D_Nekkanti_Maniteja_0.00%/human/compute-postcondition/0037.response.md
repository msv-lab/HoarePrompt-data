Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50000, `i` is 2, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `f + f`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers provided by the user, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, and the input value must be greater than `k - 1`.**

The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are now integers provided by the user. The other variables remain unchanged.
