Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the friendship values. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the sum `s` in the loop where it iterates over the excursions. The logic for updating the friendship values and calculating the expected sum is flawed.

Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
2 1 2
1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
- There are 2 children, 1 pair of friends, and 2 excursions.
- The initial friendship value of the pair (1, 2) is 1.
- For the first excursion, the pair (1, 2) is chosen with probability 1 (since it's the only pair), and the friendship value becomes 2.
- For the second excursion, the pair (1, 2) is chosen again with probability 1, and the friendship value becomes 3.
- The expected sum of friendship values for the two excursions is 1 (first excursion) + 3 (second excursion) = 4.

However, the program calculates the sum incorrectly, leading to an output of 3 instead of 4. This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the friendship values.
