You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is `k - 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is updated to `s + c * (0 * m + 1 * m + 2 * m + ... + (k-1) * m) + c * a * k`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations, `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with the final values provided by the user in the last iteration, `m` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`. For each test case, it reads `m` lines of input, each containing the indices of a pair of children who are friends and their initial friendship value. The function calculates a value `s` using modular arithmetic, where `s` is updated based on the sum of friendship values and the number of excursions. After processing all test cases, the function prints the final value of `s` for each test case, modulo `10^9 + 7`. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the friendship values. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the sum `s` in the loop where it iterates over the excursions. The logic for updating the friendship values and calculating the expected sum is flawed.

Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
2 1 2
1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
- There are 2 children, 1 pair of friends, and 2 excursions.
- The initial friendship value of the pair (1, 2) is 1.
- For the first excursion, the pair (1, 2) is chosen with probability 1 (since it's the only pair), and the friendship value becomes 2.
- For the second excursion, the pair (1, 2) is chosen again with probability 1, and the friendship value becomes 3.
- The expected sum of friendship values for the two excursions is 1 (first excursion) + 3 (second excursion) = 4.

However, the program calculates the sum incorrectly, leading to an output of 3 instead of 4. This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the friendship values.
