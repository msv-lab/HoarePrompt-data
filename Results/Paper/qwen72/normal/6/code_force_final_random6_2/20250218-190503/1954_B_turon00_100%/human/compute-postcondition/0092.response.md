The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, as the input is provided through a predefined method or variable not shown in the function definition. However, it is expected to process a list of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful. The number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output for each case is not provided in the constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, and return a result for each test case based on the given inputs.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, and returns a result for each test case based on the given inputs.**
