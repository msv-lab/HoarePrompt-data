To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`.
   - `i` is `n-1`, which is the index of the last element in the list `a`.
   - `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list that are equal to `tmp` if the last element of the list `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0.
   - `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop, or `n` if no element in the list `a` is different from `tmp`.
   - `n` is not equal to 1.
   - `ans` is not equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `cnt` is calculated based on the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list that are equal to `tmp`.
   - `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop, or `n` if no element in the list `a` is different from `tmp`.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates from the end of the list `a` to the beginning, checking how many consecutive elements are equal to `tmp`.
   - If the last element of the list `a` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` starts counting the number of consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp` from the end.
   - If the last element is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is set to 0.
   - The loop continues until it finds an element that is different from `tmp`, at which point it stops and `ans` is updated with the minimum value of `cnt` encountered.
   - If no element in the list `a` is different from `tmp`, `ans` is set to `n`.

4. **Given Conditions:**
   - `n` is not equal to 1.
   - `ans` is not equal to `n`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `ans` is not equal to `n`, it means that there must be at least one element in the list `a` that is different from `tmp`.
   - Therefore, `ans` will be the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop, which is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list that are equal to `tmp` before encountering a different element.

Given the above analysis, the `print(ans)` statement will output the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop, which is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp` before encountering a different element.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum value of cnt encountered during the loop, and cnt is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list a that are equal to tmp before encountering a different element)**
