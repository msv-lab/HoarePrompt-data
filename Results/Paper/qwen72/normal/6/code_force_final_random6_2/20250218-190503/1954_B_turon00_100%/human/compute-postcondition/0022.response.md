Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is 0.**

The code snippet `cnt = 0` resets the variable `cnt` to 0, regardless of its initial value. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
