Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.**

The value of `cnt` is set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `ans` is still the minimum value between its previous value and `cnt`, which is now 0.
