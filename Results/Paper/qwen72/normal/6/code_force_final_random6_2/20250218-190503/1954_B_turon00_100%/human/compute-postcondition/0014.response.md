The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n`, so `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
