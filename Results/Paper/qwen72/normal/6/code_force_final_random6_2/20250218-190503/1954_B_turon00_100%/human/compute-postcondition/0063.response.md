Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `tmp`, `i`, `cnt`, and `ans` are not directly modified by this code.
- The initial state remains valid, with the only change being that `a` now holds a new list of integers provided by the user.
