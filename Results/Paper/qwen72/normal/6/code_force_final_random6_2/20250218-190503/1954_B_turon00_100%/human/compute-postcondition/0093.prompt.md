You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through a predefined method or variable not shown in the function definition, typically involving a list of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where the array a is guaranteed to be beautiful. The number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        tmp = a[0]
        
        cnt = 0
        
        ans = n
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == tmp:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
                cnt = 0
        
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
        if n == 1 or ans == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` is 0, and for each test case, the variable `ans` holds the minimum number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element of the list `a` for that test case, or -1 if the list `a` has only one element or all elements are the same.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, and returns a result for each test case based on the given inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
