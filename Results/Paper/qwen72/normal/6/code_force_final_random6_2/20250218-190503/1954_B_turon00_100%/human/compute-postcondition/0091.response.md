Output State: **After all iterations, `t` is 0, and for each test case, the variable `ans` holds the minimum number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element of the list `a` for that test case, or -1 if the list `a` has only one element or all elements are the same.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations:
- The variable `t` is now 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- For each test case, the variable `ans` will either be -1 if the list `a` has only one element or if all elements in the list `a` are the same, or it will hold the minimum number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element of the list `a` for that test case.
- The variables `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `cnt` will have been reset and used for each test case, but their final values after the last iteration will depend on the last test case processed. Specifically, `n` will be the length of the last list `a`, `tmp` will be the first element of the last list `a`, and `cnt` will be the number of consecutive elements at the end of the last list `a` that are equal to `tmp`, or 0 if the last element is not equal to `tmp`.
