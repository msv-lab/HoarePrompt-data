Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. The approach taken by the program is to count the maximum number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element of the array. If the array has only one element or all elements are the same, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array not beautiful. Otherwise, it prints the minimum number of such consecutive elements, which is the answer.

However, there is a flaw in the logic. The program only considers the consecutive elements that are the same as the first element, but a beautiful array can be transformed into a non-beautiful array by removing elements that are not necessarily consecutive or the same as the first element. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program would count the consecutive `1`s and output `1`, but it should actually output `1` because removing the middle `2` (at index 1) would make the array non-beautiful.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
1. If all elements in the array are the same, it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements, so the output should be `-1`.
2. If the array has only one element, it is also impossible to make it not beautiful, so the output should be `-1`.
3. For other cases, we need to find the minimum number of elements to remove such that no valid operation can be performed to make all elements the same. This can be achieved by finding the longest subarray where all elements are the same and then removing elements to break this pattern.

The current program does not correctly handle the third case, as it only considers consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is not sufficient.

Correctness: **False**
