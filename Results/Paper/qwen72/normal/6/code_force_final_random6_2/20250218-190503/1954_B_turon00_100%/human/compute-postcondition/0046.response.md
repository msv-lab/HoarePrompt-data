Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new list `a`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value (`n`) and the value of `cnt` (which is 1). Since `n` is greater than 0, `ans` will be 1 if `n` is greater than 1, or it will remain `n` if `n` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
