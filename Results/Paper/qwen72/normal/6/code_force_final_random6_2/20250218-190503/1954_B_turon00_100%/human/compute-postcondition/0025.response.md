Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list that are equal to `tmp` if the last element of the list `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop, or `n` if no element in the list `a` is different from `tmp`.** 

The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged.
