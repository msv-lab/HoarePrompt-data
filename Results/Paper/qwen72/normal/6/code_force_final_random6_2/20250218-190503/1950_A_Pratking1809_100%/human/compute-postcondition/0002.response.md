Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input, `q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**

The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are now integers provided by the user input, while the other variables (`t`, `q`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
