Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input, `q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `a < b > c` is true, then `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`. Otherwise, `a < b > c` is false, and the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` does not satisfy `a < b > c`.***
