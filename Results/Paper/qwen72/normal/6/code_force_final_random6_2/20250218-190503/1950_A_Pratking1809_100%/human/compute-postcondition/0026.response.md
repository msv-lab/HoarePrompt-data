Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input, `q` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and `i` is `q - 1`. For each iteration, if `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b` which is less than `c`. If `a < b < c` is not true, then the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` does not satisfy `a < b < c`. If `a < b > c` is true, then `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`. If `a < b > c` is false, then the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` does not satisfy `a < b > c`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input for each iteration.
- The variable `q` must be at least as large as the number of iterations that the loop has executed.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `q - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration.
- For each iteration, the conditions `a < b < c` and `a < b > c` are checked, and the appropriate output (`STAIR`, `PEAK`, or `NONE`) is printed based on the relationships between `a`, `b`, and `c`.
