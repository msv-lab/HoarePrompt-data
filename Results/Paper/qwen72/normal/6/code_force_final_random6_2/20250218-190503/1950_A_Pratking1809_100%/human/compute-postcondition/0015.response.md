The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('PEAK')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state describes the conditions for the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`:
  - If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b` which is less than `c`.
  - If `a < b > c`, then `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.
  - If `a < b > c` is false, then the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` does not satisfy `a < b > c`.

- However, the `print` statement does not depend on any of these conditions. It simply prints the string `'PEAK'`.

### Output:
The code will print the string 'PEAK'.
Output: **PEAK**
