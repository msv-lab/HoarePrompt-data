Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by user input.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- It is not the case that `a < b < c`.
- Additionally, `a < b > c` is true, meaning `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('PEAK')
```

The `print` statement simply prints the string `'PEAK'`. The conditions provided do not affect the content of the `print` statement, as it is a static string and does not depend on any variables or conditions.

Output: **PEAK**
