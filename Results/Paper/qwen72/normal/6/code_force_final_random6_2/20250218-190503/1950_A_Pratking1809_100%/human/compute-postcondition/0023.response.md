The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'NONE'`. The initial state describes the conditions and relationships between the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of these conditions and simply prints the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
