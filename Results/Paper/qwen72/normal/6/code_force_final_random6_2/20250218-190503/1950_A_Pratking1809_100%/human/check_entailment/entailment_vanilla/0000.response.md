Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases. This is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that iterates `q` times, once for each test case. This is also correct.

3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from a single line of input using `input().split()` and `map(int, ...)` to convert the input strings to integers. This is consistent with the problem description which states that each test case contains three digits separated by spaces.

4. **Condition Checking**:
   - **Stair Condition**: The program checks if `a < b < c`. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR". This correctly identifies a stair as per the problem description.
   - **Peak Condition**: The program checks if `a < b > c`. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK". This correctly identifies a peak as per the problem description.
   - **Neither Condition**: If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "NONE". This correctly handles the case where the digits do not form a stair or a peak.

5. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case, either "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions checked.

Given that the program follows the problem description and handles all the specified conditions correctly, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
