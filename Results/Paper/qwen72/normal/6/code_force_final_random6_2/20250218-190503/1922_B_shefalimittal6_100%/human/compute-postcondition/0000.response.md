Output State: **The function is now set up to read input from `sys.stdin`, but no actual input has been read or processed yet. The initial state variables `t` and the list of lists remain unchanged.**

The function is now prepared to read from standard input, but this does not change the values of `t` or the list of lists. The initial state remains the same, with `t` being an integer in the range 1 to 10^4, and the list of lists containing integers for each test case, with the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding 3 Â· 10^5.
