The value of `v[x]` is incremented by 1. The value of `x` is the integer value of `data[idx-1]`, and `idx` is `idx + 1`. The other variables (`n` and `_`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx-1]`, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx-1]`, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1.**
