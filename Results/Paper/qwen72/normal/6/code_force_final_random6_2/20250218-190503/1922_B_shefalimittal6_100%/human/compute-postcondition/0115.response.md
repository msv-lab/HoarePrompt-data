The objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`, which is still satisfied as long as `n` is at least 0.

State: **`_` is `n - 1`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + n`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1, `v` contains the counts of the values from `data` that were indexed from `idx` to `idx + n - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, `ans` is 0, `n` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, and if `v[i]` is at least 3, `ans` is `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `v[i]` remains at least 2 and `ans` remains 0.**
