Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `n + 2`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, where each element `v[i]` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the first `n` elements of `data` starting from index 2, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `i` is 0. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, the program retains this state. If `v[i]` is less than 2, the program also retains this state.**
