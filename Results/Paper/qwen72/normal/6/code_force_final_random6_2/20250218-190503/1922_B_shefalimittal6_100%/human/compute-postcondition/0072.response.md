Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by `n`, `v[x]` is incremented by `n`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
