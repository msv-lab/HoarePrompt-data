Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `v[x]` is 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`.**

The value at index `x` in the list `v` is incremented by 1, making `v[x]` equal to 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
