Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function is now set up to read input from `sys.stdin`, but no actual input has been read or processed yet. The initial state variables `t` is now the integer value of `data[0]`. The list of lists remains unchanged. `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input. `idx` is 1. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    for _ in range(n):
        x = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        v[x] += 1
    cnt = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if v[i] >= 2:
            ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
        if v[i] >= 3:
            ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
        cnt += v[i]
    results.append(str(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `n + 2`, `results` is a list containing a single string which is the string representation of `ans`, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, where each element `v[i]` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the first `n` elements of `data` starting from index 2, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `i` is `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by `n`, `v[x]` is incremented by `n`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is the sum of all values in `v` from index 0 to `n`, `ans` is the sum of all combinations of 2 and 3 from the values in `v` from index 0 to `n`, `results` includes an additional element, which is the string representation of `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is `n - 1`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + n`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1, `v` contains the counts of the values from `data` that were indexed from `idx` to `idx + n - 1`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v` from index 0 to `n`, `ans` is the sum of the combinations of counts of elements in `v` from index 0 to `n` where the count is at least 2 (combinations of 2) and at least 3 (combinations of 3), `n` must be at least 0, `i` is `n`, `results` is a list that now includes the string representation of `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
