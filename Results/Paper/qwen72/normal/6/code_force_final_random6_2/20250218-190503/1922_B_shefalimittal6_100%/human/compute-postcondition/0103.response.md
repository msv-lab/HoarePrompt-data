Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + 3`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1**

The value of `v[x]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, but the specific value of `x` is still the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, and `idx` is `idx + 3`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid. The value of `_` remains 2.
