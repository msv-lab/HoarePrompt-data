Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `n + 3`, `results` is a list containing a single string which is the string representation of `ans`, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 2]`, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `i` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `v = [0] * (n + 1)` reassigns `v` to a new list of zeros with length `n + 1`.
- The initial state indicates that `v` was previously a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, where each element `v[i]` represented the count of occurrences of `i` in the first `n` elements of `data` starting from index 2.
- After the code execution, `v` is reset to a list of zeros with the same length `n + 1`.
- The value of `cnt` is now the sum of all elements in the new list `v`, which is 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `data`, `idx`, `results`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged.
