Reasoning: The original assessment is correct. The program provided does not implement the necessary logic to determine whether three chosen sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. The function `func_1` only counts the number of ways to choose pairs and triplets of sticks with the same length, which is insufficient for the problem requirements. Specifically, the program does not check the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to form a non-degenerate triangle, the following conditions must hold:
1. \(a + b > c\)
2. \(a + c > b\)
3. \(b + c > a\)

The program's logic is flawed because it only counts combinations where at least two sticks have the same length, which does not guarantee that a non-degenerate triangle can be formed. For example, in the test case:
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```
The lengths of the sticks are \(1, 2, 4, 8\). No three of these sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle, but the program will incorrectly count some combinations as valid. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
