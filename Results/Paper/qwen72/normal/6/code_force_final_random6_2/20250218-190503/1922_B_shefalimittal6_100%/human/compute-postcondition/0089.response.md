Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by `n`, `v[x]` is incremented by `n`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is the sum of all values in `v` from index 0 to `n`, `ans` is the sum of all combinations of 2 and 3 from the values in `v` from index 0 to `n`, `results` includes an additional element, which is the string representation of `ans`, `_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`**

Explanation:
- `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`.
- `x` remains the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`.
- `idx` is incremented by the new value of `n`.
- `v[x]` is incremented by the new value of `n`.
- `i` is set to the new value of `n`.
- `cnt` remains the sum of all values in `v` from index 0 to `n`.
- `ans` remains the sum of all combinations of 2 and 3 from the values in `v` from index 0 to `n`.
- `results` still includes an additional element, which is the string representation of `ans`.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `t` must still be greater than the current value of `_`.
