Output State: **_ is `n - 1`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + n`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1, `v` contains the counts of the values from `data` that were indexed from `idx` to `idx + n - 1`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v` from index 0 to `n`, `ans` is the sum of the combinations of counts of elements in `v` from index 0 to `n` where the count is at least 2 (combinations of 2) and at least 3 (combinations of 3), `n` must be at least 0, `i` is `n`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `_` remains `n - 1`.
- The variable `x` is still the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`.
- The variable `idx` is incremented by `n` from its initial value.
- The array `v` now contains the counts of the values from `data` that were indexed from `idx` to `idx + n - 1`.
- The variable `cnt` is the sum of all elements in the array `v` from index 0 to `n`.
- The variable `ans` is the sum of the combinations of counts of elements in `v` from index 0 to `n` where the count is at least 2 (combinations of 2) and at least 3 (combinations of 3).
- The variable `n` must be at least 0.
- The loop index `i` is `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
