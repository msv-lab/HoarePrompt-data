Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `n + 2`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, where each element `v[i]` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the first `n` elements of `data` starting from index 2, `cnt` is `v[0]`, `i` is 1, `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[1] * (v[1] - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `cnt * v[1] * (v[1] - 1) // 2`.
- `cnt` is `v[0]`, which is the count of occurrences of `0` in the first `n` elements of `data` starting from index 2.
- `v[1]` is the count of occurrences of `1` in the first `n` elements of `data` starting from index 2.
- The expression `cnt * v[1] * (v[1] - 1) // 2` calculates the number of pairs of `1`s that can be formed, multiplied by the count of `0`s.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
