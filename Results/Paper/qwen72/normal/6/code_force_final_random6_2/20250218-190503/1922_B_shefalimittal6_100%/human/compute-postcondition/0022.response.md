Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `n + 2`, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, where each element `v[i]` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the first `n` elements of `data` starting from index 2.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`data`**: Remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`idx`**: After `n` iterations, `idx` will be `2 + n` because it is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- **`results`**: Remains an empty list as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains greater than 0, as it is only used to determine the number of iterations but is not modified in the loop.
- **`v`**: This list is modified in the loop. Each element `v[i]` will be the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the first `n` elements of `data` starting from index 2. The length of `v` remains `n + 1`.

Thus, after all iterations, `idx` will be `n + 2`, and `v` will contain the counts of the integers from `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`.
