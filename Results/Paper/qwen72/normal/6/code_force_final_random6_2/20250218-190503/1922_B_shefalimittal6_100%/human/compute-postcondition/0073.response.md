The value of `cnt` is incremented by `v[i]`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `idx`, `v[x]`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged. Since `v[i]` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `cnt` is now `v[i]` more than its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by `n`, `v[x]` is incremented by `n`, `cnt` is `v[i]` more than its previous value (which was 0), `i` is 0, `ans` is 0 if `v[i]` is less than 3, otherwise `ans` is `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.**
