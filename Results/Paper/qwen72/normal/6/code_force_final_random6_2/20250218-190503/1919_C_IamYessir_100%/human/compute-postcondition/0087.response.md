Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` is greater than `x`, `b` now contains the element `lit[2]` appended to it. If `b` was initially an empty list, `y` is now the last element of `b` which is `lit[2]`. If `b` was not an empty list, `y` is still the last element of `b` before the new element was appended. Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged and `y` retains its initial value.***
