Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `x` is positive infinity, `y` is positive infinity, and `s` is 0. The length of `a` is 0.**

The value of `x` is set to positive infinity, and all other variables remain unchanged. The length of `a` is still 0.
