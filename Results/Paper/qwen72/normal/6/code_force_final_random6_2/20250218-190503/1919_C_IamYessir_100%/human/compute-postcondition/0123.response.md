The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is set to 0 at the start of the loop, which is already correct for the loop to begin.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `x` is positive infinity, `y` is positive infinity, and `s` is 0.**
