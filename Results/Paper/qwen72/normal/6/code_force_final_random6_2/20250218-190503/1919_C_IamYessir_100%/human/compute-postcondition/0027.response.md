Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0. If `y` is infinity, `b` remains an empty list. If `y` is not infinity and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[0]`, `b` is a non-empty list containing the first element of `lit`, `y` is the last element of `b` (which is `lit[0]`), and `x` is greater than `y`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` is a non-empty list with `lit[i]` appended to it, `y` is the last element of `b` before the new append, and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, if `a` was an empty list, `x` was infinity, and now `a` is a list containing `lit[i]` and `x` is `lit[i]`. If `a` was a non-empty list, `x` was the last element of `a`, and now `a` is a list with `lit[i]` appended to it and `x` is `lit[i]`. `x` is always greater than `y` after the execution, unless the condition `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y` is not met, in which case the variables and lists remain unchanged.**
