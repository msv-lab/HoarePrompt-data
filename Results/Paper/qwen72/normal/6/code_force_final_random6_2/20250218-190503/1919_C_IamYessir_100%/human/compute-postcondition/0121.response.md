Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `x` is positive infinity, `y` is positive infinity, and `s` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The lists `a` and `b` are both set to empty lists.
- Since `a` is now an empty list, `x` (which is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise positive infinity) is set to positive infinity.
- Similarly, since `b` is now an empty list, `y` (which is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise positive infinity) is set to positive infinity.
- The variable `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than the previous element in `a` for all valid indices from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element in `b` for all valid indices from 1 to `len(b) - 1`. Since both `a` and `b` are empty, `s` is 0.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `lit`, and `cp` are not affected by the code.
