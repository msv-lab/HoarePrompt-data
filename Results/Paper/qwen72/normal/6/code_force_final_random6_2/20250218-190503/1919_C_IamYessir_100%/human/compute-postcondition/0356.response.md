Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `lit` of `n` integers. It then distributes the elements of `lit` into two lists `a` and `b` based on certain conditions. After processing, it calculates the total number of strictly increasing adjacent pairs in both `a` and `b` and prints this count. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the integer `t` (number of test cases), the loop counter `_` (which is `t - 1`), the last input integer `n`, the last list `lit` of integers, and the lists `a` and `b` which are sorted in non-decreasing order. The variable `s` holds the total count of strictly increasing adjacent pairs in `a` and `b`. **
