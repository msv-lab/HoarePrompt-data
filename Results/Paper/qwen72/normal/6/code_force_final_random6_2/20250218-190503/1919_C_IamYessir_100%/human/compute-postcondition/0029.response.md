Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, if `a` is a non-empty list, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `b` is an empty list, the length of `b` is 0 and `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than or equal to `y`, and the current values of `x` and `y` are equal.**
