Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements where each element is less than or equal to the next element, `b` is a list of integers where each element is less than or equal to the next element, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, and `s` is 2 if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.***
