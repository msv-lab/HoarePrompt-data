Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1. If the length of `a` is greater than 0, `x` is set to the last element of `a`; otherwise, `x` is set to infinity. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is set to infinity, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If the length of `b` is greater than 0, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it, and `x` is set to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, the state of `a` and `b` remains unchanged, and `x` and `y` retain their values based on the conditions described in the precondition.***
