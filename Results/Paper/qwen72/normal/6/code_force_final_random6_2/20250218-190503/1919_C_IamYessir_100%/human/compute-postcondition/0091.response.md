Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `cp` is 0. If `x` == `y`, `a` now contains the element `lit[2]` appended to it, and `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[2]`), while `y` remains positive infinity if `b` is an empty list or retains its last element if `b` is not empty. If `x` < `y`, then: if `x` ≥ `lit[2]`, `a` now includes the third element of `lit` as its last element, and `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[2]`). If `x` < `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` > `y`, `a` now includes the third element of `lit` as its last element, and `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[2]`). If `x` < `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` ≤ `y` and `lit[2]` > `x`, `b` now contains the element `lit[2]` appended to it, and `y` is the last element of `b` (which is `lit[2]` if `b` was initially empty). If `x` < `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` ≤ `y` and `lit[2]` ≤ `x`, `b` remains unchanged and `y` retains its initial value. If `x` ≥ `y`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.***
