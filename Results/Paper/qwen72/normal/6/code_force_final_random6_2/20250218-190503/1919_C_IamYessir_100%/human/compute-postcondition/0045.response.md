Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0. If `x` is equal to `y`, then `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `x` is the first element of `lit`, and `b` remains unchanged. If `x` is less than `y`, then: if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` is a non-empty list with the last element being `lit[i]`, and `x` is the last element of `a`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `b` is an empty list, `y` is infinity, and `a` is a non-empty list with the last element being `lit[i]`, and `x` is the last element of `a`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x`, `b` now contains the element `lit[i]`, and the new value of `y` is equal to `lit[i]`. In all cases, `x` is less than `y`. If `x` is not less than `y`, the original values of `x` and `y` are retained.***
