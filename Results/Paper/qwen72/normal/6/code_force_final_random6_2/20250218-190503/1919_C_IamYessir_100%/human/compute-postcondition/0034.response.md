Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list with the first element being `lit[0]`, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[0]`), `b` is either an empty list or a non-empty list, `y` is either infinity or the last element of `b`, `x` is less than `y`, and the current value of `x` is greater than or equal to the value of `lit[i]` (which is `lit[0]`).**
