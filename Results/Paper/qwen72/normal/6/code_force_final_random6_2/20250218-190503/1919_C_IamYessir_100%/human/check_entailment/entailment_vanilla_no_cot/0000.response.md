Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for splitting the array into two subsequences `a` and `b` is flawed and does not ensure that the penalty is minimized. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Logic for Splitting the Array**:
   - The program attempts to split the array into two subsequences based on the comparison of the last elements of `a` and `b` with the current element of the input array. However, this approach does not guarantee that the subsequences will have the minimum possible penalty.
   - The conditions for appending elements to `a` or `b` are overly complex and do not follow a clear strategy to minimize the penalty.

2. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The penalty is calculated by counting the number of indices where the current element is greater than the previous element in each subsequence. This part of the code is correct, but it relies on the incorrect splitting logic.

3. **Optimal Splitting Strategy**:
   - To minimize the penalty, the optimal strategy is to ensure that both subsequences `s` and `t` are as non-increasing as possible. This means that for each element in the input array, you should append it to the subsequence where it maintains or decreases the current value.
   - A simpler and more effective approach would be to always append the current element to the subsequence where it does not increase the penalty. If both subsequences are empty, you can append it to either one.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = []
        t = []
        
        for num in lit:
            if not s or num <= s[-1]:
                s.append(num)
            else:
                t.append(num)
        
        penalty_s = sum(1 for i in range(1, len(s)) if s[i] > s[i - 1])
        penalty_t = sum(1 for i in range(1, len(t)) if t[i] > t[i - 1])
        
        print(penalty_s + penalty_t)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize two empty lists `s` and `t` to store the subsequences.
   
2. **Splitting the Array**:
   - For each element in the input array `lit`, append it to `s` if `s` is empty or the current element is less than or equal to the last element of `s`.
   - Otherwise, append it to `t`.

3. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - Calculate the penalty for `s` by counting the number of indices where the current element is greater than the previous element.
   - Calculate the penalty for `t` similarly.
   - Print the sum of the penalties for `s` and `t`.

This approach ensures that the subsequences are as non-increasing as possible, thereby minimizing the penalty.
