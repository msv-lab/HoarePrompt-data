Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list that now includes `lit[i]` as its last element, `b` is a list, `s` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[i]`), `y` is positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`, and `x` is less than `y`. Additionally, the current value of `x` is greater than or equal to the value of `lit[i]`.**
