The code snippet updates the value of `count` by adding the value associated with `mod_x` in `mod_x_map` and the value associated with `mod_y` in `mod_y_map`. Since both `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are initially empty, the `get` method will return 0 for both `mod_x` and `mod_y`. Therefore, `count` will be incremented by 0 + 0, which means `count` remains 0.

Output State: **`test_cases` remains a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `count`, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the value of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the value of `num % y`.**
