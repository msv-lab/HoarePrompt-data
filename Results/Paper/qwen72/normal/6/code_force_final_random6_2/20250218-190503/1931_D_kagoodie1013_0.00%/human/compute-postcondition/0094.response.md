Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` where each element corresponds to the number of pairs `(i, j)` in the respective list `a` such that `a[i] % x == -a[j] % x` or `a[i] % y == a[j] % y`. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, and the `results` list contains as many elements as there are tuples in `test_cases`. Each element in `results` is the final value of `count` for the corresponding tuple, which is the sum of the counts of such pairs for each integer in the respective `a`. **
