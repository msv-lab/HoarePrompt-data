Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly count the number of beautiful pairs as defined in the problem description. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly counts pairs by using the modulo results of the array elements, which does not ensure that both conditions (sum and difference being divisible by x and y, respectively) are met simultaneously.

For example, consider the test case:
```
n = 6, x = 5, y = 2
arr = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]
```
The correct output should be 2, as the pairs (1, 5) and (4, 6) are the only beautiful pairs. However, the program's logic will count pairs based on the modulo results, which can lead to incorrect counts.

To fix this, the program should explicitly check each pair of indices (i, j) to see if both conditions are satisfied. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (arr[i] + arr[j]) % x == 0 and (arr[i] - arr[j]) % y == 0:
                    count += 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

This version of the function will correctly count the number of beautiful pairs by explicitly checking the sum and difference conditions for each pair of indices.
