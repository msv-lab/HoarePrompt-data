The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a`. Here, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The total sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list `results` that contains as many elements as there are tuples in `test_cases`. Each element in `results` is the final value of `count` for the corresponding tuple, where `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each `num` in the respective `arr`. The `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries for each tuple contain keys representing the unique remainders of `num % x` and `num % y` for each `num` in the respective `arr`, with values representing the count of times each remainder appears.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` where each element is the sum of counts of remainders when each integer in `a` is divided by `x` and `y`, for each tuple in `test_cases`.**
