Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `test_cases` remains a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each `num` in `arr`, `mod_x_map` contains keys representing the unique remainders of `num % x` for each `num` in `arr`, with values representing the count of times each remainder appears, `mod_y_map` contains keys representing the unique remainders of `num % y` for each `num` in `arr`, with values representing the count of times each remainder appears.**

In natural language:
- The `test_cases` list remains unchanged.
- The `results` list is still empty.
- The `count` variable now holds the total sum of the values from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for each element in `arr` as the loop iterated through them.
- The `mod_x_map` dictionary now contains keys for each unique remainder when the elements of `arr` are divided by `x`, and the values are the counts of how many times each remainder appeared.
- The `mod_y_map` dictionary now contains keys for each unique remainder when the elements of `arr` are divided by `y`, and the values are the counts of how many times each remainder appeared.
