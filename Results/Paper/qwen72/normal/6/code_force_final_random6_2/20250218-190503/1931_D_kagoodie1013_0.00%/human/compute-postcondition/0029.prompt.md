Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in arr:
    mod_x = -num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
    mod_x_key = num % x
    mod_y_key = num % y
    mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
    mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` now contains the key `mod_x_key` with a value of 1 (if it did not exist before) or the key `mod_x_key` with an incremented value by 1 (if it existed before), `mod_y_map` now contains the key `mod_y_key` with a value of 1 (if it did not exist before) or the key `mod_y_key` with an incremented value by 1 (if it existed before), `num` is the first element in `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the result of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is the result of `num % y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` now contains the key `mod_x_key` with a value of 1 (if it did not exist before) or the key `mod_x_key` with an incremented value by 1 (if it existed before), `mod_y_map` now contains the key `mod_y_key` with a value of 2 (if it existed before) or the key `mod_y_key` with a value of 1 (if it did not exist before), `num` is the second element in `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the result of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is the result of `num % y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` now contains the key `mod_x_key` with a value of 2 (if it existed before) or the key `mod_x_key` with a value of 1 (if it did not exist before), `mod_y_map` now contains the key `mod_y_key` with a value of 3 (if it existed before) or the key `mod_y_key` with a value of 1 (if it did not exist before), `num` is the third element in `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the result of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is the result of `num % y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
