Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` now contains the key `mod_x_key` with a value of 1 (if it did not exist before) or the key `mod_x_key` with an incremented value by 1 (if it existed before), `mod_y_map` now contains the key `mod_y_key` with a value of 1 (if it did not exist before) or the key `mod_y_key` with an incremented value by 1 (if it existed before), `num` is the second element in `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the result of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is the result of `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mod_x` is calculated as `-num % x`.
- All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
