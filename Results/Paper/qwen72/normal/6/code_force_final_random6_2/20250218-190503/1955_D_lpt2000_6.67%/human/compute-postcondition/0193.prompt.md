You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function definition. Based on the problem description, the function should take three parameters: `a` (a list of integers), `b` (a list of integers), and `k` (an integer). The parameters should satisfy the conditions: `1 <= k <= len(b) <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5`, and each element in `a` and `b` should be an integer in the range `1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6`. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, so it should also take an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) as the first parameter.
def func():
    nabors = int(input())
    for _ in range(nabors):
        n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
        
        cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
        
        D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
        
        E = cnt_aa - D
        
        C = cnt_bb - D
        
        tot = sum(D.values())
        
        fnd = 1 if tot >= k else 0
        
        for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
            if D[out_aa] > 0:
                if E[out_aa] > 0:
                    E[out_aa] -= 1
                else:
                    D[out_aa] -= 1
                    C[out_aa] += 1
            else:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            if C[in_aa] > 0:
                if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
                    C[in_aa] += 1
                else:
                    D[in_aa] += 1
            else:
                E[in_aa] += 1
            tot = sum(D.values())
            fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0
        
        print(fnd)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `nabors` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the final input integers provided by the user, `aa` is the final list of integers provided by the user, `bb` is the final list of integers provided by the user, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of the final `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in the final `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the minimum frequency of common elements between the final window of `m` elements in `aa` and all elements in `bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in the final window of `m` elements in `aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in the final `bb` that are not in `D`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is the total number of times `tot` was greater than or equal to `k` during all the loop's executions.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `a` (a list of integers), `b` (a list of integers), and `k` (an integer). It processes these parameters for each test case and returns a result.
