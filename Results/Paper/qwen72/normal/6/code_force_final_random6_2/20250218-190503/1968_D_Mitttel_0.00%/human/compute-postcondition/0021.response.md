Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `index` is increased by `2 * n + 4`, `p` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n - n]` to `data[index - n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index + n - n - 1]`, `results` now includes the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `PB` is updated to the integer value of `data[index + 2]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `PS`, `index`, `p`, `a`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state, except for the updated value of `PB`.
