To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `results` must contain at least one element.
  - `result` is the first element in `results`.

- **Loop statement:**
  ```python
  for result in results:
      # the loop body is omit
  ```

- **Analysis:**
  - The loop iterates over the elements in the `results` list.
  - At the end of the previous iteration, `result` was the first element in `results`.
  - For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `results` must be available.
  - Therefore, `results` must contain at least two elements for the loop to proceed to the next iteration.

- **Adjustments:**
  - `result` should now be the second element in `results`.
  - `results` must contain at least two elements.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`results` must contain at least two elements, `result` is the second element in `results`**
