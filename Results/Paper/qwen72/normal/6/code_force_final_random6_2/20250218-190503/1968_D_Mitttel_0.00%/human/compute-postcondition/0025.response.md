The code snippet:
```
index += n
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

**Impact of the code:**
- The value of `index` is incremented by `n`.

**Previous values of affected variables:**
- `index` was previously increased by `2 * n + 8`.

**Calculation of the result:**
- The new value of `index` is `index + n`.
- Since `index` was already increased by `2 * n + 8`, the new value of `index` becomes `2 * n + 8 + n`, which simplifies to `3 * n + 8`.

**Output State:**
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
- `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`.
- `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`.
- `index` is now `3 * n + 8`.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n - n - 4]` to `data[index - n - 1 - 4]`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n - 4]` to `data[index + n - n - 1 - 4]`.
- `p` is now a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`.
- `results` now includes the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.
