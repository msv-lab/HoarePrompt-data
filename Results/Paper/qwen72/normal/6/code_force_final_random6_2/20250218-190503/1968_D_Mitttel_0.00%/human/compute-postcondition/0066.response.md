Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop, `score` will be the sum of the elements in `a` that were accessed through the permutation `p` starting from `start_pos` for `k` steps or until a cycle is detected, `current_pos` will be the position in the permutation `p` after `steps` iterations, `steps` will be the number of iterations executed, `visited` will be a dictionary mapping each visited position to the step at which it was first visited, and `cycle_start` will be the step at which the cycle was first detected or -1 if no cycle was detected. If `cycle_start` is not -1, `score` is updated to include the element at `current_pos - 1` for each iteration, `current_pos` is now `p[current_pos - 1]` after all iterations, `steps` is now `k`, `visited` remains unchanged, `cycle_start` remains the step at which the cycle was first detected, `cycle_length` remains 0, `cycle_pos` remains the position in the permutation `p` after `cycle_length` iterations, `cycle_score` remains the sum of the elements in `a` that were accessed through the permutation `p` starting from the `cycle_start` position for the entire `cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is now 0, and `full_cycles` remains undefined or results in an error, `remainder_steps` is now 0. If `cycle_start` is -1, the program state remains unchanged.**
