Precondition: **No variables are passed in the function signature, but the function reads from standard input, expecting a formatted string of integers. The input data is split and processed to extract the number of test cases t, the length of the permutation n, the duration of the game k, Bodya's starting position PB, Sasha's starting position PS, the permutation p, and the array a. The values of n, k, PB, and PS are integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The permutation p is a list of integers of length n, where each element p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n. The array a is a list of integers of length n, where each element a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
