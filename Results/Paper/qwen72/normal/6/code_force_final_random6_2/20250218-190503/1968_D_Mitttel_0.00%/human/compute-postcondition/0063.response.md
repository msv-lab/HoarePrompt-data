Output State: **`score` is updated to `score + a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is now `p[current_pos - 1]`, `steps` will be the number of iterations executed, `visited` will be a dictionary mapping each visited position to the step at which it was first visited, `cycle_start` will be the step at which the cycle was first detected, `cycle_length` will be 0, `cycle_pos` will be the position in the permutation `p` after `cycle_length` iterations, `cycle_score` will be the sum of the elements in `a` that were accessed through the permutation `p` starting from the `cycle_start` position for the entire `cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is now `remaining_steps - 1`, `full_cycles` will be undefined or result in an error, `remainder_steps` is now `k - steps - 1`.** 

The value of `score` is incremented by the value at `a[current_pos - 1]`. The value of `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`. The value of `remaining_steps` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
