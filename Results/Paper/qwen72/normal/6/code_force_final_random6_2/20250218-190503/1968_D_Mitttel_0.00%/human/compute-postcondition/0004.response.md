Output State: **The function is now set up to read from standard input, expecting a formatted string of integers. No variables have been directly modified yet, but the function has read the input data and split it into a list called `data`. The conditions for these variables remain the same: 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and a is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9. `index` is now 2, and `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`.**
