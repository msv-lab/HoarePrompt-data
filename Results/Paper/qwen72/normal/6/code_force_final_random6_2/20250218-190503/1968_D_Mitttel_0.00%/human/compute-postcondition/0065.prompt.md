Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `score` is unchanged, `current_pos` will be the position in the permutation `p` after `steps` iterations, `steps` will be the number of iterations executed, `visited` will be a dictionary mapping each visited position to the step at which it was first visited, `cycle_start` will be the step at which the cycle was first detected, `cycle_length` will be 0, `cycle_pos` will be the position in the permutation `p` after `cycle_length` iterations, `cycle_score` will be the sum of the elements in `a` that were accessed through the permutation `p` starting from the `cycle_start` position for the entire `cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` will be `k - steps`, `full_cycles` will be undefined or result in an error, `remainder_steps` will be `k - steps`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(remainder_steps):
    score += a[current_pos - 1]
    current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `score` is updated to `score + a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is now `p[current_pos - 1]`, `steps` will be the number of iterations executed, `visited` will be a dictionary mapping each visited position to the step at which it was first visited, `cycle_start` will be the step at which the cycle was first detected, `cycle_length` will be 0, `cycle_pos` will be the position in the permutation `p` after `cycle_length` iterations, `cycle_score` will be the sum of the elements in `a` that were accessed through the permutation `p` starting from the `cycle_start` position for the entire `cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` must be greater than 0, `full_cycles` will be undefined or result in an error, `remainder_steps` will be `k - steps`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `score` is updated to `score + a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is now `p[current_pos - 1]`, `steps` will be the number of iterations executed, `visited` will be a dictionary mapping each visited position to the step at which it was first visited, `cycle_start` will be the step at which the cycle was first detected, `cycle_length` will be 0, `cycle_pos` will be the position in the permutation `p` after `cycle_length` iterations, `cycle_score` will be the sum of the elements in `a` that were accessed through the permutation `p` starting from the `cycle_start` position for the entire `cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is now `remaining_steps - 1`, `full_cycles` will be undefined or result in an error, `remainder_steps` will be `k - steps`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `score` is updated to `score + a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is now `p[current_pos - 1]`, `steps` will be the number of iterations executed, `visited` will be a dictionary mapping each visited position to the step at which it was first visited, `cycle_start` will be the step at which the cycle was first detected, `cycle_length` will be 0, `cycle_pos` will be the position in the permutation `p` after `cycle_length` iterations, `cycle_score` will be the sum of the elements in `a` that were accessed through the permutation `p` starting from the `cycle_start` position for the entire `cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is now `remaining_steps - 1`, `full_cycles` will be undefined or result in an error, `remainder_steps` is now `k - steps - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
