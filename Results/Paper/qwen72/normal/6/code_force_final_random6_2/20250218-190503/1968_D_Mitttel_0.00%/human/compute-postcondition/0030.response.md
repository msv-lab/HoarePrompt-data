The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` is 1. For the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `index` is now `3 * n + 8 + n`, `p` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `a` is now a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `results` now includes the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**
