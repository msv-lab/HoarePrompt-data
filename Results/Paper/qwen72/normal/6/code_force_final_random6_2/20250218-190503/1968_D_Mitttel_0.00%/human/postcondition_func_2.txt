The function `func_2` reads a formatted string of integers from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results of each test case. Each test case includes the length of a permutation `n`, the duration of a game `k`, Bodya's starting position `PB`, Sasha's starting position `PS`, a permutation `p`, and an array `a`. The function calls `func_1` for each test case with the extracted parameters and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list. The function does not return any value; its primary purpose is to output the results of the game logic for each test case.
