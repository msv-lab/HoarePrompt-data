You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the test cases, extracting the necessary values for each test case and calling `func_1` to determine the winner.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases and ensures that the input is processed correctly.

2. **Score Calculation (calculate_score):**
   - The function `calculate_score` calculates the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to keep track of the positions visited and the step at which they were visited. This helps in detecting cycles.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by:
     - Determining the cycle length and the score for one full cycle.
     - Adding the score for the full cycles and the remaining steps after the cycles.
   - If no cycle is detected, it simply continues to add the score for each step until `k` steps are reached.

3. **Game Logic (func_1):**
   - The function `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha to get their final scores.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Cycle Detection:**
  - The `calculate_score` function correctly detects cycles using the `visited` dictionary. When a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps efficiently by leveraging the cycle length and score.
  - This is crucial because the game can last up to \(10^9\) turns, and without cycle detection, the function would be too slow.

- **Score Calculation:**
  - The score is calculated correctly by adding the value of `a` at the current position for each step.
  - The function handles both the case where the player stays at the same position and the case where the player moves to the next position in the permutation.

- **Input and Output:**
  - The input handling in `func_2` is efficient and correctly processes the input for multiple test cases.
  - The output is generated correctly for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct and handles the problem as described. It efficiently detects cycles and calculates the scores for both players, ensuring that the game logic is followed accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
