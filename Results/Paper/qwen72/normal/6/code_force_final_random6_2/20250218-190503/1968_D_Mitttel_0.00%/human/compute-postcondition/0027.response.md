Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `index` is now `3 * n + 8 + n`, `p` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `a` is now a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `results` now includes the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by `n`, so the new value of `index` is `3 * n + 8 + n`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, and `results` remain unchanged.
- The lists `p` and `a` still contain the same `n` integers, but they now start from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]` due to the update of `index`.
- The value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` is still included in `results`.
