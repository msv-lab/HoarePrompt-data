Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for determining the winner of the game based on the scores calculated for Bodya and Sasha.
   - It calls `calculate_score` for both players' starting positions and compares the results.
   - The logic for comparing scores and returning the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It correctly handles the movement through the permutation `p` and the addition of scores from array `a`.
   - The function also correctly detects cycles in the permutation and calculates the score for the remaining steps after the cycle is detected.
   - The cycle detection and score calculation logic is sound and matches the requirements of the problem.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed after all test cases are processed.
   - The function handles the input and output format as specified in the problem description.

Overall, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" as described in the problem. Each function performs its intended task, and the flow of the program from input to output is consistent with the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
