The only object in the loop head is the variable `remainder_steps`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `remainder_steps`. If `remainder_steps` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `remaining_steps` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `remainder_steps` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`score` is updated to `score + a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is now `p[current_pos - 1]`, `steps` will be the number of iterations executed, `visited` will be a dictionary mapping each visited position to the step at which it was first visited, `cycle_start` will be the step at which the cycle was first detected, `cycle_length` will be 0, `cycle_pos` will be the position in the permutation `p` after `cycle_length` iterations, `cycle_score` will be the sum of the elements in `a` that were accessed through the permutation `p` starting from the `cycle_start` position for the entire `cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is now `remaining_steps - 1`, `full_cycles` will be undefined or result in an error, `remainder_steps` will be `k - steps`**
