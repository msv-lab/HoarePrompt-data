The function `func_1` takes in parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. It calculates the scores for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their respective positions `PB` and `PS` within the permutation `p` and the list `a`. The function returns 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is greater than Sasha's score, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is greater than Bodya's score, and 'Draw' if both scores are equal. The final state of the program is that it has returned one of these three strings, indicating the result of the score comparison.
