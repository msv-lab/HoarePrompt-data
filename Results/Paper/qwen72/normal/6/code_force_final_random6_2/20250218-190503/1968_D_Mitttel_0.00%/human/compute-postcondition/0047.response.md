The only objects in the loop head are the list `results` and the variable `result`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `results`. If `results` has at least three elements, the loop will execute one more time with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` must contain at least two elements, and `result` is the second element in `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least three elements, and `result` will be the third element in `results`.

State: **`results` must contain at least three elements, `result` is the third element in `results`**
