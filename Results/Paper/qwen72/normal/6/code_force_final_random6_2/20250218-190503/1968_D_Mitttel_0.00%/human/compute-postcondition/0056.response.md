To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `remainder_steps`. The loop will execute if `remainder_steps` is greater than 0. The other variables mentioned in the state before the loop starts do not directly affect the loop's execution condition, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`score` is unchanged, `current_pos` will be the position in the permutation `p` after `steps` iterations, `steps` will be the number of iterations executed, `visited` will be a dictionary mapping each visited position to the step at which it was first visited, `cycle_start` will be the step at which the cycle was first detected, `cycle_length` will be 0, `cycle_pos` will be the position in the permutation `p` after `cycle_length` iterations, `cycle_score` will be the sum of the elements in `a` that were accessed through the permutation `p` starting from the `cycle_start` position for the entire `cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` must be greater than 0, `full_cycles` will be undefined or result in an error, `remainder_steps` will be `k - steps`**
