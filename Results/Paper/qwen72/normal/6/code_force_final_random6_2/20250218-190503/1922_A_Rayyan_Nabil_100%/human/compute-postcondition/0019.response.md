Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended three times, `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to the list `results`.
- Initially, `results` contained the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended twice.
- After the code execution, `results` now contains the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended three times.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
- The value of `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.
- The initial conditions for `t` and the constraints on `_` remain valid.
