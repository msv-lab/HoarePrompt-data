The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, it is mentioned that there is an integer `t` such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. This implies that the function might internally use or generate this value `t` to determine the number of test cases to handle. The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It is designed to handle a number of test cases, `t`, where 1 <= t <= 1000, but the specific output or return value is not provided.**
