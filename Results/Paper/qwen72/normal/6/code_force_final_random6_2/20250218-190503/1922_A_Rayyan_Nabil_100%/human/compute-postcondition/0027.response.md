Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended `t` times and has been fully iterated, `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
- The list `results` has been fully iterated, meaning all `t` elements in the list have been printed.
- The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop.
