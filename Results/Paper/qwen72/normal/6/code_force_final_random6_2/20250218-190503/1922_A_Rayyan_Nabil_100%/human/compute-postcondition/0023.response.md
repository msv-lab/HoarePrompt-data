The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `results`. If `results` has more than one element, the loop will execute again for the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `results` must have at least 1 element, and `result` is the first element in the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least 2 elements, and `result` will be the second element in the `results` list.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended `t` times and must have at least 2 elements, `result` is the second element in the `results` list, `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed**
