Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed.**

The code `a = input().strip()` updates the value of `a` to a new string input by the user, with any leading and trailing whitespace removed. The other variables remain unchanged.
