The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from user input, where 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three additional inputs: an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b`, all with leading and trailing whitespace removed. It then calls `func_1` with these inputs and appends the result to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list. The final state of the program is that `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` for each test case, and the list has been fully iterated and printed.
