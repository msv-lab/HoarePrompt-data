The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns 'YES' if, for any index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
