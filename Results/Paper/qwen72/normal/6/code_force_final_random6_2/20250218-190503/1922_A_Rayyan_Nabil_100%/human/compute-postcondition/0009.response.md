Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed.**

The value of `n` is updated to a new integer input by the user, which is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. The other variables (`t`, `results`, `a`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged.
