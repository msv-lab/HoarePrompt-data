### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not.
   - A template `t` is a string of length `n` where each character can be either lowercase or uppercase.
   - For a string `s` to match the template `t`:
     - If `t[i]` is lowercase, `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
     - If `t[i]` is uppercase, `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` is designed to check if such a template exists for a single test case.
   - It iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for any position `i`, it returns 'YES'.
   - If no such position is found, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2()` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each test case and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

4. **Correctness of Function 1:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct. If for any position `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, we can construct a template `t` where `t[i]` is an uppercase letter corresponding to `a[i]` or `b[i]` (or any other uppercase letter that is not the same as `c[i]`).
   - However, the function does not explicitly check if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, which is a necessary condition for them to match the template. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, we cannot construct a template that matches both `a` and `b` but not `c` unless `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.

5. **Correctness of Function 2:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results.
   - It prints the results in the correct order.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:

- The original assessment correctly identifies the logic in `func_1` for checking if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
- However, it overlooks the fact that `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be the same for the template to be valid. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template cannot be constructed to match both `a` and `b` while ensuring `c` does not match.

### Corrected Function 1:

To ensure the template can be constructed, we need to check if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from `c[i]`.

```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```

### Final Evaluation:

- The original function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not account for the condition that `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be the same to construct a valid template.
- The corrected function `func_1` should be used to ensure the program is correct.

Final: **False**
