Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \).
   - He can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - The goal is to determine if he can form a new rectangle from the two resulting rectangles that is different from the original rectangle (considering rotations as the same).

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( a \) and \( b \).
   - It then calls the function `func_1(a, b)` and prints the result.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` returns 'yes' if \( b \) is even, and 'no' otherwise.

3. **Evaluating the Logic**:
   - If \( b \) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \).
   - These two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size \( 2a \times \frac{b}{2} \).
   - The new rectangle \( 2a \times \frac{b}{2} \) is different from the original \( a \times b \) unless \( 2a = b \) or \( \frac{b}{2} = a \).

4. **Checking the Conditions**:
   - The program only checks if \( b \) is even.
   - However, it should also check if \( 2a = b \) or \( \frac{b}{2} = a \) to ensure the new rectangle is different from the original.
   - If \( b \) is even and \( 2a = b \) or \( \frac{b}{2} = a \), the new rectangle will be the same as the original, and the program should return 'no'.

5. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the test case \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 4 \):
     - The program will return 'yes' because \( b \) is even.
     - However, cutting the \( 2 \times 4 \) rectangle into two \( 2 \times 2 \) rectangles and rearranging them will result in a \( 4 \times 2 \) rectangle, which is the same as the original \( 2 \times 4 \) rectangle (considering rotations).
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect for this test case.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly handle all cases where \( b \) is even but the resulting new rectangle is the same as the original rectangle when considering rotations.
   - The function `func_1` needs to include additional checks to ensure the new rectangle is different from the original.

Final: **False**
