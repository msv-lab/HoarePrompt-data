Reasoning:  
The provided program checks if the side `b` of the rectangle is even and returns "yes" if it is, and "no" if it is not. However, this logic is incomplete and incorrect for the problem's requirements. The problem states that Bob can cut the rectangle parallel to one of its sides, and the goal is to determine if he can form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering that rectangles are the same if they differ only by a 90-degree rotation.

To form a new rectangle, Bob can:
1. Cut the rectangle along the side `a` into two rectangles of size `a/2 \times b` (if `a` is even).
2. Cut the rectangle along the side `b` into two rectangles of size `a \times b/2` (if `b` is even).

After cutting, Bob can form a new rectangle by combining the two resulting rectangles. The new rectangle will have dimensions `a \times (b/2 + b/2)` or `(a/2 + a/2) \times b`, which simplifies to the original dimensions. However, if Bob cuts the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then combines them in a different orientation, he can form a new rectangle with dimensions `(a/2) \times (2b)` or `(2a) \times (b/2)`.

For example:
- For a 2 \times 6 rectangle, Bob can cut it into two 2 \times 3 rectangles and then form a 4 \times 3 rectangle.
- For a 3 \times 2 rectangle, Bob can cut it into two 3 \times 1 rectangles and then form a 1 \times 6 rectangle.

The program should check if either `a` or `b` is even, because if either side is even, Bob can cut the rectangle and form a new one. The current program only checks if `b` is even, which is insufficient.

Therefore, the correct logic should be to return "yes" if either `a` or `b` is even, and "no" otherwise.

Correctness: **False**
