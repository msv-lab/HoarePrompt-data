Reasoning: The original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` only checks if the dimension `b` is even, which is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle. The problem requires checking if either dimension `a` or `b` can be cut in such a way that the resulting pieces can form a new rectangle that is different from the original. Specifically, if either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle and rearrange the pieces to form a different rectangle. However, the function only considers `b` and ignores `a`, leading to incorrect results for cases where `a` is even and `b` is odd, or vice versa.

For example:
- For the input \(a = 1\) and \(b = 4\), the program will output "No" because it only checks if `b` is even, but the correct output should be "Yes" because the rectangle can be cut into two \(1 \times 2\) rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a \(2 \times 2\) rectangle.
- For the input \(a = 4\) and \(b = 1\), the program will output "No" because `b` is odd, but the correct output should be "Yes" because the rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 1\) rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a \(2 \times 2\) rectangle.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should check if either `a` or `b` is even. If at least one of them is even, Bob can form a different rectangle; otherwise, he cannot.

Final: **False**
