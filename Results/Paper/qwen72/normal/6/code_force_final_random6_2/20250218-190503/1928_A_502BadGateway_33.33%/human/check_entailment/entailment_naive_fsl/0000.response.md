Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. The function `func_1` only checks if \(b\) is even, which is insufficient to solve the problem as described.

For example, consider the input \(a = 1\) and \(b = 4\). According to the problem description, a \(1 \times 4\) rectangle can be cut into two \(1 \times 2\) rectangles, and these can be used to form a \(2 \times 2\) rectangle, which is different from the original \(1 \times 4\) rectangle. Therefore, the correct output should be "Yes". However, the program will output "No" because it only checks if \(b\) is even and does not consider the possibility of cutting the rectangle along the \(a\) dimension.

Another example is \(a = 4\) and \(b = 1\). The program will output "No" because \(b\) is not even, but the correct output should be "Yes" because the rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 1\) rectangles, which can then be used to form a \(2 \times 2\) rectangle.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
