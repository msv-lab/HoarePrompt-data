Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect. The function `func_1` only checks if the side `b` of the rectangle is even, and it does not consider the side `a` at all. However, based on the problem description, Bob can form a different rectangle if either `a` or `b` is even, because an even side can be divided into two equal parts, and these parts can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. The program should check if either `a` or `b` is even, not just `b`.

For example:
- For the input `2 1`, the program outputs "no" because `b` is odd, but it should output "no" because neither `a` nor `b` is even.
- For the input `3 2`, the program outputs "yes" because `b` is even, which is correct.
- For the input `2 2`, the program outputs "yes" because `b` is even, which is correct.
- For the input `6 3`, the program outputs "no" because `b` is odd, but it should output "yes" because `a` is even.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not fully address the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
