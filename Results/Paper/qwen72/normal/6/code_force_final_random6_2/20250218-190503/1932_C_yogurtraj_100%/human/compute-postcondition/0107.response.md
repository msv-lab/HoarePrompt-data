Postcondition: **`t` is the input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the input string `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `k` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `n - 2`, the last character of `t` is 'L' if it was, and `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l + 1`, and `k` is `a[l] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L'. Additionally, `t[i]` is not 'R'.**
