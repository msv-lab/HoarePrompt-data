Output State: **`pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), `a` is a list of n integers, `b` is a list of n integers, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is `min(a[i], b[i]) + 2 * min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` is `n - 3`. If `i` < `m`, `pergunta` is updated to the minimum of the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`.**

Explanation:
- `x` is updated to `x + min(a[i], b[i])`. Since `x` was initially `min(a[i], b[i]) + min(a[i], b[i])`, the new value of `x` is `min(a[i], b[i]) + 2 * min(a[i], b[i])`.
- The value of `i` remains `n - 3`.
- The value of `pergunta` is updated only if `i` < `m`. If this condition is true, `pergunta` is updated to the minimum of the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
