To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
```

This loop iterates over the range from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the following conditions must be met:

1. `n` must be at least 1, because if `n` is 0, the range `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` would be `range(-1, -1, -1)`, which is an empty range and the loop would not execute.
2. `i` should start at `n - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4)
- `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represents the cost to bribe the i-th person
- `b` is a list of n integers where each `b_i` (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) represents the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i-1 when Kirill moves to position j
- `n` is an integer representing the number of people in the queue (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000)
- `m` is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n)
- `x` is 0

The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 and `i` starts at `n - 1`.

State: **`pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), `a` is a list of n integers where each a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represents the cost to bribe the i-th person, `b` is a list of n integers where each b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) represents the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i-1 when Kirill moves to position j, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`**
