Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum cost required to bribe Kirill to a position less than `m`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `n` is the same, `m` is the same, and `x` is the total minimum cost of bribes for all positions from `n-1` to `0`.**

### Explanation:
- **`pergunta`**: After the loop completes, `pergunta` will hold the minimum cost required to bribe Kirill to a position less than `m`. This is because for each position `i` that is less than `m`, the loop updates `pergunta` to the minimum of its current value and the cost of bribing up to that position (`x + a[i]`).
- **`a` and `b`**: These lists remain unchanged as they are only read within the loop and not modified.
- **`n`**: The number of people in the queue remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`m`**: The maximum allowable final position of Kirill remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`x`**: After the loop completes, `x` will be the total minimum cost of bribes for all positions from `n-1` to `0`. This is because `x` is incremented by the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each iteration of the loop.
