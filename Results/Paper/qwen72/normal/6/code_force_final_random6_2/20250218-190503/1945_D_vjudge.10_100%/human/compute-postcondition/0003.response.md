Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its initial value and `a[i]`, `a` is a list of n integers, `b` is a list of n integers, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `i` is less than `m`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pergunta` is updated to the minimum of its initial value and `a[i]`.
- The initial value of `x` is 0.
- The value of `i` is `n - 1`.
- The condition `i` is less than `m` remains valid.
- The lists `a` and `b` and the integer `m` remain unchanged.
