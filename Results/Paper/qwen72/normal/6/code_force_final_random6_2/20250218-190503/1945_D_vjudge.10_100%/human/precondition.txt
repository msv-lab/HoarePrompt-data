pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 <= pergunta <= 10^4), a and b are lists of integers where a contains the values a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) and b contains the values b_i (1 <= b_i <= 10^9), n is an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill (1 <= n <= 200,000), and m is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 <= m <= n). The lengths of a and b are equal to n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
