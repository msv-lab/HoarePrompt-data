Output State: **`i` is 1, `N` is greater than 1, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is set to 2. If `t` is at least 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `t` remains 1 and the program continues without breaking.** 

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in. The values of `i`, `N`, and `cnt[a[j]]` remain unchanged. The conditions for `t` are not affected by the `break` statement, so the state of `t` remains as it was before the `break` statement was executed.
