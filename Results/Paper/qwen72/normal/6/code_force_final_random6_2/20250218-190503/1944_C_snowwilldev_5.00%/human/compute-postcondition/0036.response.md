Output State: **`i` is `N-1`, `N` is an input integer, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`, `t` is the number of indices `i` for which `cnt[i] == 1` up to the point where `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, `tc` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is now a defaultdict with default integer values (0).**

Explanation:
- The `cnt` variable is now a `defaultdict` with a default value of 0 for any key that is not explicitly set.
- The initial state values for `i`, `N`, `cnt[a[j]]`, `t`, `tc`, and `a` remain unchanged, but `cnt` is now initialized as a `defaultdict(int)`.
