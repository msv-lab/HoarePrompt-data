Output State: **`N` is the value of `int(input())`, `i` is `N-1`, `cnt` is a defaultdict initialized with int, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `tc` must be less than the value returned by `int(input())`, `a` is a list of integers.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `N-1`, which is the last index of the list `a`. The `cnt` dictionary will have counted the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`, with `cnt[a[j]]` being incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `N-1`. The variable `tc` will have been incremented by 1, and it must still be less than the value returned by `int(input())`. The list `a` and the value of `N` remain unchanged.
