Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the game's optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Specifically, the program does not consider the optimal moves for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize it. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation:**
In this case, the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob would be:
1. Alice picks 0. Now, `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `c = [0]`.
2. Bob picks 1. Now, `a = [2, 3]` and `c = [0]`.
3. Alice picks 2. Now, `a = [3]` and `c = [0, 2]`.
4. Bob picks 3. Now, `a = []` and `c = [0, 2]`.

The MEX of `c = [0, 2]` is 1, which is the expected output. However, the program outputs 0, which is incorrect.

The program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the game's optimal strategy. It simply counts the number of unique elements and prints the first index where the count is less than 2, which does not align with the game's rules and objectives.
