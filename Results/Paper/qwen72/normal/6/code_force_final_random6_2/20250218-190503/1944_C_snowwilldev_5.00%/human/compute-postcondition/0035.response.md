Output State: **`i` is `N-1`, `N` is an input integer, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`, `t` is the number of indices `i` for which `cnt[i] == 1` up to the point where `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, `tc` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `a`. The other variables (`i`, `N`, `cnt`, `t`, and `tc`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial states.
