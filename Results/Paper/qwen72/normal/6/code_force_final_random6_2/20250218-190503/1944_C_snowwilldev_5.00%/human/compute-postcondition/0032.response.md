Output State: **`i` is `N-1`, `N` remains the same, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`, `t` is the number of indices `i` for which `cnt[i] == 1` up to the point where `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all iterations, so `i` is now `N-1`.
- The value of `N` remains unchanged.
- The `cnt` array has been incremented by 1 for each element `a[j]` where `j` ranges from 0 to `N-1`.
- The variable `t` counts the number of indices `i` for which `cnt[i] == 1`, but the loop will break as soon as `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0. Therefore, `t` will be the number of such indices up to the point where the loop breaks. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `t` will be the total count of indices where `cnt[i] == 1`.
