The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `N` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1, and `N` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 1, `N` must be greater than 1, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1.**
