The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so the element `a[0]` is incremented in the dictionary `cnt`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `cnt` is a defaultdict initialized with int, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `tc` is incremented by 1, `tc` must be less than the value returned by `int(input())`, `a` is a list of integers.**
