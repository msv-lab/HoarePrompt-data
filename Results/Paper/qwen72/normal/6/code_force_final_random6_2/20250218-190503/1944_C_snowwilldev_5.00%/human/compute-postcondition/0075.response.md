Output State: **`N` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cnt` is a defaultdict initialized with int, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[a[2]]` is incremented by 1, `tc` is incremented by 1, `tc` must be less than the value returned by `int(input())`, `a` is a list of integers.**

The value of `cnt[a[2]]` is incremented by 1, while the other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
