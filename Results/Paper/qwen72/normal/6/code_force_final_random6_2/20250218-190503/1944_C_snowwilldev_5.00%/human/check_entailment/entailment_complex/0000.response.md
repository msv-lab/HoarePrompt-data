### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game where they take turns picking elements from an array `a` and Alice appends her chosen element to a new array `c`.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` after the game ends, with Alice trying to maximize it and Bob trying to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a` itself.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the range from 0 to `N-1` and checks the count of each integer `i` in the array `a`.
   - If the count of `i` is 1 and `t` (which tracks the number of times a count of 1 has been encountered) is less than 2, it increments `t`.
   - If `t` becomes 2 or the count of `i` is 0, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice and Bob will play optimally. Alice will always try to pick elements that are not already in `c` to maximize the MEX, while Bob will try to pick elements that are already in `c` or that would prevent Alice from picking a higher MEX.
   - The key insight is that if an element appears exactly once in `a`, Alice will pick it, and if it appears more than once, Bob will pick it to minimize the MEX.
   - The function correctly identifies the first integer `i` that either does not appear in `a` or appears exactly once, which is the MEX of `c` after the game ends.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where the array `a` is empty or contains only one element correctly.
   - It also handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same, ensuring that the MEX is printed correctly.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The function prints the MEX for each test case, which is the expected output format.
   - The loop ensures that the MEX is found and printed as soon as possible, which aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
