Output State: **`i` is `N-1`, `N` remains the same, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The loop variable `i` will have the value `N-1`, which is the last index it reaches in the loop.
- The value of `N` remains unchanged, as it is the total number of iterations the loop is set to perform.
- The `cnt` dictionary will have incremented the count for each element `a[j]` in the list `a` by 1, for every index `j` from 0 to `N-1`. This means that each element in the list `a` up to the `N`-th element has been counted once.
