Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1. This information is not directly relevant to the print statement.
   - `h` and `m` are integers representing the hour and minute from the input string in the format 'HH:MM'.
   - If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` > 12, `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` is 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is 'AM'.
   - Otherwise, `h` remains the same and `day` is 'PM'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `h` and `m` are integers derived from the input string 'HH:MM'.
   - The value of `day` is determined based on the conditions given for `h`.

4. **Conditions for `day`:**
   - If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` > 12, `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` is 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is 'AM'.
   - Otherwise, `h` remains the same and `day` is 'PM'.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will format `h` and `m` to ensure they are two digits (e.g., 05 for 5).
   - The value of `day` will be either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
- The hour `h` formatted to two digits.
- The minute `m` formatted to two digits.
- The value of `day` which is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions for `h`.

Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day} (where {h:02d} is the hour in two-digit format, {m:02d} is the minute in two-digit format, and {day} is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions for `h`)**

For example, if the input string is '13:45':
- `h` would be 13, which is greater than 12, so `h` is updated to 13 - 12 = 1, and `day` is 'PM'.
- The output would be: **01:45 PM**.

If the input string is '00:30':
- `h` would be 0, so `h` is set to 12, and `day` is 'AM'.
- The output would be: **12:30 AM**.

If the input string is '12:15':
- `h` is 12, so `day` is 'AM'.
- The output would be: **12:15 AM**.

If the input string is '07:00':
- `h` is 7, which is less than 12, so `h` remains 7 and `day` is 'PM'.
- The output would be: **07:00 PM**.
