Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. This is correctly handled by `n = int(input())`.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `n` times, correctly processing each test case.

3. **Time Parsing**: Inside the loop, the program reads a string representing the time in 24-hour format and splits it into hours `h` and minutes `m` using `input().split(':')` and `map(int, ...)`. This is correct and ensures that `h` and `m` are integers.

4. **Time Conversion**:
   - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'. This is correct because 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'. This is correct for converting hours from 13 to 23 to their 12-hour format equivalents.
   - If `h` is 12, it sets `day` to 'PM'. This is correct because 12:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 PM in 12-hour format.
   - If `h` is between 1 and 11, it sets `day` to 'AM'. This is correct because these hours are already in the correct 12-hour format for AM.

5. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the time in the required format using `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}'`. This ensures that the hours and minutes are always two digits and are followed by the appropriate AM/PM indicator.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the hour is 00 (midnight), converting it to 12:00 AM.
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the hour is 12 (noon), keeping it as 12:00 PM.
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the hour is 23, converting it to 11:00 PM.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The `else` block is incorrectly placed and will always set `day` to 'PM' if `h` is not 0 or greater than 12. This means that for hours 1 to 11, the program will incorrectly set `day` to 'PM' instead of 'AM'.

To fix this, the `else` block should only handle the case where `h` is 12, and the case where `h` is between 1 and 11 should be handled separately.

Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        day = 'AM'
        if h >= 12:
            day = 'PM'
            if h > 12:
                h -= 12
        elif h == 0:
            h = 12
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

Given the original program, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
