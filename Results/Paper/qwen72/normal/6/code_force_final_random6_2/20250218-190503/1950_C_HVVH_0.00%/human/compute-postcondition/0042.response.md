Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1. This information is not directly relevant to the print statement, so we can ignore it for now.
   - `h` and `m` are integers representing the hour and minute from the input string in the format 'HH:MM'.
   - If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` > 12, `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` is 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is 'AM'.
   - Otherwise, `h` remains the same and `day` is 'PM'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The `print` statement will format `h` and `m` as two-digit numbers using `:02d`.
   - The value of `day` will be either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions described.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` is 'PM'.
   - If `h` is any other value between 1 and 11, `h` remains the same and `day` is 'PM'.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be in the format `HH:MM` followed by either 'AM' or 'PM'.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the print statement will output the hour and minute in a 12-hour format with the appropriate 'AM' or 'PM' designation.

Output: **`HH:MM` [day] (where `HH` is the formatted hour, `MM` is the formatted minute, and `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions described)**
