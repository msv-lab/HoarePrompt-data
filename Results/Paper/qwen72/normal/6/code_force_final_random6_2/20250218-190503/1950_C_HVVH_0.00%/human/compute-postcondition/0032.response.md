Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `h` and `m` are integers representing the hour and minute from the input string in the format 'HH:MM'. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` > 12, `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h` remains the same and `day` is 'PM'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))` reads an input string in the format 'HH:MM', splits it by the colon, and converts the hour and minute parts to integers. The values of `h` and `m` are now updated to these integers. The state of `n` and the conditions for setting `day` remain unchanged.
