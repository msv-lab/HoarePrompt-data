Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the number of `-` characters in the string `s` and then prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`. However, this approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the penalty.

### Why It's Incorrect:
1. **Optimal Splitting**: The program does not attempt to split the array `a` into subarrays in a way that minimizes the penalty. The optimal splitting strategy involves balancing the sums of the subarrays to minimize the total penalty, which is not addressed by the program.
2. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length. The program does not perform this calculation at all.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the string `s` is balanced (i.e., the number of `+` and `-` characters are equal).

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
1. Convert the string `s` into the array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
2. Find the optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
3. The optimal way to split the array is to ensure that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible. This can be achieved by splitting the array at points where the cumulative sum changes sign or is zero.

### Example Correct Solution:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    a = [1 if char == '+' else -1 for char in s]
    
    # Calculate the cumulative sum
    cumulative_sum = 0
    min_penalty = 0
    for i in range(n):
        cumulative_sum += a[i]
        min_penalty += abs(cumulative_sum)
    
    print(min_penalty)
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
- **Cumulative Sum**: The cumulative sum is calculated as we iterate through the array `a`. This helps us determine the sum of each subarray.
- **Min Penalty Calculation**: The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. By summing the absolute values of the cumulative sums, we effectively calculate the minimum possible penalty.

This approach ensures that the penalty is minimized by considering the optimal way to split the array.
