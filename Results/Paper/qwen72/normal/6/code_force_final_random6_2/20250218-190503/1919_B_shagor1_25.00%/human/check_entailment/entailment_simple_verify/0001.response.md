### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to split a string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty for each test case.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the number of `-` characters in the string `s` and stores it in `neg`.
   - The program calculates the penalty using the formula `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

3. **Evaluating the Formula:**
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is derived from the observation that:
     - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, then there are more `+` characters than `-` characters or vice versa.
     - The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to split the array such that each subarray has a sum of zero, if possible.
     - If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means the string consists entirely of `-` characters, and the penalty is simply the length of the array `n` because each subarray will have a sum of `-1` and a penalty of `1`.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic of counting `-` characters and using the formula `n - 2 * neg` is correct for the given problem.
   - However, the special case where `n` is equal to `neg` is not the only case that needs special handling. The formula `n - 2 * neg` does not always yield the correct result when the number of `+` and `-` characters is not equal.

5. **Testing the Program:**
   - For the test case `s = '+'` (n = 1, neg = 0):
     - `n - 2 * neg = 1 - 2 * 0 = 1` (Correct)
   - For the test case `s = '-----'` (n = 5, neg = 5):
     - `n - 2 * neg = 5 - 2 * 5 = 5` (Correct)
   - For the test case `s = '+-+-+-'` (n = 6, neg = 3):
     - `n - 2 * neg = 6 - 2 * 3 = 0` (Correct)
   - For the test case `s = '--+++++++-'` (n = 10, neg = 2):
     - `n - 2 * neg = 10 - 2 * 2 = 6` (Incorrect, should be 4)
   - For the test case `s = '+---++++-+++++---++-'` (n = 20, neg = 10):
     - `n - 2 * neg = 20 - 2 * 10 = 0` (Incorrect, should be 4)

6. **Correct Formula:**
   - The correct formula to minimize the penalty should be `n - 2 * min(neg, n - neg)`.
   - This formula accounts for the minimum number of `+` or `-` characters, ensuring that the penalty is minimized by balancing the subarrays as much as possible.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle the cases where the string has an equal number of `+` and `-` characters correctly. The provided formula `n - 2 * neg` is not sufficient for all cases, and the correct formula should be `n - 2 * min(neg, n - neg)`.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
