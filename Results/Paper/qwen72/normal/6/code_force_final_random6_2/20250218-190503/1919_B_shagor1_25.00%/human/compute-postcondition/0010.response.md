The only objects in the loop head are the string `s` and the variable `i`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `s` must be considered.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string with at least two characters.
- `i` is the second character of `s`.
- `func_1(s, n)` is defined with parameters `s` and `n` where `1 <= n <= 5000`.
- If `i` is '-', `neg` is 1 or 2 depending on whether the first character of `s` was '-' or not. Otherwise, `neg` remains 0 or 1 depending on whether the first character of `s` was '-' or not.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `s` will be assigned to `i`. Since `i` was the second character in the previous iteration, in the next iteration, `i` will be the third character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a string with at least three characters, `i` is the third character of `s`, and `func_1(s, n)` is defined with parameters `s` and `n` where `1 <= n <= 5000`. If `i` is '-', `neg` is 1 or 2 depending on whether the first character of `s` was '-' or not. Otherwise, `neg` remains 0 or 1 depending on whether the first character of `s` was '-' or not.**
