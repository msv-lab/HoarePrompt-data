Output State: **`s` is a string with any number of characters, `neg` is the count of '-' characters in the string `s`, and `func_1(s, n)` is defined with parameters `s` and `n` where `1 <= n <= 5000`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `neg` will contain the total number of times the character '-' appears in the string `s`. The string `s` and the parameter `n` remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop.
