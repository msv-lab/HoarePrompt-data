The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`. For the loop to execute, the string `s` must contain at least one character. The variable `i` will take on the value of each character in the string `s` during each iteration of the loop. The state of `neg` and the function definition `func_1(s, n)` do not affect the loop's execution and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` must be a string with at least one character, `i` is the first character of `s`, `neg` is 0, `func_1(s, n)` is defined with parameters `s` and `n` where `1 <= n <= 5000`**
