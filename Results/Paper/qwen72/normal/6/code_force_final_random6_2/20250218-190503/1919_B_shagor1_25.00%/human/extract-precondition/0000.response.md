Precondition: **The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(s, n):` where `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-", and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000.** 

However, based on the provided function definition `def func_1():`, it seems there is a mismatch. The function should be defined to accept the string `s` and the integer `n` as inputs. Here is the corrected precondition:

Precondition: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-", and n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000.**
