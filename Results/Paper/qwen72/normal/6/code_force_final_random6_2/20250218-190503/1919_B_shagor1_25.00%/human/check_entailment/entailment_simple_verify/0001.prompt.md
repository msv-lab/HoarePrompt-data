You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(s, n):` where `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-", and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000.

    #State: `s` is a string with any number of characters, `neg` is the count of '-' characters in the string `s`, and `func_1(s, n)` is defined with parameters `s` and `n` where `1 <= n <= 5000`.
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
    #This is printed: - Since the exact values of `n` and `neg` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the given conditions.
    #   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the output will be `n - 2 * neg`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - Each character in the string corresponds to an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
   - The goal is to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It then counts the number of `-` characters in the string `s` and stores it in `neg`.
   - The program calculates the penalty using the formula `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

3. **Evaluating the Formula:**
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is derived from the observation that:
     - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, then there are more `+` characters than `-` characters or vice versa.
     - The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to split the array such that each subarray has a sum of zero, if possible.
     - If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means the string consists entirely of `-` characters, and the penalty is simply the length of the array `n` because each subarray will have a sum of `-1` and a penalty of `1`.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic of counting `-` characters and using the formula `n - 2 * neg` is correct for the given problem.
   - The special case where `n` is equal to `neg` is also correctly handled by printing `n`.

5. **Testing the Program:**
   - For the test case `s = '+'` (n = 1, neg = 0):
     - `n - 2 * neg = 1 - 2 * 0 = 1` (Correct)
   - For the test case `s = '-----'` (n = 5, neg = 5):
     - `n - 2 * neg = 5 - 2 * 5 = 5` (Correct)
   - For the test case `s = '+-+-+-'` (n = 6, neg = 3):
     - `n - 2 * neg = 6 - 2 * 3 = 0` (Correct)
   - For the test case `s = '--+++++++-'` (n = 10, neg = 2):
     - `n - 2 * neg = 10 - 2 * 2 = 6` (Incorrect, should be 4)
   - For the test case `s = '+---++++-+++++---++-'` (n = 20, neg = 10):
     - `n - 2 * neg = 20 - 2 * 10 = 0` (Incorrect, should be 4)

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the cases where the string has an equal number of `+` and `-` characters correctly. The correct formula should be `n - 2 * min(neg, n - neg)` to account for the minimum number of `+` or `-` characters.

### Correctness:
**False**
