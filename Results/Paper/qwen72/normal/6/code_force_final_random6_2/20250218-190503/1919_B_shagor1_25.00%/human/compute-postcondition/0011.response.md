Output State: **`s` is a string with at least three characters, `i` is the third character of `s`, `neg` is increased by 1, `func_1(s, n)` is defined with parameters `s` and `n` where `1 <= n <= 5000`.** 

The value of `neg` is incremented by 1. If `i` was '-', `neg` was initially 1 or 2 depending on whether the first character of `s` was '-' or not, and now `neg` is 2 or 3. If `i` was not '-', `neg` was initially 0 or 1 depending on whether the first character of `s` was '-' or not, and now `neg` is 1 or 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
