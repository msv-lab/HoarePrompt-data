Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. However, the function `func_1` is called without any arguments, which is incorrect because it needs to process the string `s` and its length `n`.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` should be defined with parameters `s` and `n` to match the problem description. The current definition of `func_1` without parameters is a mistake.

3. **Penalty Calculation**: The program calculates the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and uses this to determine the penalty. However, the logic for calculating the penalty is flawed. The penalty should be minimized by splitting the array `a` into subarrays in such a way that the sum of the penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The current logic does not consider the optimal splitting of the array.

4. **Optimal Splitting**: The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to split the array `a` such that each subarray has a sum of zero. If it is not possible to have all subarrays with a sum of zero, the penalty should be calculated based on the remaining subarrays. The current logic does not achieve this.

5. **Output**: The output logic is incorrect. It prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, and `n` otherwise. This does not correctly reflect the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not follow the optimal splitting strategy and does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty.

Correctness: **False**
