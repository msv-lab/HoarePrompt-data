Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the string `s` consists of an equal number of `+` and `-` characters, but they are not alternating in a way that allows the penalty to be minimized to 0. For example, consider the input `s = "++--"`. The optimal way to split this string to minimize the penalty is `(["++", "--"])`, which would result in a penalty of `2 * 2 + 2 * 2 = 8`. However, the program will output `0` because it incorrectly assumes that if the number of `+` and `-` characters are equal, the penalty can always be minimized to 0.

This assumption is incorrect because the order of the characters matters. The program does not take into account the order of the characters when calculating the penalty, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
