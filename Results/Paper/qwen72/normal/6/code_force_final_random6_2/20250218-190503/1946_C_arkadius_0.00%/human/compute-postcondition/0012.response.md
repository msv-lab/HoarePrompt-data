Output State: **`n` is the same as in the initial state, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer read from the input, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` as its argument, and `n - 1` edges have been added to the `tree` instance, each connecting nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` where `u` and `v` are integers read from the input during each iteration. The `tree` instance has been rooted at node 0 with parent -1.**

Explanation: The method `root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` is called on the `tree` instance, which roots the tree at node 0 and sets its parent to -1. This method does not change the values of `n`, `i`, or `k`, nor does it affect the edges that have already been added to the `tree` instance. Therefore, the initial state remains valid with the additional information that the tree has been rooted at node 0.
