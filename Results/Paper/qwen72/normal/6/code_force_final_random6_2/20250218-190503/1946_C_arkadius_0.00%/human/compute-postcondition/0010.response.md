Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `k` is an integer read from the input, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` as its argument, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, and an edge has been added between `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the `tree` instance.**

The code `tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)` adds an edge between the nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the `tree` instance. Since the initial state already indicates that an edge has been added between these nodes, the output state remains unchanged. All other variables and conditions specified in the initial state are still valid.
