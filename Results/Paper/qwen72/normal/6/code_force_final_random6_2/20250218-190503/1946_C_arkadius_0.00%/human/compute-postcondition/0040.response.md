The only objects in the loop head are `u` and `tree.vertices[v].children`, so we can only adjust those.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two children, and
- `u` is the second child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop must still have elements to iterate over. Since `u` was the second child in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least three children, and `u` will be the third child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.

State: **`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `v` is the first element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `stack` is a list with the tuple `(v, True)` and `(u, False)` appended to it twice, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least three children, and `u` is the third child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**
