Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is updated to the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack` and is not empty, `v` is updated to the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, and `stack` is a list with at least one tuple remaining, but now with one less tuple. If `postorder` is not empty, the current `v` and its children have not yet been fully processed, and the tuple `(v, True)` has not been appended to `stack` for the current `v`.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `v` is a vertex in `tree` that must have at least one child, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is updated to the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack` and is not empty, `stack` is a list with at least one tuple remaining, but now with one less tuple, and the tuple `(v, True)` has not been appended to `stack` for the current `v`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, the `good_components` value of vertex `v` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components + 1`. Otherwise, the `good_components` value of vertex `v` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and the `remaining_size` of vertex `v` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `v` is a vertex in `tree` that must have at least one child, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is updated to the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack` and is not empty, `stack` is a list with at least one tuple remaining, but now with one less tuple, and the tuple `(v, True)` has not been appended to `stack` for the current `v`. `u` is the next child of `v` in the list of children, and `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].good_components`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `v` is a vertex in `tree` that must have at least one child, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is updated to the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack` and is not empty, `stack` is a list with at least one tuple remaining, but now with one less tuple, and the tuple `(v, True)` has not been appended to `stack` for the current `v`. `u` is the next child of `v` in the list of children, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one more child remaining. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to its previous value plus 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`, and `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].good_components`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
