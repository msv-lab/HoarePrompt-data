The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `tree`, `s`, and `x`. `tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined. `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, and `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree.

The function returns two values:
1. `good_components`: The total number of good components rooted at vertex `s`. A good component is defined as a subtree where the remaining size of each child is less than `x` or the child itself is a good component.
2. `remaining_size`: The remaining size of vertex `s`, which is the sum of the remaining sizes of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.
