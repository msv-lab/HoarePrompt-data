The function `func_4` accepts three parameters: `tree`, `n`, and `k`. `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree with `n` vertices, where `n` is a positive integer indicating the number of vertices in the tree, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` < `n`, indicating the number of edges to be removed. The function returns the largest integer `beg` such that `func_3(tree, n, k, beg)` returns `True`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a Tree object `tree`, a positive integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, and a positive integer `k` (1 <= k < n) representing the number of edges to be removed. It returns the largest integer `beg` for which the function `func_3(tree, n, k, beg)` returns `True`.**
