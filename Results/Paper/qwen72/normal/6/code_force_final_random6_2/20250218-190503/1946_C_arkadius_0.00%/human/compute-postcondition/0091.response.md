Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].good_components`. `v` is a vertex in `tree` that must have at least one child remaining. `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree. `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n. `postorder` is updated to the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack` and is not empty. `stack` is a list with at least one tuple remaining, but now with one less tuple, and the tuple `(v, True)` has not been appended to `stack` for the current `v`. `u` is the next child of `v` in the list of children, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one more child remaining.**
