Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `k` is an integer read from the input, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` as its argument, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, and an edge has been added between `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the `tree` instance.**

Explanation: The code snippet `[u, v] = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `u` and `v`. The previous values of `u` and `v` are overwritten, but the other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `u` and `v` as integers read from the input, while the rest of the initial state remains valid.
