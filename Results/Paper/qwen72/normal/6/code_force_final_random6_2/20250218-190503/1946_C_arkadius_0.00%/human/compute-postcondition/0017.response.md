Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer indicating the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` < `n`, `mid` is now `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, `beg` remains either `(n + 2) // 2` or 1, and `end` is now `mid - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `end` is updated to `mid - 1`.
- `mid` is calculated as `(beg + end + 1) // 2` before the update.
- The values of `tree`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- `beg` remains either `(n + 2) // 2` or 1, depending on its initial value.
- The new value of `end` is `mid - 1`, which is derived from the previous value of `mid`.
