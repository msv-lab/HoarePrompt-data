Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a `Tree` object `tree`, a non-negative integer `s` representing a vertex in the tree, and a non-negative integer `x` such that 0 <= x <= n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree. It modifies the `tree` object so that for each vertex `v` in the tree, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` contains the total number of good components (subtrees where the remaining size of each child is less than `x` or the child itself is a good component) rooted at `v`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of the remaining sizes of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. The function returns the total number of good components rooted at vertex `s` and the remaining size of vertex `s`. The input parameters `s` and `x` remain unchanged. **
