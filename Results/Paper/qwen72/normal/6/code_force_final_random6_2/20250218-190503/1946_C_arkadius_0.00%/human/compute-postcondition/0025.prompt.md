You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is a Tree object representing a tree structure with n vertices, v is an integer representing a vertex in the tree, and x is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges.
def func_2(tree, v, x):
    good_components = 0
    remaining_size = 1
    for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
        good_components_subtree, remaining_size_subtree = func_2(tree, u, x)
        
        good_components += good_components_subtree
        
        if remaining_size_subtree >= x:
            good_components += 1
        else:
            remaining_size += remaining_size_subtree
        
    #State: `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with n vertices, `v` is an integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, `good_components` is the total number of good components found in all the subtrees of `tree.vertices[v].children` plus the number of subtrees whose remaining size is greater than or equal to `x`, and `remaining_size` is the sum of the sizes of all subtrees whose remaining size is less than `x` plus 1.
    return good_components, remaining_size
    #The program returns the total number of good components found in all the subtrees of `tree.vertices[v].children` plus the number of subtrees whose remaining size is greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of the sizes of all subtrees whose remaining size is less than `x` plus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `v` representing a vertex, and a non-negative integer `x`. It returns the total count of good components in the subtrees of `v` plus the number of subtrees with a size of at least `x`, and the sum of the sizes of all subtrees with a size less than `x` plus 1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total number of good components found in all the subtrees of `tree.vertices[v].children` plus the number of subtrees whose remaining size is greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of the sizes of all subtrees whose remaining size is less than `x` plus 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
