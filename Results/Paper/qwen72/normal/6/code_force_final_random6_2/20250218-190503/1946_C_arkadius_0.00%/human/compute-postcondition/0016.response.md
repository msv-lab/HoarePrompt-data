Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer indicating the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` < `n`, `mid` is now `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, `beg` is now `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, and `end` remains either `n` or `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `beg` is updated to `mid`, which is calculated as `(beg + end + 1) // 2`.
- The value of `mid` remains the same as it was before the code execution.
- The value of `end` remains unchanged, still being either `n` or `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`.
- The values of `tree` and `n` are not affected.
- The value of `k` is not affected.
