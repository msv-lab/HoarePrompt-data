Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first two elements removed and the new first element of `a` must be 0, `i` is the last index of the updated list `a`, `res` is 0, `_` is less than `t`, `n` is an input integer.**

The first element of `a` has been removed, so `a` now has the first two elements removed, and the new first element of `a` is 0. The last index `i` of the updated list `a` is still valid. The values of `res`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged.
