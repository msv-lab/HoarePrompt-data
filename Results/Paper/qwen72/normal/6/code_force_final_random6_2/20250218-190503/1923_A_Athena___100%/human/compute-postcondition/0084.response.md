Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed and must have at least one element. `res` is 2 if `a[i]` is 0, otherwise `res` is 1. `i` is `i + 1`, and `i` must be less than the length of `a`. `_` is less than `t`, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- `res` is incremented by 1, so if `a[i]` was 0, `res` is now 2. Otherwise, `res` remains 1.
- The values of `a`, `i`, `_`, and `t` remain unchanged.
- `n` is still an input integer.
