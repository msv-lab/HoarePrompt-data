Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user with the first element removed, `i` is the last index of the updated list `a`, and `res` is 0**

Explanation:
- The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`.
- Initially, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with `a[0]` being 0.
- After the first element (which is 0) is removed, `a` is still a non-empty list of integers, but the first element is no longer 0.
- The last index `i` of the list `a` is now one less than it was before, as the list has been shortened by one element.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.
