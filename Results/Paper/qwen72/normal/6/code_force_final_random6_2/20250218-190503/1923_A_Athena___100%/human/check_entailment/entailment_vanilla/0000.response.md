### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the ribbon.

2. **Trimming the Ribbon**:
   - The program trims the ribbon by removing leading and trailing zeros. This is done using two `while` loops:
     - The first loop removes leading zeros by popping elements from the start of the list `a` until a chip (1) is encountered.
     - The second loop removes trailing zeros by popping elements from the end of the list `a` until a chip (1) is encountered.
   - This step ensures that the list `a` only contains the segment of the ribbon that has chips and is bounded by chips.

3. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - After trimming, the program iterates through the remaining list `a` and counts the number of zeros (free cells) in this segment.
   - The number of zeros in this segment represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the count of free cells in the trimmed segment.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- **Correctness**:
  - The algorithm correctly identifies the segment of the ribbon that contains all the chips and is bounded by chips.
  - The number of free cells in this segment is indeed the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.
  - The program handles all edge cases, such as when there are no free cells between the chips or when the chips are already in a single block.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If the ribbon already contains a single block of chips (e.g., `1 1 1 1 1`), the program will correctly output `0` because there are no free cells to move.
  - If the ribbon has chips at the beginning and end with free cells in between (e.g., `0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0`), the program will correctly output the number of free cells between the chips.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
