Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal, using an operation that assigns a value to a segment of the array with a cost equal to the length of the segment. The provided function `func_1` aims to solve this problem, but its logic and the way it handles the input and output are not entirely aligned with the problem's requirements.

1. **Palindrome Check**: The function `func_1` initially checks if the array is a palindrome. If it is, it returns 0, which is correct because no operation is needed to make all elements equal if they are already the same.

2. **Mismatch Handling**: If the array is not a palindrome, the function tries to find the first mismatching pair of elements from the ends. It then returns the length of the segment between these mismatching elements. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the optimal way to make all elements equal. The cost should be based on the minimum segment that needs to be changed to make all elements equal, not just the segment between the first mismatching pair.

3. **Optimal Solution**: The optimal solution involves finding the most frequent element in the array and then determining the minimum cost to change the rest of the elements to this most frequent element. This can be done by:
   - Counting the frequency of each element.
   - Identifying the element with the highest frequency.
   - Calculating the cost to change all other elements to this most frequent element, which is `n - frequency_of_most_common_element`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases well, such as when the array has only one unique element or when the array is already uniform but not a palindrome.

Given these points, the function `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem as described. It returns the length of the segment between the first mismatching pair, which is not the correct approach to minimize the cost of making all elements equal.

Correctness: **False**
