Output State: **`i` is increased by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `j`, `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `arr[i]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it is now increased by 2 from its original value.
- The condition `i` is less than or equal to `j` remains unchanged.
- The condition `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]` is now `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `arr[i]` because `i` has been incremented.
