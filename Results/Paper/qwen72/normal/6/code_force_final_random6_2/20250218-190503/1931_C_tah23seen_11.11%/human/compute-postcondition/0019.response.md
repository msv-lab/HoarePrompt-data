Output State: **The loop will terminate when `i` is greater than `j` or when `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`. If the loop completes without breaking, `i` will be equal to `j + 1` or `i` will be equal to `j` if the length of `arr` is odd. If the loop breaks, `i` and `j` will be at the positions where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`. The list `arr` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop will continue to run as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j` and the elements at positions `i` and `j` are equal.
- If the loop completes without breaking, it means that the elements from the start to the end of the list `arr` are symmetric (i.e., the list is a palindrome). In this case, `i` will be one more than `j` if the length of `arr` is even, or `i` will be equal to `j` if the length of `arr` is odd.
- If the loop breaks, it means that the elements at positions `i` and `j` are not equal, and the loop will stop at these positions.
- The list `arr` itself remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.
