The variables in the loop head are `i` and the elements of the array `arr`. The loop condition depends on `arr[i]` being equal to `arr[i + 1]`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was increased by 1, and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i - 1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr[i]` must still be equal to `arr[i + 1]` after the increment of `i`.

Since we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we need to ensure that `arr[i]` (which is now `arr[i + 1]` from the previous iteration) is equal to `arr[i + 1]` (which is now `arr[i + 2]` from the previous iteration).

State: **`i` is increased by 1, `i` is less than or equal to `j`, `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`**
