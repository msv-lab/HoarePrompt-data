Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying the Minimum Cost:**
   - The function `func_1` attempts to find the minimum cost by checking if the array is already equal and then tries to find the first and last differing elements.
   - However, this approach does not consider the optimal way to make all elements equal by selecting the most frequent element and minimizing the cost.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the array is already equal correctly. For example, for an array like `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the program should return `0` but it might not always do so.
   - The program also does not handle cases where the array has multiple different elements correctly. For example, for an array like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the correct answer is `4` but the program might return a different value.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should:
1. Identify the most frequent element in the array.
2. Calculate the cost to make all elements equal to the most frequent element by selecting the subarray that needs to be changed.
3. If the array is already equal, the cost is `0`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) from x in input().split(' ')]
    print(min_cost_to_equalize(arr))
    t -= 1

def min_cost_to_equalize(arr):
    from collections import Counter
    freq = Counter(arr)
    most_common_element, most_common_count = freq.most_common(1)[0]
    
    # If the array is already equal
    if most_common_count == len(arr):
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal
    min_cost = len(arr)
    for x in freq:
        cost = 0
        i = 0
        j = len(arr) - 1
        while i <= j:
            if arr[i] == x:
                i += 1
            elif arr[j] == x:
                j -= 1
            else:
                cost += j - i + 1
                break
        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    
    return min_cost
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Counter Usage:** The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each element in the array.
- **Most Frequent Element:** The most frequent element and its count are identified.
- **Already Equal Check:** If the most frequent element appears in all positions, the array is already equal, and the cost is `0`.
- **Minimum Cost Calculation:** For each unique element in the array, the program calculates the cost to make all elements equal to that element by finding the subarray that needs to be changed and updating the minimum cost.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the minimum cost for all test cases.
