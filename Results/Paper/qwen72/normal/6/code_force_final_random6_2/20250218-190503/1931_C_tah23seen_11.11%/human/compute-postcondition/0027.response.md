The variables in the loop head are `i` and the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` must still be true after the previous iteration.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is increased by 2.
- `i` is less than or equal to `j`.
- `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `arr[i]`.

For the loop to execute again, `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]` after `i` has been increased by 2. Since `arr[i - 1]` was equal to `arr[i]` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` is now increased by 2, the new condition to check is whether `arr[i]` (which is now `arr[i + 2]` from the previous iteration) is equal to `arr[i + 1]` (which is now `arr[i + 3]` from the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `arr[i]` (after the increase) is equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

State: **`i` is increased by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `j`, `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`**
