Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal by applying an operation that sets all elements between indices `i` and `j` to a value `x` at a cost of `(j - i + 1)` burles. The function `func_1` attempts to identify the minimum cost by checking if the array is already a palindrome (or can be made a palindrome with a single operation) and then determining the cost of the operation needed to make the array uniform.

1. **Palindrome Check**:
   - The function starts by initializing two pointers, `i` and `j`, at the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then iterates, moving the pointers towards the center, checking if the elements at these positions are equal. If they are, it continues moving the pointers inward.
   - This loop will terminate either when `i` is greater than `j` (indicating the array is a palindrome), or when `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]` (indicating a mismatch).

2. **Handling Palindromes**:
   - If the loop completes without breaking (i.e., `i` is greater than `j`), the function returns `0` because no operation is needed to make the array uniform if it is already a palindrome.

3. **Handling Non-Palindromes**:
   - If a mismatch is found, the function then tries to find the longest segment of the array that is not a palindrome by moving the `i` pointer forward as long as `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
   - After this, it checks if `j` is not the last index of the array. If it is not, it returns the length of the segment from `i` to `j` inclusive, which represents the cost of the operation needed to make the array uniform.
   - If `j` is the last index, it returns the difference between `j` and `i`, which is the cost of the operation needed to make the array uniform.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:
- The function does not correctly handle cases where the array is not a palindrome but can be made uniform with a single operation. Specifically, it does not consider the possibility that the entire array can be made uniform by setting all elements to the value of `arr[i]` or `arr[j]` at a cost of `n` burles, where `n` is the length of the array.

For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`:
- The function will find a mismatch at `i = 0` and `j = 5` and will return `5 - 0 + 1 = 6` burles, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `4` burles, as setting all elements from index `1` to `4` to `1` or `5` will make the array uniform.

Similarly, for the array `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`:
- The function will return `6` burles, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `4` burles, as setting all elements from index `1` to `4` to `1` will make the array uniform.

Therefore, the function does not correctly compute the minimum cost in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
