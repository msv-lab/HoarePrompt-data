Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly compute the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal in some scenarios. Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
5
1 2 2 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Actual Output:
```
2
```

In this case, the program returns 2, but the correct answer should be 3. The program incorrectly breaks out of the loop when it finds the first pair of different elements and does not consider the optimal way to make all elements equal. The optimal solution would be to select the middle three elements (i=2, j=4, x=2), which would cost 3 burles. The program, however, returns 2, which is incorrect.
