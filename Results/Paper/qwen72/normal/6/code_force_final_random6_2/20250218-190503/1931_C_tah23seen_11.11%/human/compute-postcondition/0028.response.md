Output State: **`i` is increased by 3, `i` is less than or equal to `j`, `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially increased by 2, it is now increased by 3.
- The condition `i` is less than or equal to `j` remains unchanged.
- The condition `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]` is still valid, but now `i` is one step further in the array.
