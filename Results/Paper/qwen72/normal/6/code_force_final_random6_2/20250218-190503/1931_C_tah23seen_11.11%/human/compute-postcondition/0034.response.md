The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers where the length of the list is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each element in the list is between 1 and the length of the list.

- **Case_1**: The function returns 0.
- **Case_2**: The function returns the number of elements from index `i` to index `j` inclusive in the list `arr`, where `i` is less than or equal to `j`, and `j` is not the last index of `arr`.
- **Case_3**: The function returns the difference between `j` and `i`, where `j` is the last index of the list `arr` and `i` is the index after being increased by the number of consecutive duplicate elements starting from the initial `i`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns different values based on the following cases: 1) It returns 0. 2) It returns the number of elements from index `i` to index `j` inclusive, where `i` â‰¤ `j` and `j` is not the last index. 3) It returns the difference between the last index `j` and the index `i`, where `i` is incremented by the number of consecutive duplicate elements starting from `i`.**
