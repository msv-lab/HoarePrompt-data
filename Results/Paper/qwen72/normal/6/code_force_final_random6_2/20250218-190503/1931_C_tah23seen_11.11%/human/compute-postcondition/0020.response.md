Postcondition: **The loop will terminate when `i` is greater than `j` or when `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`. If the loop completes without breaking, `i` will be equal to `j + 1` or `i` will be equal to `j` if the length of `arr` is odd. If the loop breaks, `i` and `j` will be at the positions where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`. The list `arr` remains unchanged. Additionally, `i` is greater than `j`.**
