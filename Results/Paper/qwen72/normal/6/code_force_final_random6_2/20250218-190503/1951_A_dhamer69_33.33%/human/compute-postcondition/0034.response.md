Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, the current directory contains subfolders that can be represented as integers within the range [start, end], `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `count_1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the program behaves as described in the if part. If `count_1` is even and `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11', the program behaves as described in the if part. If `count_1` is even and `s` does not contain exactly one occurrence of '11', the program behaves as described in the else part.***
