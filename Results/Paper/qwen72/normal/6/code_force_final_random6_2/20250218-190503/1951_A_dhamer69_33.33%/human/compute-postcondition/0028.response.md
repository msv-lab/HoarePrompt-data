Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, the current directory contains subfolders that can be represented as integers within the range [start, end], `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is a new input string. If `s` == '00', the program behaves as described in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as described in the else part.*** 

However, since both the if and else parts result in the same variable states and relationships, the overall postcondition can be simplified to:
