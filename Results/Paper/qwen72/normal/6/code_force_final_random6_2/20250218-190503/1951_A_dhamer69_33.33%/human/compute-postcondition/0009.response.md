Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, the current directory contains subfolders that can be represented as integers within the range [start, end], `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and its current value is 2, `s` is an input string. If `s` is '00', the program executes the if part. If `s` is not '00', the program executes the else part.**
