Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, the current directory contains subfolders that can be represented as integers within the range [start, end], `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 2, `s` is an input string, and `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`, with `count_1` being even. If `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', then this condition is retained. Otherwise, the number of occurrences of the substring '11' in `s` is not equal to 1.***
