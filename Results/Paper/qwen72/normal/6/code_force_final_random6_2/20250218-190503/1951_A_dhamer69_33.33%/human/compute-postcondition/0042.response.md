Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, the current directory contains subfolders that can be represented as integers within the range [start, end], `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 2, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the new input string. If `s` == '00', the postcondition remains as described. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains as described.***
