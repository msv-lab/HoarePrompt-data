Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the user, and for each of the `t` iterations, it reads another integer `n` and a string `s`. If `n` is 2, it prints 'YES' if `s` is '00', otherwise it prints 'NO'. If `n` is not 2, it prints 'NO' if the number of '1' characters in `s` is odd or if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After `t` iterations, the function terminates, and `t` is 0. The function does not return any value. **
