Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` can be any integer from 1 to 10,000.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0. This means `n` is a positive integer.
   - The function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `a` is a list of characters read from input.
   - `b` is a list of characters read from input.
   - The condition is that if the second-to-last character of `b` is '<', the condition is met. Otherwise, the second-to-last character of `b` is not '<'.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('No')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print` statement that always prints the string 'No'.
   - The initial state provides conditions and variables, but the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints a fixed string 'No'.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or any other conditions, the `print` statement will always output 'No'.

Output: **No**
