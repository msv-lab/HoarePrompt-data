Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, the function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>', `a` and `b` are lists of characters read from input, if the second-to-last character of `b` is '<', the condition is met. Otherwise, the second-to-last character of `b` is not '<', `_` is incremented by 1.** 

In natural language: The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `n` is now assigned the value of an input integer greater than 0. The other conditions and variables (`t`, the list of test cases, `a` and `b`, and the condition related to the second-to-last character of `b`) remain as they were initially. The variable `_` is not affected by this code snippet.
