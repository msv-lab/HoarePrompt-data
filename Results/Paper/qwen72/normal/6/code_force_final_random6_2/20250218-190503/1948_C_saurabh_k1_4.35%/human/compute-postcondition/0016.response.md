The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop iterates a fixed number of times based on the integer value read from the input. Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly named or used, it is incremented implicitly by the `range` function.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
- The function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `a` and `b` are lists of characters read from input.
- If the second-to-last character of `b` is '<', the condition is met. Otherwise, the second-to-last character of `b` is not '<'.

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop counter `_` must be incremented by 1, and the loop will continue as long as `_` is less than the integer value read from the input.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, the function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>', `a` and `b` are lists of characters read from input, if the second-to-last character of `b` is '<', the condition is met. Otherwise, the second-to-last character of `b` is not '<', `_` is incremented by 1**
