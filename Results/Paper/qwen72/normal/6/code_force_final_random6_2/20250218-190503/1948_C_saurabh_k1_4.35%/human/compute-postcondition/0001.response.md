Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, the function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `int(input())` must be greater than 0.**

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and `n` is an even integer within the range 2 to 2·10^5. The code snippet assigns `n` the value of `int(input())`, which must be an integer greater than 0. The other conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
