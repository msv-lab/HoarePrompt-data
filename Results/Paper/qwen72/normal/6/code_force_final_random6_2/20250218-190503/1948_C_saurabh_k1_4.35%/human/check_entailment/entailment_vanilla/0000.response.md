Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and needs to reach cell (2, n). Each second, the robot makes two moves: one chosen by the user (left, right, up, or down) and one determined by the arrow in the current cell. The arrows in the grid are represented by the characters `<` (left) and `>` (right).

2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (the number of columns), and the two strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the first and second rows, respectively.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1).
   - The robot can move left, right, up, or down, but it must move every second and cannot skip a move.
   - After the robot's move, it must follow the arrow in the current cell.

4. **Key Insight**:
   - To reach cell (2, n), the robot must eventually move to the second row and then move right to the last column.
   - The critical point is the second-to-last column in the second row (i.e., cell (2, n-1)). If the arrow in this cell points to the left (`<`), the robot cannot move to cell (2, n) because it will be forced back to the left.

5. **Program Logic**:
   - The program checks if the arrow in the second-to-last column of the second row (`b[n-2]`) points to the left (`<`).
   - If it does, the program prints 'No'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program assumes that `n` is even and that there are no arrows pointing outside the grid, as specified in the problem constraints.
   - The program does not handle the case where the robot might get stuck in a loop or be unable to move to the second row. However, the problem constraints and the nature of the grid (with only left and right arrows) imply that the robot can always move to the second row if it is not blocked by a left arrow in the second-to-last column of the second row.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic is correct for the given problem constraints. It correctly identifies whether the robot can reach cell (2, n) based on the arrow in the second-to-last column of the second row.

Correctness: **True**
