Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, the function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>', `a` is a list of characters read from input, `b` is a list of characters read from input, if the second-to-last character of `b` is '<', the condition is met. Otherwise, the second-to-last character of `b` is not '<', `_` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a = list(map(str, input()))` reads a string from the input and converts it into a list of characters, assigning this list to `a`.
- The initial state mentions that `a` and `b` are lists of characters read from input, so after this code snippet, `a` is now a list of characters.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and the conditions regarding the test cases and the second-to-last character of `b` remain unchanged.
- The variable `_` is not affected by this code snippet, so its state remains as described in the initial state.
