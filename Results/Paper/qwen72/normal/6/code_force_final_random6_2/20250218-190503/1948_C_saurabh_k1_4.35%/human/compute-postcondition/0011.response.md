Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, the function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>', `a` is a list of characters read from input, `b` is a list of characters read from input, if the second-to-last character of `b` is '<', the condition is met. Otherwise, the second-to-last character of `b` is not '<'.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(str, input()))` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of characters, assigning this list to the variable `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of characters read from input, which is now updated to reflect the actual input.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
