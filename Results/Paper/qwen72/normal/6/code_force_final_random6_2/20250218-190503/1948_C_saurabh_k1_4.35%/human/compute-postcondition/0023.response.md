Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, the function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>', `_` is incremented by 1 for each test case where the second-to-last character of `b` is not '<', otherwise `_` remains unchanged for that test case.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and the list of test cases remain unchanged. The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1 for each test case where the second-to-last character of the string `b` is not '<'. For test cases where the second-to-last character of `b` is '<', `_` remains unchanged. The loop has processed all test cases, and the output for each test case is either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the condition checked within the loop.
