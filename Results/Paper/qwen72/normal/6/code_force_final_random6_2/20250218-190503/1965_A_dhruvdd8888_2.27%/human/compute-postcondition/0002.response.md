The code snippet `nums = sorted(map(int, nums))` converts each string in the set `nums` to an integer, sorts the resulting integers in ascending order, and assigns the sorted list back to `nums`.

- `nums` was initially a set of unique strings.
- After the code execution, `nums` is now a list of integers, sorted in ascending order.

The other variables (`test_cases` and `N`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The length of `test_cases` is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `N` is an input integer. `nums` is now a sorted list of integers.**
