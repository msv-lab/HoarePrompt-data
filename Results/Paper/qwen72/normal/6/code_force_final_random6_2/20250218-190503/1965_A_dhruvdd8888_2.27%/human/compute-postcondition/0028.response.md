Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `i` is the index of the last element in `nums` that was checked before the loop terminated. If all consecutive elements from `nums[1]` to `nums[len(nums) - 2]` have a difference of 1, then `cd` is `len(nums) - 3`. Otherwise, `cd` is the number of consecutive elements starting from `nums[1]` that have a difference of 1 before the first non-consecutive pair is found. Additionally, `cd` is even.**
