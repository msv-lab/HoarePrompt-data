The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `nums`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is greater than 3.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- The length of `nums` must still be greater than 3 for `i` to be less than `len(nums) - 2`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `cd` is 2 or 0 depending on the previous condition**
