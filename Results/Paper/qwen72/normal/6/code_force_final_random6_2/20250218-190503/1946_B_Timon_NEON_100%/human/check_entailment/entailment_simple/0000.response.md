### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers and an integer `k`.
   - We need to perform exactly `k` operations where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations and return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.
   - It then calls `func_2(a)` to find the maximum segment sum of non-negative elements.
   - If the maximum segment sum is not found (i.e., `max_segment[0] == -1`), it sets `max_segment[0]` to 0.
   - The answer is calculated as `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - Finally, it prints the result of `func_1(answer)` which returns the answer modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly returns the remainder of `number` when divided by \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is intended to find the maximum segment sum of non-negative elements in the array.
   - However, there are several issues with the implementation:
     - The `new_segment` and `max_segment` lists are initialized with a single element, but they are treated as if they have two elements.
     - The `segments_variants` list is used to store segments, but the logic for appending segments is incorrect.
     - The `total_max_segment` is initialized to `[-1]` and is updated to the segment with the highest sum, but the condition `len(segment) != 1` is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.
     - The function does not handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers correctly.

5. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function is not used in the program and does not contribute to the solution.

### Conclusion:
The program has several logical and implementation issues in `func_2` that can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the handling of segments and the condition for updating `total_max_segment` are flawed. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Correctness:
**False**
