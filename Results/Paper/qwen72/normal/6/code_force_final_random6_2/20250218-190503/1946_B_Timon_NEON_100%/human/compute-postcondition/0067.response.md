Output State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list if the last element of `arr` is negative, otherwise it is `[sum of all non-negative elements from the last segment, index of the last non-negative element]`, `max_segment` is `[sum of the maximum segment of non-negative elements, starting index of the maximum segment]`, `segments_variants` is a list of lists containing the sum of each segment of non-negative elements, the starting index of the segment, and the ending index of the segment, with the last element being `max_segment` followed by `len(arr) - 1`. `total_max_segment` is the segment from `segments_variants` with the highest sum of non-negative elements, provided its length is not 1. If no such segment exists, `total_max_segment` remains `[-1]`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `i` remains `len(arr) - 1`.
- The variable `max_sum` remains -1.
- The variable `new_segment` remains the same as it was after the initial setup: an empty list if the last element of `arr` is negative, otherwise it contains the sum of all non-negative elements from the last segment and the index of the last non-negative element.
- The variable `max_segment` remains the same as it was after the initial setup: it contains the sum of the maximum segment of non-negative elements and the starting index of that segment.
- The variable `segments_variants` remains a list of lists, each containing the sum of a segment of non-negative elements, the starting index of the segment, and the ending index of the segment, with the last element being `max_segment` followed by `len(arr) - 1`.
- The variable `total_max_segment` is updated to the segment from `segments_variants` with the highest sum of non-negative elements, provided its length is not 1. If no such segment exists, `total_max_segment` remains `[-1]`.
