The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `arr` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `arr` must still have at least 2 elements, but since `i` is now 2, `arr` must have at least 3 elements to ensure the loop can continue.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is updated to `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arr[1]` is not negative, or remains as `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is less than 0 or `arr[1]` is negative. `segments_variants` is a list containing either `[0, 0, -1]` or `[arr[1], 1, 0]` depending on the values of `max_segment` and `new_segment`**.
