Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is [arr[0], 0], `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and the current value of `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the first element of `arr` and its index (0) to the list `new_segment`. Since `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` becomes `[arr[0], 0]`. The other variables (`max_segment`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`) remain unchanged, and the initial conditions for `arr` and `i` still hold.
