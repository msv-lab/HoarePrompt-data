Output State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list if the last element of `arr` is negative, otherwise it is `[sum of all non-negative elements from the last segment, index of the last non-negative element]`, `max_segment` is `[sum of the maximum segment of non-negative elements, starting index of the maximum segment]`, `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must have at least two elements, `segment` is the second element in `segments_variants`, `total_max_segment` is now equal to `segment`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `total_max_segment = segment` updates the value of `total_max_segment` to be equal to the value of `segment`.
- The value of `segment` is the second element in `segments_variants`.
- All other variables (`i`, `max_sum`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
