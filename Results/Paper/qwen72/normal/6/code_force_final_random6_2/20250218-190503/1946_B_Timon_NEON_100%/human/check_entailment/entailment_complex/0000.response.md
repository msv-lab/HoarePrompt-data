Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an integer `number` and returns the remainder when `number` is divided by \(10^9 + 7\). This is a straightforward and correct implementation for handling large numbers and ensuring the result fits within the required modulo.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of non-negative elements. However, there are some issues with the logic:
     - The function initializes `max_segment` and `new_segment` in a way that might not correctly handle all edge cases, especially when the array contains only negative numbers.
     - The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` even if they are empty or invalid.
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the entire array is negative. In such cases, the maximum sum should be 0, but the function might return `-1` or an incorrect segment.
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array contains a single non-negative number. In such cases, the maximum sum should be that number, but the function might return `-1` or an incorrect segment.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is not used in the main program. It always returns 0, which is incorrect and not relevant to the problem. However, since it is not called, it does not affect the correctness of the program.

4. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_2(a)` to find the maximum segment sum.
   - If the maximum segment sum is `-1`, it sets it to `0`.
   - It calculates the final answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - It prints the result of `func_1(answer)`.

The main issue lies in `func_2`, which does not correctly identify the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of non-negative elements. This can lead to incorrect results in the main program.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because `func_2` does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when the array contains only negative numbers or a single non-negative number. This can result in an incorrect maximum segment sum, which in turn affects the final answer.
