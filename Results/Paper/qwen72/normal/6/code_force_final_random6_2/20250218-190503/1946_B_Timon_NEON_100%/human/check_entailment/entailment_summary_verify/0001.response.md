### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final answer should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function correctly implements the modulo operation by taking a number and returning it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - This function is correct and can be used to ensure the final result is within the required range.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - The function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
     - However, there are several issues with this function:
       - **Initialization and List Handling:**
         - `new_segment` and `max_segment` are initialized as lists with a single element, which can lead to incorrect indexing and logic.
         - The function does not correctly handle the case where the entire array is negative.
         - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array is empty or has only one element.
       - **Logic for Transitioning Between Positive and Negative Elements:**
         - The function does not correctly update `max_segment` and `new_segment` when transitioning between positive and negative elements.
         - The logic for appending segments to `segments_variants` is flawed, as it can append segments with incorrect indices or sums.
       - **Final Segment Handling:**
         - The function appends the final segments to `segments_variants` but does not handle the case where the entire array is a single segment correctly.
       - **Finding the Maximum Segment:**
         - The function iterates through `segments_variants` to find the segment with the maximum sum, but the condition `len(segment) != 1` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
     - The function is intended to calculate the final answer based on the maximum segment sum and the number of operations.
     - However, the function is incomplete and does not contain any logic to compute the final result.
     - The function initializes `answer` to 0 but does not perform any operations to update it.
     - This function is clearly incorrect and needs to be implemented properly.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach to solve this problem involves:
     - Finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray using Kadane's algorithm.
     - Calculating the total sum of the array.
     - If the maximum subarray sum is non-negative, the final sum is the original array sum plus the maximum subarray sum multiplied by `k`.
     - If the maximum subarray sum is negative, the final sum is just the original array sum (since adding a negative sum multiple times will not increase the total sum).
     - The final result should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program is incorrect because:
     - `func_2` does not correctly find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
     - `func_3` is incomplete and does not perform the necessary calculations.

### Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect due to the issues identified in `func_2` and the incompleteness of `func_3`. These issues prevent the program from correctly solving the problem as described.
