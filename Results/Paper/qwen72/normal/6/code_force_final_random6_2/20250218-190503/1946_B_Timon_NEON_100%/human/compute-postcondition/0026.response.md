Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, or an empty list if `arr[0]` is negative, `max_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `max_segment` + [0].**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, and `max_sum` is -1.
- The code snippet `segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])` appends a new element to the list `segments_variants`.
- `max_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]` based on the initial conditions.
- `i - 1` is 0, so the element appended to `segments_variants` is `max_segment` + [0], which is `[arr[0], 0, 0]`.
- `new_segment` is either `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, or an empty list if `arr[0]` is negative, but this does not affect the current code snippet.
- The values of `arr`, `i`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged.
- The value of `segments_variants` is updated to include the new element.
