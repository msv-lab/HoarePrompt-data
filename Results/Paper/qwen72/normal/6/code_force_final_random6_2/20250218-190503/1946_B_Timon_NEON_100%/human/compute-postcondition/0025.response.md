The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `arr`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `arr` must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `arr` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `max_sum` is -1. If `new_segment` is non-empty, `max_segment` is updated to `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[0]`. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing a single element `[0, 0, -1]`. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to be equal to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [i - 1]. If `new_segment` is empty, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` remains an empty list, and `max_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]`.**
