Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly computes the modulo of a number with \(10^9 + 7\). However, it is not used effectively in the program.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function attempts to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices. However, there are several issues:
     - The `new_segment` and `max_segment` lists are initialized with a single element, but they are used as if they had two elements.
     - The logic for updating `segments_variants` and `max_segment` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the array has only negative numbers.
     - The function appends `new_segment` and `max_segment` to `segments_variants` even if they are not valid segments.
     - The final loop to find the maximum segment is also incorrect because it does not properly handle the case where the array is empty or all segments are invalid.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operation. It is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum after `k` operations, but it is left empty.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, you need to:
1. Calculate the sum of the entire array.
2. Find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.
3. Use the maximum subarray sum to determine the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_sum_after_operations(t, test_cases):
    MOD = 1000000007
    
    def max_subarray_sum(arr):
        max_sum = float('-inf')
        current_sum = 0
        for num in arr:
            current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
        return max_sum
    
    results = []
    for n, k, arr in test_cases:
        total_sum = sum(arr)
        max_subarray = max_subarray_sum(arr)
        
        if max_subarray <= 0:
            result = total_sum
        else:
            result = total_sum + max_subarray * k
        
        results.append(result % MOD)
    
    return results

# Example usage:
t = 12
test_cases = [
    (2, 2, [-4, -7]),
    (3, 3, [2, 2, 8]),
    (1, 7, [7]),
    (5, 1, [4, -2, 8, -12, 9]),
    (7, 4, [8, 14, -9, 6, 0, -1, 3]),
    (7, 100, [5, 3, -8, 12, -5, -9, 3]),
    (6, 1000, [-1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000]),
    (2, 1, [1000000000, 8]),
    (5, 4, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]),
    (6, 10, [48973, 757292, 58277, -38574, 27475, 999984]),
    (7, 1, [-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000, -1000, 1000, -1000]),
    (10, 10050, [408293874, -3498597, 7374783, 295774930, -48574034, 26623784, 498754833, -294875830, 283045804, 85938045])
]

results = max_sum_after_operations(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations by leveraging the maximum subarray sum and the total sum of the array.
