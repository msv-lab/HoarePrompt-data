The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, the list `arr` must have at least one element, and the variable `i` must be set to 0 before the first iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1**
