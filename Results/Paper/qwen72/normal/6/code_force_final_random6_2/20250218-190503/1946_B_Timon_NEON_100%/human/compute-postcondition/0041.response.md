Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is updated to `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arr[1]` is not negative, or remains as `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is less than 0 or `arr[1]` is negative, `segments_variants` is a list containing either `[0, 0, -1]` or `[arr[1], 1, 0]` depending on the values of `max_segment` and `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` now includes the new segment with the last element as `i - 1` (which is 1).**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new segment to `segments_variants` by adding `i - 1` to the end of `new_segment`.
- Since `i` is 2, `i - 1` is 1.
- The new segment is `new_segment + [1]`.
- The initial state of `segments_variants` could be either `[0, 0, -1]` or `[arr[1], 1, 0]` depending on the values of `max_segment` and `new_segment`.
- After appending, `segments_variants` will contain the original segment plus the new segment with the last element as 1.
