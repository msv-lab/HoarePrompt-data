The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is within the range -10^9 to 10^9. The function returns the segment from `segments_variants` with the highest sum of non-negative elements, provided the length of the segment is not 1. If no such segment exists, the function returns `[-1]`.
