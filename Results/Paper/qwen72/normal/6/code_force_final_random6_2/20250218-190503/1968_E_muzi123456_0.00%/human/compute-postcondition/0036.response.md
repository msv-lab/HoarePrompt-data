The given `print` statement is:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the string `'1'`.
- The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function specifies that the output should end with a space character instead of the default newline character. This means that after printing `'1'`, the cursor will remain on the same line, followed by a space.

### Variables and Objects:
- The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'1'` followed by a space character.
Output: **1 **

(Note: The output includes the space character at the end, as specified by the `end=' '` argument.)
