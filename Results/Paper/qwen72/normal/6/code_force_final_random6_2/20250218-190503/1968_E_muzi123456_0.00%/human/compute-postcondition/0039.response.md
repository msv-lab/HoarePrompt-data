The given print statement is:
```
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 47.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.
   - `i` is 3.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` function is called with the string `'1'` as the first argument.
   - The `end` parameter is set to `' '`, which means that after printing the string `'1'`, a space will be printed instead of a newline.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print` function will output the string `'1'` followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 **

Explanation: The print statement will output the number `1` followed by a space. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` do not affect the output of this specific print statement.
