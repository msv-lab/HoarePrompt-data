### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to choose \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \).
   - It then prints \( n \) cells, all of which have the same \( x \)-coordinate (1) and different \( y \)-coordinates ranging from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Evaluating the Output:**
   - The output for each test case is a set of points \((1, 1), (1, 2), \ldots, (1, n)\).
   - The Manhattan distance between any two points \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) is \( |1 - 1| + |i - j| = |i - j| \).

4. **Distinct Manhattan Distances:**
   - The possible values of \( |i - j| \) for \( 1 \le i, j \le n \) are \( 0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1 \).
   - Therefore, the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain \( n \) elements: \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\).

5. **Maximizing the Size of \(\mathcal{H}\):**
   - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \( n \), which is the maximum possible size for \( n \) points in an \( n \times n \) grid.
   - This is because the maximum number of distinct distances between \( n \) points in a 1-dimensional line (which is what the \( y \)-coordinates form in this case) is \( n-1 \), plus the distance 0.

6. **Additional Considerations:**
   - The program does not print an extra space at the end of the answer for each test case, which is not required according to the problem statement.
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by decrementing \( t \) and reading the next \( n \) for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for the given \( n \). It outputs a valid set of points for each test case that achieves the maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Correctness: **True**
