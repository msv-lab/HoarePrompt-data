To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: In the loop head, `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Before the loop starts, `i` is set to the previous value of `n`. This needs to be adjusted because the loop expects `i` to start from 1, not from the previous value of `n`.

2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Since `n` is already given as an input integer greater than or equal to 2, it does not need to be adjusted.

Given these considerations, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` starts from 1 and `n` is at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 47, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1**
