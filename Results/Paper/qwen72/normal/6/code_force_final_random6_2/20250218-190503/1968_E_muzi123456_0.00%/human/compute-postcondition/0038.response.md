The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `i` at 1 and increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration until `i` is no longer less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 47, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3**
