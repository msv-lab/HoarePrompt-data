Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 47.
- `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is 1.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(i)
```

The variable `i` is explicitly defined as 1. Therefore, when the `print(i)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
