Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 47.
  - `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2.
  - `i` is 2.

- **Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  print(i)
  ```

- **Explanation:**
  - The variable `i` is explicitly defined as 2 in the initial state.
  - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(i)` statement is:

Output: **2**
