Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer input by the user such that 0 <= t <= 49.
- `n` is an integer input by the user for the current test case and must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` is 3.

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is explicitly defined as 3.

Output: **3**
