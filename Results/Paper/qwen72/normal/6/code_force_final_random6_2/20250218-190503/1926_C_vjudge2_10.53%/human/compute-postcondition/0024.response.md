Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `n` is the last input integer, `values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `values` is an empty list, `sum_values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `sum_values` is an empty list, `total` is 1, `i` is 2, `values[0]` is 0, `sum_values[0]` is 0, `values[1]` is 1, `sum_values[1]` is 1, `values[2]` is 2.** 

The value of `values[2]` is now 2, while all other variables and list elements remain unchanged.
