Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `n` is the last input integer, `values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `values` is an empty list, `sum_values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `sum_values` is an empty list, `total` is 0, `i` is 0, `values[0]` is 0, `total` is 0.**

The code snippet `total += i` does not change the value of `total` because `i` is 0. Therefore, `total` remains 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
