Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `n` is the last input integer, `values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `values` is an empty list, `sum_values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `sum_values` is an empty list, `total` is 0, `i` is 0, `values[0]` is 0, `sum_values[0]` is 0.**

The code `sum_values[i] = total` assigns the value of `total` (which is 0) to the first element of the `sum_values` list (index 0). Since `i` is 0 and `total` is 0, `sum_values[0]` is now 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
