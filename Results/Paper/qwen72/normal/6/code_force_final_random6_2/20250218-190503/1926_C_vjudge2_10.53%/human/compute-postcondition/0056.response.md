Output State: **`total` is 45, `i` is the last input integer from the `numbers` list, `n` is the last input integer from the `numbers` list, `values` is a list of integers, `sum_values` is a list of integers, `numbers` must be a non-empty list of integers.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `total` remains unchanged at 45.
- The variable `i` will be the last integer in the `numbers` list.
- The variable `n` will also be the last integer in the `numbers` list.
- The `values` list remains a list of integers, and its contents are not affected by the loop.
- The `sum_values` list remains a list of integers, and its contents are not affected by the loop.
- The `numbers` list must have been a non-empty list of integers, and it remains unchanged.
