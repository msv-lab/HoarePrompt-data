The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, so `t` is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing the input integers `n` and the new input integer `n`, `n` is the new input integer.**
