You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer t and a list of integers n, where 1 <= t <= 10^4 and for each n, 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        numbers.append(n)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `n` is the last input integer.
    values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    sum_values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        
        total += i
        
        sum_values[i] = total
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `n` is the last input integer, `values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `values` is an empty list, `sum_values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `sum_values` is an empty list, `total` is 45, `i` is 9, `values[0]` is 0, `sum_values[0]` is 0, `values[1]` is 1, `sum_values[1]` is 1, `values[2]` is 2, `sum_values[2]` is 3, `values[3]` is 3, `sum_values[3]` is 6, `values[4]` is 4, `sum_values[4]` is 10, `values[5]` is 5, `sum_values[5]` is 15, `values[6]` is 6, `sum_values[6]` is 21, `values[7]` is 7, `sum_values[7]` is 28, `values[8]` is 8, `sum_values[8]` is 36, `values[9]` is 9, `sum_values[9]` is 45.
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
        
    #State: `total` is 45, `i` is `n`, `n` is the last input integer, `values` is a list of integers where each value at index `i` is the sum of the values at the indices corresponding to the last digit and the remainder of `i` when split into digits, `sum_values` is a list of integers where each value at index `i` is the cumulative sum of the values in `values` up to index `i`.
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
        
    #State: `total` is 45, `i` is the last input integer from the `numbers` list, `n` is the last input integer from the `numbers` list, `values` is a list of integers, `sum_values` is a list of integers, `numbers` must be a non-empty list of integers.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of integers `n`. It returns a result based on the values of `t` and `n`, where `t` is between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive) and each element in `n` is between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
