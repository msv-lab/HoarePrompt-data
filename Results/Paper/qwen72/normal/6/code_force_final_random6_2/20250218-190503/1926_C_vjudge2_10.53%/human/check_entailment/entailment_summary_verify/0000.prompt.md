You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)

    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of integers to be processed. It then reads `t` integers from user input and stores them in a list `numbers`. The function initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, with a length of `max(numbers) + 1` (if `numbers` is not empty) to store specific integer values and their cumulative sums, respectively. The first 10 elements of `values` and `sum_values` are set to the integers 0 through 9 and their cumulative sums, respectively. For each integer `i` from 10 to the maximum value in `numbers`, the function calculates the value at index `i` in `values` as the sum of the values at the indices corresponding to the last digit and the remainder of `i` when split into digits. The cumulative sum up to `i` is stored in `sum_values`. Finally, the function prints the cumulative sum for each integer in `numbers`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input `n` is greater than the maximum value in the `numbers` list. Specifically, the loop `for i in range(10, n + 1):` uses the variable `n` from the last input, but it should use the maximum value from the `numbers` list instead. This can lead to incorrect results for some test cases. For example, if the input is:

```
2
12
20
```

The program will only compute the sums up to `n = 20`, but it will not correctly handle the case where `n = 12` if it is not the maximum value in the `numbers` list. The correct approach would be to compute the sums up to the maximum value in the `numbers` list and then use those precomputed values for each test case.
