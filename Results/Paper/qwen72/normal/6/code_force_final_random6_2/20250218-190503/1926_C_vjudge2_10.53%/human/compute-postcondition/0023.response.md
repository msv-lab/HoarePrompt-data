The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit, which is 10. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and it must still be less than 10.

State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `n` is the last input integer, `values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `values` is an empty list, `sum_values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `sum_values` is an empty list, `total` is 1, `i` is 2, `values[0]` is 0, `sum_values[0]` is 0, `values[1]` is 1, `sum_values[1]` is 1.**
