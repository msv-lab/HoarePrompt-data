Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `total` is 45.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` is the first input integer from the `numbers` list.
   - `values` is a list of integers.
   - `sum_values` is a list of integers.
   - `numbers` must be a non-empty list of integers.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(sum_values[n])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `n` is the first element of the `numbers` list. Since `numbers` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` will be an integer.
   - `i` is set to `n`, so `i` is also the first element of the `numbers` list.
   - The `print` statement is accessing the element at index `n` in the `sum_values` list. This means it will print the value of `sum_values` at the position specified by `n`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The exact value of `n` is not provided, but it is the first element of the `numbers` list.
   - The exact value of `sum_values[n]` depends on the contents of the `sum_values` list and the value of `n`.
   - Since we don't have the specific values of `numbers` and `sum_values`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be the value at the index `n` in the `sum_values` list, where `n` is the first element of the `numbers` list.

Output: **sum_values[n] (where n is the first element of the numbers list and sum_values is a list of integers)**
