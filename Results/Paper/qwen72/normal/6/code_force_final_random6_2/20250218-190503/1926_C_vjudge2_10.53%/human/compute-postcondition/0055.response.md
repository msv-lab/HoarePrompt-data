Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `total` is 45.
   - `i` is the third input integer from the `numbers` list.
   - `n` is the third input integer from the `numbers` list.
   - `values` is a list of integers.
   - `sum_values` is a list of integers.
   - `numbers` must be a non-empty list of integers with at least 3 elements.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(sum_values[n])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `n` is the third element of the `numbers` list. Since `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `n` will be an integer.
   - The `print` statement is trying to access the element at index `n` in the `sum_values` list.
   - The exact value of `n` depends on the third element of the `numbers` list.
   - The exact value of `sum_values[n]` depends on the value of `n` and the contents of the `sum_values` list.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `numbers` and `sum_values` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.
   - The `print` statement will output the integer at index `n` in the `sum_values` list, where `n` is the third element of the `numbers` list.

Output: **sum_values[n] (where n is the third element of the `numbers` list and sum_values[n] is the element at index n in the `sum_values` list)**
