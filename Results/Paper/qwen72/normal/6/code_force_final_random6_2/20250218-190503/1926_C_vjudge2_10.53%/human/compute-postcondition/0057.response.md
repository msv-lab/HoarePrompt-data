The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of integers `n`. The integer `t` must be within the range 1 to 10,000 (inclusive), and each element in the list `n` must be within the range 1 to 200,000 (inclusive).

However, the provided function signature does not include these parameters. Assuming the correct function signature should be:
```
def func_1(t, n):
```

Given the constraints and relationships, the function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, I will assume the function returns a result based on the parameters `t` and `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of integers `n`. It returns a result based on the values of `t` and `n`, where `t` is between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive) and each element in `n` is between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive).**
