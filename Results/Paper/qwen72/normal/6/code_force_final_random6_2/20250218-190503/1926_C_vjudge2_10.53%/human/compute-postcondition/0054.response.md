The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n` and the list `numbers`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has more elements, the loop will continue to the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second input integer from the `numbers` list, `n` is the second input integer from the `numbers` list, and `numbers` must be a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must have at least 3 elements, and `n` will be the third input integer from the `numbers` list.

State: **`total` is 45, `i` is the third input integer from the `numbers` list, `n` is the third input integer from the `numbers` list, `values` is a list of integers, `sum_values` is a list of integers, `numbers` must be a non-empty list of integers with at least 3 elements**
