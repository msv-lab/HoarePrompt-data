Output State: **`total` is 45, `i` is 12, `n` must be greater than or equal to 12, `values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `sum_values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `word` is '12', `last` is 2, `remainder` is 1, `values[10]` is `values[0] + values[1]`, `values[11]` is `values[1] + values[1]`, `sum_values[10]` is `values[10] + sum_values[9]`, `sum_values[11]` is `values[11] + sum_values[10]`, `sum_total` is `values[11] + sum_values[10]`.**

The code `remainder = int(word[:-1])` updates the value of `remainder` to 1 by converting the substring of `word` (excluding the last character) to an integer. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
