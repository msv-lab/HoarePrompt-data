Output State: **`total` is 45, `i` is 12, `n` must be greater than or equal to 12, `values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `sum_values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `word` is '12', `last` is 2, `remainder` is 1, `values[10]` is `values[0] + values[1]`, `values[11]` is `values[1] + values[1]`, `sum_values[10]` is `values[10] + sum_values[9]`, `sum_values[11]` is `values[11] + sum_values[10]`, `sum_total` is `values[12] + sum_values[11]`, `values[12]` is `values[2] + values[1]`, `sum_values[12]` is `sum_total`.**

Explanation:
- The code `sum_values[i] = sum_total` assigns the value of `sum_total` to `sum_values[12]` because `i` is 12.
- `sum_total` is calculated as `values[12] + sum_values[11]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
