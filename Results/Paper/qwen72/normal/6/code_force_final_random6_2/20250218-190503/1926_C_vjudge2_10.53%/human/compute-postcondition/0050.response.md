The only objects in the loop head are the variable `n` and the list `numbers`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `n` will be set to the first element of the `numbers` list at the start of the loop.

State: **`total` is 45, `i` is `n`, `n` is the first input integer from the `numbers` list, `values` is a list of integers, `sum_values` is a list of integers, `numbers` must be a non-empty list of integers**
