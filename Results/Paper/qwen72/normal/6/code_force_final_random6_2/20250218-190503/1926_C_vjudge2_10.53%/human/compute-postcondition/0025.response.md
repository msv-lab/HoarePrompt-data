Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `n` is the last input integer, `values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `values` is an empty list, `sum_values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `sum_values` is an empty list, `total` is 3, `i` is 2, `values[0]` is 0, `sum_values[0]` is 0, `values[1]` is 1, `sum_values[1]` is 1, `values[2]` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `i`.
- The initial value of `total` is 1, and the value of `i` is 2.
- Therefore, `total` becomes 3.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
