Output State: **`total` is 45, `i` is 10, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `sum_values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `word` is '10', `last` is 0.** 

The code snippet assigns the last character of the string `word` to the variable `last` after converting it to an integer. Since `word` is '10', the last character is '0', and `int('0')` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
