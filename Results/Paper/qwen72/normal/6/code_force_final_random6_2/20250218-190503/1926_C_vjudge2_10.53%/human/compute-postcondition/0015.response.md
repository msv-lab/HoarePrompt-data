The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range `10`, so we can only adjust those. The loop `for i in range(10):` will execute 10 times regardless of the initial state of `t`, `numbers`, `n`, `values`, `sum_values`, and `total`. However, to ensure the loop starts correctly, we need to set `i` to 0, as this is the starting point for the iteration.

Since the loop will execute 10 times, the range `10` is already defined correctly and does not need to be adjusted. The variable `i` is implicitly set to 0 by the `range(10)` function at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to:
State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `n` is the last input integer, `values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `values` is an empty list, `sum_values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `sum_values` is an empty list, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
