The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 10, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to the new value of `i`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, making it 11.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 11 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`total` is 45, `i` is 11, `n` must be greater than or equal to 11, `values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `sum_values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `word` is '10', `last` is 0, `remainder` is 1, `values[10]` is `values[0] + values[1]`, `sum_values[10]` is `values[10] + sum_values[9]`**
