Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `n` is the last input integer, `values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `values` is an empty list, `sum_values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `sum_values` is an empty list, `total` is 45, `i` is 9, `values[0]` is 0, `sum_values[0]` is 0, `values[1]` is 1, `sum_values[1]` is 1, `values[2]` is 2, `sum_values[2]` is 3, `values[3]` is 3, `sum_values[3]` is 6, `values[4]` is 4, `sum_values[4]` is 10, `values[5]` is 5, `sum_values[5]` is 15, `values[6]` is 6, `sum_values[6]` is 21, `values[7]` is 7, `sum_values[7]` is 28, `values[8]` is 8, `sum_values[8]` is 36, `values[9]` is 9, `sum_values[9]` is 45.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all 10 iterations:
- The variable `t` remains 0.
- The list `numbers` remains unchanged, containing `t` input integers.
- The variable `n` remains the last input integer.
- The list `values` is now populated with integers from 0 to 9 at indices 0 to 9, respectively.
- The list `sum_values` contains the cumulative sums of the integers from 0 to 9 at indices 0 to 9, respectively.
- The variable `total` is 45, which is the sum of the first 10 integers (0 through 9).
- The loop index `i` is 9, indicating that the loop has completed its 10th iteration.
