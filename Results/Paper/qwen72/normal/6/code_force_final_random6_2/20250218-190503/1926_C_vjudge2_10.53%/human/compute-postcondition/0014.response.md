Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `n` is the last input integer, `values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `values` is an empty list, `sum_values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `sum_values` is an empty list, `total` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes the variable `total` to 0. Since no other operations are performed, the values of `t`, `numbers`, `n`, `values`, and `sum_values` remain unchanged from their initial state. The output state reflects this by including all the initial conditions and the new value of `total`.
