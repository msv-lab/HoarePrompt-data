Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, `bullets_used` is 0, `can_survive` is True if the loop completes without breaking due to the condition `total_bullets_needed > distance * k`, otherwise `can_survive` is False.**

The code snippet initializes the variable `bullets_used` to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
