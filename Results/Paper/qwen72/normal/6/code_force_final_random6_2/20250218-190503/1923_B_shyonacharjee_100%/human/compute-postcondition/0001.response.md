The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is not used, so it does not need to be adjusted. 

Given that `t` is an input integer with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
