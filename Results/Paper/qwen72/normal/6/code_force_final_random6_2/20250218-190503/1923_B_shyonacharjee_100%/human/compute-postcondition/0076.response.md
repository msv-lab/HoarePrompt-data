Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple and must have at least 1 tuple, `pos` is the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_used` is 0, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, and `total_bullets_needed` is equal to `health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance` multiplied by `k`, `can_survive` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains True.***
