Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9), a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), x is a list of n integers (-n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ... < x_n ≤ n; x_i ≠ 0). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
    bullets_used = 0
    can_survive = True
    for pos, health in monsters:
        distance = abs(pos)
        total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
        if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
            can_survive = False
            break
        bullets_used += health
    print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` and `x` are lists of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, where each tuple consists of an element from `x` and the corresponding element from `a`. `bullets_used` is the sum of the `health` values of all the tuples in `monsters` that were processed before the loop broke or completed. `can_survive` is True if the loop completed without breaking, or False if the loop broke because `total_bullets_needed` exceeded `distance * k` at any point.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` and `x` are lists of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all the tuples in `monsters` that were processed before the loop broke or finished, `can_survive` is True if the loop completes without breaking due to the condition `total_bullets_needed > distance * k`, otherwise `can_survive` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all the monsters processed, `can_survive` is False if at any point the total bullets needed exceeds the distance multiplied by `k` for any monster, otherwise `can_survive` remains True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
