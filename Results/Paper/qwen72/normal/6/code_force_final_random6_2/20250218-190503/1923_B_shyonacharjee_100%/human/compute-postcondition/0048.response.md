Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, and must have at least 2 tuples, `bullets_used` is `health`, `pos` is the first element of the second tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the second tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `health`, `can_survive` remains True if `total_bullets_needed` is not greater than `distance * k`.**

The code `distance = abs(pos)` updates the value of `distance` to be the absolute value of `pos`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
