Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is the sum of all updated `a[i]` values, `T` is `t`, if `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`. Otherwise, `sumo` is less than `prod`, and `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space. `a` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` reads a space-separated list of integers from the user and updates the list `a` with these integers.
- The other variables (`bets`, `i`, `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo`, `T`, and `ans`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their states remain the same as in the initial state.
