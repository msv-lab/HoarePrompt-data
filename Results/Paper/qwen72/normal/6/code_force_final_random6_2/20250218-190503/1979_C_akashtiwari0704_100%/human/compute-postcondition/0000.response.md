Output State: **The function `func` is not defined with any parameters, but based on the problem description, it should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples `test_cases` where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `k` of length `n`. For each test case, `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= n <= 50`, and `2 <= k_i <= 20` for all `1 <= i <= n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`. `t` is an input integer.**
