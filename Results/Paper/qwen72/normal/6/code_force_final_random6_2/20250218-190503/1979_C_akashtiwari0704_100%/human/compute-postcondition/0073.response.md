Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is the sum of all updated `a[i]` values, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the value of `a[0]` followed by a space and the value of `a[1]` followed by a space.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to include the value of `a[1]` followed by a space.
- The values of `bets`, `i`, `a[i]`, and `sumo` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, and `sumo` is the sum of all updated `a[i]` values and is less than `prod` still holds true.
