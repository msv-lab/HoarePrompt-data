Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]`, `a[1]` is updated to `prod // a[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`. Since `i` is 1, `a[1]` is updated to `prod // a[1]`.
- The values of `bets`, `i`, and `a[0]` remain unchanged.
- The value of `sumo` is still increased by the integer value of `a[0]`, as this was part of the initial state.
- The initial state conditions that `bets` must be greater than 1 and `i` is 1 remain valid.
