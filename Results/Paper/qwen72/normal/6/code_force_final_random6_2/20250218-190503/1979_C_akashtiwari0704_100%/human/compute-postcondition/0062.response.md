The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `bets`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `bets` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2, and `bets` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`bets` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]` and `a[1]`, `a[1]` is updated to `prod // a[1]`**
