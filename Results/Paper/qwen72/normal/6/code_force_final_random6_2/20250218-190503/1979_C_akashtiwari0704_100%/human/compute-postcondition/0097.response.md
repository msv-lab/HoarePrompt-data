Output State: **`bets` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sumo` is `a[0]` (which is now `prod // a[0]`), `T` is `t`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, and `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sumo` is updated to `a[0]`.
- Since `a[0]` was previously updated to `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` now holds the value of `prod // a[0]`.
- All other variables (`bets`, `i`, `T`, `ans`, `a`, `prod`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
