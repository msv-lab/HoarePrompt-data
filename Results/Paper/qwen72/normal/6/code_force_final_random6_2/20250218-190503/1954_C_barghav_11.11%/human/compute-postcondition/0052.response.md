Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes two input strings `a` and `b` of equal length, where each character is a digit from 1 to 9. For the first half of the strings, it swaps the characters such that `a` contains the maximum and `b` contains the minimum of the corresponding characters. For the second half, it swaps the characters such that `a` contains the minimum and `b` contains the maximum of the corresponding characters. The function then prints the modified `a` and `b` strings, each followed by a newline. The function does not return any value and does not modify the original input strings `x` and `y`. The number of test cases `t` is not directly used or modified within the function. **
