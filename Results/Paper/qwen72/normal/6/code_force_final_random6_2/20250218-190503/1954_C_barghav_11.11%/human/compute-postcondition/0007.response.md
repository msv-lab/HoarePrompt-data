Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of `x` and `y` is between 1 and 100 digits, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus 1, `a[i]` is now equal to `m`, `b[i]` is now equal to `n`, `m` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `n` is the minimum value between the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**
