Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters, x and y, which are integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x and y is between 1 and 100 digits. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept the number of test cases and the pairs of integers for each test case. Here is a corrected function definition:

```
def maximize_product(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `x` and `y`.

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of t tuples, where each tuple contains two integers x and y. Each of x and y is an integer of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x and y is between 1 and 100 digits.**
