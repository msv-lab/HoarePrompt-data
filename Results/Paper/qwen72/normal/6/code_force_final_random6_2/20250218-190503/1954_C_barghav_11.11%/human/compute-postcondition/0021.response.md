Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of `x` and `y` is between 1 and 100 digits. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, and `b` is a list of characters from the new input string. `i` is `len(a) // 2`, and `len(a)` must be greater than `len(a) // 2`. `a[i]` is now the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. `n` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. `m` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**
