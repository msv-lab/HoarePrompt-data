You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, x and y, which are integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x and y is between 1 and 100 digits. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = m
            b[i] = n
        else:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = n
            b[i] = m
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `x` and `y` remain integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of `x` and `y` is between 1 and 100 digits. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings `x` and `y`, respectively. For the first half of the characters in `a` and `b` (up to `len(a) // 2 - 1`), each character in `a` is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`, and each character in `b` is the minimum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`. For the second half of the characters in `a` and `b` (from `len(a) // 2` to the end), each character in `a` is the minimum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`, and each character in `b` is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: `x` and `y` remain integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of `x` and `y` is between 1 and 100 digits. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings `x` and `y`, respectively, with `a` having at least `len(a)` characters. For the first half of the characters in `a` and `b` (up to `len(a) // 2 - 1`), each character in `a` is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`, and each character in `b` is the minimum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`. For the second half of the characters in `a` and `b` (from `len(a) // 2` to the end), each character in `a` is the minimum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`, and each character in `b` is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`. `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline character)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: The loop has printed all characters in `b` from index 0 to the last index, and `i` has been redefined by the loop to be the last index of `b`. The state of `x`, `y`, `a`, and `t` remains unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a blank line)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `x` and `y` of the same length (1 to 100 digits) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. It returns a result for each test case based on the logic applied to `x` and `y`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
