Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`.**

Explanation:
- The code `n = len(N)` updates the value of `n` to the length of `N`.
- The previous value of `n` (which was the length of `N` minus 1) is no longer valid.
- The new value of `n` is now the actual length of `N`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
