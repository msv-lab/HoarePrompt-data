### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of ticket prices `M`.

2. **Constraints Handling**:
   - The program sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed. This is correct and necessary.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `M` in ascending order. This is a good strategy because it allows us to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days**:
   - The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`, which is the minimum number of days required to buy `k` tickets. This is correct.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days**:
   - The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to get the cheapest prices. This is a valid approach because we want to minimize the cost.

6. **Cost Calculation**:
   - **Case 1: `n * m == k`**:
     - The program calculates the cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. This is incorrect because the additional cost due to price increases is not correctly calculated. The correct additional cost should be `m * sum(range(n))`, which is `m * (n - 1) * n // 2`.
   - **Case 2: `n * m != k`**:
     - The program calculates the cost for the last day separately and then adds the cost for the remaining days. However, the additional term `n * m * mu` is incorrect and can lead to an overestimation of the cost. The correct additional cost should be `mu * sum(range(n))`, which is `mu * (n - 1) * n // 2`.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (n, m, k) = (L[0], L[1], L[2])
        m = min(m, k)
        M.sort()
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        N = M[:q]
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * (n - 1) * n // 2
        else:
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = m * sum(N[:-1]) + m * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2 + mu * N[-1] + mu * (n - 1)
        
        print(cost)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Cost Calculation for Exact Multiples**:
  - If `n * m == k`, the cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * (n - 1) * n // 2`. This correctly accounts for the total cost of buying `m` tickets each day for `n` days and the additional cost due to price increases.
- **Cost Calculation for Non-Exact Multiples**:
  - If `n * m != k`, the program calculates the cost for the first `n-1` days and then the cost for the last day separately.
  - `mu` is the number of tickets to be bought on the last day.
  - The cost for the first `n-1` days is `m * sum(N[:-1]) + m * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2`.
  - The cost for the last day is `mu * N[-1] + mu * (n - 1)`.

### Final Correctness:
- The original program has issues in the cost calculation for both exact multiples and non-exact multiples of `m`. The corrected program addresses these issues and should provide the correct minimum spending.

Final: **False**
