To determine what will be printed by the `print(cost)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `L` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
   - `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`.
   - `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
   - `k` is `L[2]`.
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.

2. **Determine `q`:**
   - `q` is calculated as the ceiling of `k / m`. This means `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`.

3. **Determine `N`:**
   - If `n * m` equals `k`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.
   - Otherwise, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`.

4. **Calculate `cost`:**
   - If `n * m` equals `k`:
     \[
     \text{cost} = m \times \sum(N) + m \times m \times \left(\frac{(n - 1) \times n}{2}\right)
     \]
   - Otherwise:
     - `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
     - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
     \[
     \text{cost} = \mu \times w + m \times \sum(N) + m \times m \times \left(\frac{(n - 1) \times n}{2}\right) + n \times m \times \mu
     \]

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(cost)` statement will print the value of `cost` based on the conditions described above.

Since the exact values of `L` and `M` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cost`. However, we can describe the value of `cost` in terms of the given variables and conditions.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the conditions: if \( n \times m = k \), then \( \text{cost} = m \times \sum(N) + m \times m \times \left(\frac{(n - 1) \times n}{2}\right) \); otherwise, \( \text{cost} = \mu \times w + m \times \sum(N) + m \times m \times \left(\frac{(n - 1) \times n}{2}\right) + n \times m \times \mu \), where \( \mu = k - (n - 1) \times m \) and \( w \) is the last element of the original \( N \))**
