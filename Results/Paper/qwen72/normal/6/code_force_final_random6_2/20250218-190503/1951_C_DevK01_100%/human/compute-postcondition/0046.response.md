Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.**

Explanation:
- `N` is assigned the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged.
- `N` is now a list containing the first `q` elements from the sorted list `M`.
