Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes the variables `t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost`.
- The code snippet updates the value of `cost` by adding the expression `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` to the existing value of `cost`.
- The new value of `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
