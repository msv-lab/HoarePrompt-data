Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 2 (this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `L` is a new list of integers provided by the user.
- `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
- `n` is the length of `N` (note: `N` is not defined yet, but it will be defined later).
- `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
- `k` is `L[2]`.
- `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
if n * m == k:
    N = M[:q]
    cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
else:
    N = M[:q-1]
    w = M[-1]  # This should be the last element of the original `N`, but since `N` is redefined, it's the last element of `M[:q-1]`
    mu = k - (n - 1) * m
    cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu

print(cost)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `m` and `k`**:
   - `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
   - `k` is `L[2]`.

2. **Calculate `q`**:
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.

3. **Determine the length `n`**:
   - `n` is the length of `N`, but `N` is not defined yet. We need to determine `N` based on the condition `n * m == k`.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - If `n * m == k`:
     - `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.
     - `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise:
     - `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`.
     - `w` is the last element of `N` (which is the last element of `M[:q-1]`).
     - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
     - `cost` is calculated as `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

5. **Output**:
   - The `print(cost)` statement will print the value of `cost` based on the above conditions.

### Precise Description:
- **If `n * m == k`**:
  - `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.
  - `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
  - Output: **cost (where cost is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` and `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`)**

- **Otherwise**:
  - `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`.
  - `w` is the last element of `N` (which is the last element of `M[:q-1]`).
  - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
  - `cost` is calculated as `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.
  - Output: **cost (where cost is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of `N`, and `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`)**

### Final Output:
Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the conditions provided: if `n * m == k`, cost is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` and `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`; otherwise, cost is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of `N`, and `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`)**
