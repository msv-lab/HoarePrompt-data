Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`.**

Explanation:
- The code `w = N.pop()` removes the last element from the list `N` and assigns it to the variable `w`.
- The length of `N` is now `q-1` because one element has been removed.
- The value of `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
