Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`. If `n * m` equals `k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**

Explanation:
- The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `L` to a new list of integers provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `cost` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this code snippet.
- The new value of `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, and the rest of the initial state remains valid.
