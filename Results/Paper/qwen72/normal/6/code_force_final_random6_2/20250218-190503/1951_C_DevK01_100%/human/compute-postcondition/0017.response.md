The code snippet updates the value of `cost` by adding to it the result of the expression `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

Let's break down the changes step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `L` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
   - `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`.
   - `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
   - `k` is `L[2]`.
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.
   - `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`.
   - `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
   - `n * m` is not equal to `k`.
   - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
   - `cost` is `mu * w`.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The expression `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` is evaluated and added to `cost`.
   - `sum(N)` is the sum of the first `q-1` elements of `M`.
   - `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is the sum of the first `n-1` natural numbers multiplied by `m` squared.
   - `n * m * mu` is the product of `n`, `m`, and `mu`.

3. **Updated Values:**
   - `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

4. **Output State:**
   - `t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `L` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
   - `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`.
   - `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
   - `k` is `L[2]`.
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.
   - `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`.
   - `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
   - `n * m` is not equal to `k`.
   - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
   - `cost` is now `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is now `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
