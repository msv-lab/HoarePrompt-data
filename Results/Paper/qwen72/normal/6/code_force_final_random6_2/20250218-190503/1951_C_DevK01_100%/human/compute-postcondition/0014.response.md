Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `n * m` is not equal to `k`, and `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mu = k - (n - 1) * m` calculates the value of `mu` based on the existing values of `k`, `n`, and `m`. The value of `mu` is computed as the difference between `k` and the product of `(n - 1)` and `m`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
