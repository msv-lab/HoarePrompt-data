Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. If `n * m == k`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.***
