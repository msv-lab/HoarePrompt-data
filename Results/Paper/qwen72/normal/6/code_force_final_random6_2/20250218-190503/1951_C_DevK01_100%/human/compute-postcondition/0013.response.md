Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, and `n * m` is not equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `w = N.pop()` removes the last element from the list `N` and assigns it to the variable `w`. The list `N` now contains the first `q-1` elements of `M`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
