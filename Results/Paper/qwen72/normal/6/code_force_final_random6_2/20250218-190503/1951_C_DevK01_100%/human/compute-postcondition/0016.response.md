Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`, `n` is the length of `N`.**

Explanation:
- The code `n = len(N)` updates the value of `n` to be the length of the list `N`.
- `N` is defined as the first `q-1` elements of `M`.
- Therefore, `n` is now the length of `N`, which is `q-1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
