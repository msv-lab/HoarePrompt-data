Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of `N` minus 1, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`.**

Explanation:
- `cost` is assigned the value of `mu * w`.
- `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`.
- `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `w` remain unchanged.
- The value of `cost` is now `mu * w`.
