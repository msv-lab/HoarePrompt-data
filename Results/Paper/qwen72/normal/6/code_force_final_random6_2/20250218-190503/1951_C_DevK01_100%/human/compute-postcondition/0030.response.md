Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**

Explanation:
- `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
  - `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
  - `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, where `q` is the ceiling of `k / m` and `k` is `L[2]`.
  - `n` is the length of `N`.
  - `sum(N)` is the sum of the elements in `N`.
  - `((n - 1) * n // 2)` is the sum of the first `n-1` natural numbers.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
