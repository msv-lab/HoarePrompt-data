The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a`, `p`, `s`, and `k`. 

- `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9.
- `p` is a list of integers of the same length `n` as `a`, and it is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
- `s` is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, where each element `s[i]` satisfies 1 <= s[i] <= n.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9.

The function returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop execution, where `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` for each position `s` visited in the loop, `k` is the remaining number of iterations, and `a[s]` is the value at position `s` in the list `a`.
