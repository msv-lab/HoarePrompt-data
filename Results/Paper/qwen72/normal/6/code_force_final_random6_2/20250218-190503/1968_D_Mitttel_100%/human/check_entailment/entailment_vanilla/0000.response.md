### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 from each element to convert them from 1-based to 0-based indexing.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` and playing for `k` turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score.
   - It creates a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions in the permutation to avoid infinite loops.
   - The while loop continues as long as the current position `s` has not been visited and there are still turns left (`k > 0`).
   - Inside the loop:
     - It marks the current position `s` as visited.
     - It updates `mx` to the maximum of `mx` and the score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns (`cur + k * a[s]`).
     - It adds the score of the current position to `cur`.
     - It decrements `k` by 1.
     - It moves to the next position `s` in the permutation.

3. **Score Calculation and Comparison:**
   - The main loop calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha with their respective starting positions and the number of turns `k`.
   - It then compares the scores:
     - If the scores are equal, it prints "Draw".
     - If Bodya's score is greater, it prints "Bodya".
     - If Sasha's score is greater, it prints "Sasha".

4. **Edge Cases and Infinite Loops:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where a player might get stuck in a cycle within the permutation by using the `vis` list to avoid infinite loops.
   - The maximum score calculation (`mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`) ensures that the player's score is maximized by considering the best possible score if they stay at the current position for the remaining turns.

5. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic of the game is correctly implemented. Each player can either stay at their current position or move to the next position in the permutation, and the program correctly simulates this for `k` turns.
   - The comparison of scores at the end of the game is straightforward and correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the game logic and handle the input and output as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
