Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of the previous `mx` value (which was 0) and `cur + k * a[s[0]]` or `cur + k * a[s[1]]` (whichever is larger). `cur` is now `a[s[0]] + a[s[1]] + a[s]`. `vis[s[0]]` and `vis[s[1]]` are 1. `a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`, and `p` is a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`. `s` is a list of two integers representing the new starting positions of Bodya and Sasha. `k` is a positive integer such that `0 <= k <= 10^9 - 2`. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0, except `vis[s[0]]` and `vis[s[1]]` which are 1.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `k` is `k - 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
