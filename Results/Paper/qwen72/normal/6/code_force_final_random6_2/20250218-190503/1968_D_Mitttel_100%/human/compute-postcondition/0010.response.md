The variables in the loop head are `vis[s]` and `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `vis[s]` must be 0 and `k` must be greater than 0.

- `vis[s]` must be 0: This means that the current position `s` (which is a list of two integers representing the positions of Bodya and Sasha) should not have been visited yet. Since `vis[s[0]]` and `vis[s[1]]` are already 1, `s` must change to a new position where `vis[s[0]]` and `vis[s[1]]` are 0.
- `k` must be greater than 0: This condition is already met as `k` is a positive integer. Therefore, `k` does not need to be adjusted.

Since the exact new positions of `s` are not specified, we can only state that `s` must be updated to a new position where `vis[s[0]]` and `vis[s[1]]` are 0.

State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`, and `p` is a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`. `s` is a list of two integers representing the new starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, where `s[0]` and `s[1]` must be positions such that `vis[s[0]]` and `vis[s[1]]` are 0. `k` is a positive integer such that `0 <= k <= 10^9 - 1`. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is the maximum of the previous `mx` value (which was 0) and `cur + k * a[s[0]]` or `cur + k * a[s[1]]` (whichever is larger). `cur` is now `a[s[0]] + a[s[1]]`. `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0, except `vis[s[0]]` and `vis[s[1]]` which are 1.**
