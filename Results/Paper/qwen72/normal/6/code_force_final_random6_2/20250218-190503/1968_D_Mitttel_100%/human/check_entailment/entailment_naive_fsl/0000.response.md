Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in the function `func_1`. Specifically, the program incorrectly modifies the `a` array by subtracting 1 from each element, which is not required according to the problem description. The `a` array represents the scores at each position, and these values should not be altered. This modification can lead to incorrect scores being calculated, which will affect the outcome of the game.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```
The correct output should be:
```
Bodya
```
However, the program will incorrectly modify the `a` array to `[6, 1, 4, 5]` and then proceed with the game, leading to incorrect scores and potentially an incorrect winner.
