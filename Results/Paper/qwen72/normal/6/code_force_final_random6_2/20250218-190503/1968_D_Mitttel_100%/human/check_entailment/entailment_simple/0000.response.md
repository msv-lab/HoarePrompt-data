Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Adjustment**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` to be 0-based by subtracting 1 from each element. This is necessary because Python uses 0-based indexing, while the problem description uses 1-based indexing.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` and playing for `k` turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score encountered.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score.
   - It initializes `vis` to a list of zeros, which will track visited positions to detect cycles.
   - The loop runs as long as the current position `s` has not been visited (`vis[s]` is 0) and there are still turns left (`k > 0`).
   - Inside the loop:
     - It marks the current position `s` as visited.
     - It updates `mx` to the maximum of its current value and the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns (`cur + k * a[s]`).
     - It adds the score at the current position to `cur`.
     - It decrements `k` to account for the turn taken.
     - It moves the player to the next position `p[s]`.
   - The loop terminates when either the position `s` is visited again (indicating a cycle) or `k` reaches 0.
   - The function returns the maximum score `mx`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha with their respective starting positions and the number of turns `k`.
   - It compares the scores and prints the result:
     - "Draw" if both scores are equal.
     - "Bodya" if Bodya's score is greater.
     - "Sasha" if Sasha's score is greater.

4. **Cycle Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles cycles by using the `vis` list to detect when a position is visited again. This is crucial because the game can last for a very large number of turns (`k` up to \(10^9\)), and without cycle detection, the program could run indefinitely or incorrectly.

5. **Score Calculation**:
   - The score calculation within the loop is correct. The program updates the maximum score `mx` by considering the current score `cur` plus the remaining turns `k` multiplied by the score at the current position `a[s]`. This ensures that the player's score is maximized by either staying at the current position or moving to the next position.

6. **Output**:
   - The output format matches the problem description, printing "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison of the scores.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
