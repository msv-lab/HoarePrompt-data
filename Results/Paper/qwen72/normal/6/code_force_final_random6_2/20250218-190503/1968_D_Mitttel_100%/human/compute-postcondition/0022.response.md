Output State: **The loop terminates when either `vis[s]` is 1 or `k` is 0. At this point, `mx` will be the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop execution. `cur` will be the sum of `a[s]` for each position `s` visited in the loop. `k` will be the remaining number of iterations, which is 0 if the loop terminated due to `k` reaching 0, or a positive integer if the loop terminated due to `vis[s]` being 1. `vis` will be a list of length `n` where each element visited by `s` during the loop will be 1, and all other elements will remain 0.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop continues until either the current position `s` has been visited before (`vis[s]` is 1) or the number of remaining iterations `k` reaches 0.
- `mx` will hold the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` that was computed during the loop execution.
- `cur` will be the sum of the values in the list `a` at the positions visited by `s` during the loop.
- `k` will be the number of iterations remaining after the loop terminates. If the loop terminates because `k` reaches 0, then `k` will be 0. If the loop terminates because `s` has been visited before, `k` will be a positive integer indicating how many iterations were left.
- `vis` will be a list where the elements at the positions visited by `s` during the loop will be 1, and all other elements will remain 0.
