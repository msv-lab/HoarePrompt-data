Output State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`, and `p` is a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`. `s` is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, where `1 <= s[0], s[1] <= n`. `k` is a positive integer such that `1 <= k <= 10^9`. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is 0. `cur` is 0. `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes a new list `vis` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
- The values of `a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, `n`, `mx`, and `cur` remain unchanged.
- The new list `vis` is created and each element is set to 0, reflecting the initial state of the list.
