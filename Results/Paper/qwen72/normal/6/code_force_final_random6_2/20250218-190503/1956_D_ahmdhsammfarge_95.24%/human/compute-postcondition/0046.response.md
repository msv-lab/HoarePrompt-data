Output State: **`lst` remains a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `n`, `sm` is the sum of the first `n - 2` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from the second-to-last element to the end of `lst` plus `(n - (n - 2) + 1) ** 2`. If `sm` > `over_sum`, `r` is `n - 2`, `l` is `n - 1`, and `over_sum` is equal to `sm`.**

Explanation:
- `sm` is updated to the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` (i.e., the first `n - 2` elements) plus the sum of the elements from the second-to-last element to the end of `lst` (i.e., the last two elements) plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2` (which simplifies to `(n - (n - 2) + 1) ** 2` or `3 ** 2` which is `9`).
- The values of `lst`, `i`, `j`, `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` remain unchanged unless `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, in which case `r` is set to `n - 2`, `l` is set to `n - 1`, and `over_sum` is set to `sm`.
