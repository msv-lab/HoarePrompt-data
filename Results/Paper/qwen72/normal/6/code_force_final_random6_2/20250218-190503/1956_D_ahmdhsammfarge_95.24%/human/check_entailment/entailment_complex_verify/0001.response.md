### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of an array by performing a specific operation no more than 5 * 10^5 times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**
   - The function aims to find the subarray `[l, r]` that, when replaced with its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
   - The function iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates a potential new sum.
   - The potential new sum is calculated as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`.
   - **Inaccuracy:** The calculation `(j - i + 1) ** 2` is not the correct way to compute the MEX. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not the square of the subarray length.
   - **Correct Approach:** The MEX should be computed by checking the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray. This can be done using a set or a frequency array.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**
   - The function is intended to generate a sequence of operations to set the subarray `a[l:r]` to the MEX value.
   - The function recursively appends the same subarray indices multiple times, which is not the correct way to achieve the MEX transformation.
   - **Inaccuracy:** The function does not compute the MEX value or update the array accordingly. It simply appends the same indices multiple times.
   - **Correct Approach:** The function should compute the MEX value and apply it to the subarray, then generate the operations list accordingly.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**
   - This function is supposed to apply the MEX operation to the subarray `a[l:r]` and update the array and operations list.
   - The function appends the operation to the `ops` list but does not correctly compute the MEX value.
   - The function sets the subarray to the length of the subarray, which is not the MEX value.
   - **Inaccuracy:** The function sets the subarray to the length of the subarray, which is incorrect. It should set the subarray to the MEX value.
   - **Correct Approach:** The function should compute the MEX value of the subarray, set the subarray to this value, and append the operation to the `ops` list.

5. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main program logic repeatedly calls `func_1` to find the optimal subarray and then applies the MEX operation using `func_3`.
   - After all possible MEX operations are applied, it attempts to replace any remaining 0s with 1s.
   - **Inaccuracy:** The MEX computation and the operations generated are incorrect, leading to suboptimal or incorrect results.
   - **Correct Approach:** The main logic should correctly compute the MEX and apply it to the subarray, ensuring the sum is maximized.

### Conclusion:
- The program does not correctly compute the MEX value for the subarray.
- The operations generated by the functions are not valid for achieving the maximum sum.
- The logic for updating the array and generating operations is flawed.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to compute the MEX value and generates incorrect operations. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
