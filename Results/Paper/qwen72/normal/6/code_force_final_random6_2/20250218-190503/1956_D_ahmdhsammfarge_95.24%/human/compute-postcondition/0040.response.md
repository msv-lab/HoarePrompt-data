Output State: **`lst` remains a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `n - 1`, `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from the second-to-last element to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found, and `r` and `l` are the corresponding indices `[i, j]` where this maximum `sm` was found.**

Explanation:
- `lst` remains unchanged.
- `i` is still `n - 2`.
- `j` is still `n - 1`.
- `sm` is updated to the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from the second-to-last element to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2`.
- `over_sum` remains the maximum value of `sm` found.
- `r` and `l` remain the corresponding indices `[i, j]` where this maximum `sm` was found.
