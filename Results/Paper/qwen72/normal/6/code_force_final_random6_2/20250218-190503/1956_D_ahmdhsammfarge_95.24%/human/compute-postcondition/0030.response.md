Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (4 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `sm` is the sum of the first element of `lst` plus the sum of elements from the fourth element to the end of `lst` plus 9, `over_sum` is equal to `sm`, `r` is [1, 3], `l` is [1, 3].**

The code assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. The value of `sm` is the sum of the first element of `lst` plus the sum of elements from the fourth element to the end of `lst` plus 9. The values of `lst`, `i`, `j`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged.
