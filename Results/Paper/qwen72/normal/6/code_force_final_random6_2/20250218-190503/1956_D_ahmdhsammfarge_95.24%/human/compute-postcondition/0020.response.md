The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `lst`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of `lst`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `lst` must still have a length greater than `i`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented to 1.
- The length of `lst` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is 1, `r` is the value of `i` at the last iteration where `sm` > `over_sum`, `l` is the value of `j` at the last iteration where `sm` > `over_sum`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop iterations.**
