Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (4 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 18), `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `sm` is the sum of the first element of `lst` plus the sum of elements from the fifth element to the end of `lst` plus 16, `over_sum` is updated to `sm` if `sm` > `over_sum`, and in this case, `r` is [1, 4] and `l` is [1, 4]. Otherwise, `over_sum`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged.***
