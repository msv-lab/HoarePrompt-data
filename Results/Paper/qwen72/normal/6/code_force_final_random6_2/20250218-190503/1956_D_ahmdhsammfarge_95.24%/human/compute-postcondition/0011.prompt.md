You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers, r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), and ops is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing the operation parameters.
def func_3(r, l, lst, ops):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if (min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    #State: *`lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing the operation parameters, and `ops` now includes an additional list `[r + 1, l + 1]`. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, the function operates accordingly. Otherwise, the function does not perform any additional operations.
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
    #The program returns the updated list `lst` where the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` consists of `n` elements, each equal to `n`. The variables `r`, `l`, and `ops` remain unchanged, and `n` is still equal to `l - r + 1`. If the minimum value in the original sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` was 0, the function may have performed some operation, but the exact changes are unknown. If the minimum value was not 0, no additional operations were performed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`, and returns the updated list `lst` where the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` consists of `n` elements, each equal to `n`, and `n` is `l - r + 1`. If the minimum value in the original sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` was 0, some unknown operations may have been performed. If the minimum value was not 0, no additional operations were performed.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the updated list `lst` where the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` consists of `n` elements, each equal to `n`. The variables `r`, `l`, and `ops` remain unchanged, and `n` is still equal to `l - r + 1`. If the minimum value in the original sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` was 0, the function may have performed some operation, but the exact changes are unknown. If the minimum value was not 0, no additional operations were performed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
