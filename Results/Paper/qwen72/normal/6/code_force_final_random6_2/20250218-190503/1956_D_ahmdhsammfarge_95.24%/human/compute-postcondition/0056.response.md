Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `lst` remains a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18). `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop iterations, and `r` and `l` are set to the corresponding indices `[i, j]` where this maximum `sm` was found.**

### Explanation:
- **`lst`**: The list `lst` remains unchanged throughout the loop because the loop only reads from it and does not modify it.
- **`i`**: After the outer loop completes, `i` will have been incremented to `n - 1`, which is the last index of the list.
- **`j`**: The inner loop runs for each value of `i`, and for the last iteration of `i`, `j` will also be `len(lst) - 1`.
- **`over_sum`**: The variable `over_sum` is updated to the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop iterations. `sm` is calculated as the sum of elements before `i`, the sum of elements after `j`, plus the square of the number of elements between `i` and `j` (inclusive).
- **`r` and `l`**: These variables are set to the indices `[i, j]` where the maximum `sm` was found. If no such `sm` is found that is greater than the initial `over_sum`, then `r` and `l` will remain `0`. Otherwise, they will be updated to the indices where the maximum `sm` was calculated.
