Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing operations that replace a subarray with the MEX of that subarray.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
   - The operations can be performed no more than 500,000 times.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**:
     - This function is supposed to find the subarray whose replacement with its MEX will maximize the sum of the array.
     - It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential sum if the subarray is replaced with its MEX.
     - The function returns the indices of the subarray that maximizes this potential sum.
     - **Issue**: The function returns `r` and `l` but does not correctly handle the MEX calculation. It simply calculates the sum of the elements before and after the subarray and adds the square of the subarray length, which is not the correct way to determine the MEX.

   - **func_2**:
     - This function is supposed to append the operation parameters to the `ops` list.
     - It recursively appends the operation parameters `[r + 1, l + 1]` and calls itself with `l` decremented by 1.
     - **Issue**: The function appends the same operation multiple times, which is not necessary and can lead to an excessive number of operations.

   - **func_3**:
     - This function performs the actual operation on the array and updates the `ops` list.
     - It appends the operation parameters to `ops` and updates the subarray `lst[r:l + 1]` to the MEX value of the subarray.
     - **Issue**: The function appends the operation parameters multiple times and does not correctly handle the MEX calculation. It sets the subarray to `n` (the length of the subarray), which is not the MEX.

3. **Overall Program Flow**:
   - The main program reads the input, initializes the list `lst` and the operations list `ops`.
   - It repeatedly calls `func_1` to find the optimal subarray and `func_3` to perform the operation until no more operations can be performed.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of the elements in the array and the operations performed.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program does not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray.
   - The operations are appended multiple times unnecessarily, which can exceed the allowed number of operations.
   - The function `func_3` incorrectly sets the subarray to the length of the subarray instead of the MEX.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem description and is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
