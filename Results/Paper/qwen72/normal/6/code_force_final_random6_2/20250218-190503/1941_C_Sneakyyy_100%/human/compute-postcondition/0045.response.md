Postcondition: ***`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 5. If the substring `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 3` is either 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', but the substring `s` starting at index `i-1` and ending at index `i + 2` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.***
