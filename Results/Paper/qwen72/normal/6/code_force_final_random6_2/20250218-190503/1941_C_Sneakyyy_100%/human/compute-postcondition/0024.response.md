Postcondition: ***`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string with at least 9 characters, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 1`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `i` is increased by 3 and `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1.***
