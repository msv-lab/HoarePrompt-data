Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `s` is the first 3 characters of `a` if `i` was 1, otherwise `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2. `i` must be less than `len(a) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
- If `i` was initially 1, it becomes 2, and `s` is the first 3 characters of `a`.
- If `i` was initially 3, it becomes 4, and `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index 3 and ending at index 5.
- The conditions for `ans` and `s` remain the same, but `i` is updated.
- The condition `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2` is updated to `i` must be less than `len(a) - 1` to reflect the incremented value of `i`.
