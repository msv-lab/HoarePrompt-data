Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 5, `s` is the substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 3`. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to the substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 3`.
- The initial conditions for `int(input())`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and `len(a)` remain unchanged.
- The values of `ans` and `i` are not affected by the code snippet provided, so they retain their initial values based on the condition of `s`.
