### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be removed from a string to make it beautiful by ensuring it does not contain the substrings "map" or "pie". Let's break down the logic and evaluate its correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `a`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the count of characters to be removed.
   - It uses a `while` loop to iterate through the string `a` with an index `i`.
   - For each position `i`, it checks a substring of length 3 starting from `i` (i.e., `a[i:i + 3]`).
   - If the substring is either "map" or "pie", it increments `i` by 3 and increments `ans` by 1, indicating that 3 characters are being removed.
   - If the substring is not "map" or "pie", it increments `i` by 1 to move to the next character.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which represents the minimum number of characters to be removed.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Substring Check:**
  - The program correctly identifies non-overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie" by checking substrings of length 3.
  - However, the program only increments `ans` by 1 for each occurrence, which means it is counting the number of substrings, not the number of characters. This is incorrect because removing a substring of length 3 should increment `ans` by 3.

- **Handling Overlapping Substrings:**
  - The program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the string "mmapnapie", the program will only count "map" and "pie" once each, even though "mmap" contains two overlapping "map" substrings.
  - To handle overlapping substrings, the program should increment `i` by 1 even when a "map" or "pie" is found, and continue checking the next possible substring.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of characters to be removed. It only counts the number of non-overlapping substrings, which is not the required output. Additionally, it does not handle overlapping substrings correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**
