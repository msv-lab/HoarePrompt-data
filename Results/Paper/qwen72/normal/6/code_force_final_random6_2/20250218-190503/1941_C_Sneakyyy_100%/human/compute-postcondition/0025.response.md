Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `ans` is the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, `i` is `len(a) - 2` or greater.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial conditions for `int(input())`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The string `a` is the input string and is not modified by the loop.
- The variable `ans` will be the total count of how many times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in the string `a`.
- The variable `i` will be at least `len(a) - 2` after the loop finishes. This is because the loop increments `i` by 3 whenever it finds 'map' or 'pie', and by 1 otherwise, and it stops when `i` is no longer less than `len(a) - 2`. Therefore, `i` will be at least `len(a) - 2` or greater when the loop ends.
