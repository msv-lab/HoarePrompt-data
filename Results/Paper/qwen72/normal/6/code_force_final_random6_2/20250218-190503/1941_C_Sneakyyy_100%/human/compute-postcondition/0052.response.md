Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string, `ans` is the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, and `i` is the length of `a` minus 2.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial conditions (`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, and `a` is the new input string) remain unchanged.
- The loop iterates through the string `a` in steps of 3 characters at a time, checking for the substrings 'map' or 'pie'.
- For each occurrence of 'map' or 'pie', the variable `ans` is incremented by 1.
- The loop continues until `i` is no longer less than `len(a) - 2`.
- After the loop finishes, `ans` will hold the total number of times 'map' or 'pie' appears in the string `a`.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 2`, which is the point where the loop condition `i < len(a) - 2` is no longer satisfied.
