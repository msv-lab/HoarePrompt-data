Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `T` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is not equal to `b`, `a` is not equal to 1, `b` is not equal to 1, `a` is even, and `a` is greater than `b`. Additionally, either `a` is not even, or `b` is not odd.**
