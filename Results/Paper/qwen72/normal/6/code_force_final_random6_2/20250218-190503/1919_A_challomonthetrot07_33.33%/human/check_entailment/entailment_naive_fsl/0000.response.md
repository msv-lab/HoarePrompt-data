Correctness: **False**.

Explanation of the incorrectness:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
Bob
```

Actual Output:
```
Alice
```

In this case, both Alice and Bob start with 2 coins. If both play optimally, the game will proceed as follows:

1. Alice's turn:
   - Alice can choose to swap wallets or keep her current wallet.
   - If Alice swaps, the state becomes (2, 2) again.
   - If Alice keeps her wallet, she removes 1 coin, and the state becomes (1, 2).

2. Bob's turn:
   - Bob can choose to swap wallets or keep his current wallet.
   - If Bob swaps, the state becomes (2, 1).
   - If Bob keeps his wallet, he removes 1 coin, and the state becomes (1, 1).

3. Alice's turn:
   - Alice can choose to swap wallets or keep her current wallet.
   - If Alice swaps, the state becomes (1, 1).
   - If Alice keeps her wallet, she removes 1 coin, and the state becomes (0, 1).

4. Bob's turn:
   - Bob can choose to swap wallets or keep his current wallet.
   - If Bob swaps, the state becomes (1, 0).
   - If Bob keeps his wallet, he removes 1 coin, and the state becomes (0, 0).

5. Alice's turn:
   - Alice cannot make a valid move because her wallet is empty.
   - Bob wins.

The program incorrectly outputs "Alice" for this case, which should be "Bob". Therefore, the program is incorrect.
