Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `T` from user input, indicating the number of test cases to process. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from user input. It then prints the name 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the following conditions: if `a` equals `b`, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is 1, it prints 'Alice'; if `b` is 1, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is odd, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is even and `b` is odd, it prints 'Alice'; if `a` is greater than `b`, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state is that `T` iterations have been completed, with each iteration printing a result based on the provided `a` and `b` values. **
