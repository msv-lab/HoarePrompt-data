The given code snippet is:
```
print('Alice')
```

The initial state provides a detailed set of conditions for the variables `t`, `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet will be:
Output: **Alice**
