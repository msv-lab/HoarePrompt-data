Output State: **`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements at the start of `onum` that are equal, if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is `cn + ck`, `r` is `t - 1`, `t` must be greater than `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

The code snippet `num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `num`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
