The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop condition to hold.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, and `j` is 1.**
