Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `r` is 1.
3. `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
4. `num` is a list of integers derived from the input.
5. `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n - 2`.
6. `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`.
7. `symb1` is the first element of `num`.
8. `symb2` is the last element of `num`.
9. `i` is the index where `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]` and the loop breaks, or `i` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking.
10. `ii` is the index where `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]` and the loop breaks, or `ii` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking.
11. `cn` is `cn + ck` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, and `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `onum` that are equal.
12. `f` is 0 if any two consecutive elements in `num` are not equal, otherwise `f` is 1.
13. Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `f` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
1. The code snippet simply prints the integer `0`.
2. The initial state provides a lot of information about various variables and lists, but none of these variables or lists are used in the `print` statement.
3. The value `0` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the integer `0`, regardless of the values of the variables and lists described in the initial state.

Output: **0**
