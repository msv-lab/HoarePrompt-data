Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print(n - max(cn, ck))` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `r` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `f` is 1.
- `num` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n - 2`.
- `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`.
- `symb1` is the first element of `num`.
- `symb2` is the last element of `num`.
- `i` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index where `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]` and the loop breaks.
- `ii` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `ii` is the index where `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]` and the loop breaks.
- `cn` is `cn + ck` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, and `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `onum` that are equal.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `j` and `i`**:
   - `j` is the index where the first pair of consecutive elements in `num` are not equal. If all elements are equal, `j` is `n - 2`.
   - `i` is the index where the first pair of consecutive elements in `num` are not equal, similar to `j`.

2. **Understanding `ii`**:
   - `ii` is the index where the first pair of consecutive elements in `onum` (the reversed `num`) are not equal. If all elements are equal, `ii` is `n - 2`.

3. **Understanding `symb1` and `symb2`**:
   - `symb1` is the first element of `num`.
   - `symb2` is the last element of `num`.

4. **Understanding `ck`**:
   - `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `onum` that are equal. This means it counts the number of elements from the end of `num` that are equal.

5. **Understanding `cn`**:
   - `cn` is `cn + ck` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`. Initially, `cn` is not defined, so it is assumed to be 0.

6. **Final Calculation**:
   - The `print(n - max(cn, ck))` statement will print the value of `n` minus the maximum of `cn` and `ck`.

### Detailed Calculation:
- **If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`**:
  - `cn` will be updated to `cn + ck`.
  - The value of `max(cn, ck)` will be `cn` because `cn` is now `ck + ck`.

- **If `symb1` is not equal to `symb2`**:
  - `cn` remains 0.
  - The value of `max(cn, ck)` will be `ck`.

### Final Output:
- The output will be `n - max(cn, ck)`, where:
  - `n` is the length of the list `num`.
  - `max(cn, ck)` is the maximum of `cn` and `ck`.

### Conclusion:
- If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, the output will be `n - (ck + ck)`.
- If `symb1` is not equal to `symb2`, the output will be `n - ck`.

Output: **n - max(cn, ck) (where n is the length of the list num, cn is 0 if symb1 is not equal to symb2, otherwise cn is ck + ck, and ck is the number of consecutive elements from the start of onum that are equal)**
