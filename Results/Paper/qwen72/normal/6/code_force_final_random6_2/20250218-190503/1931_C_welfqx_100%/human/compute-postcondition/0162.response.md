The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 to ensure `i` is less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented to 1.
- `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`onum` is reversed, `onum` is a copy of `num` but in reverse order, `ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is 1, `r` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `j` is the index where the first inequality was found, `symb1` is the first character of `num`, `symb2` is the first character of `onum`, `i` is 1. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is 2. Otherwise, `cn` remains 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
