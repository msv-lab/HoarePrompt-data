Output State: **`f` is 0, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is 2, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is the index where `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]` and the loop breaks, or `i` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, `ii` is the index where `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]` and the loop breaks, or `ii` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, `cn` is `cn + ck` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, and `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `onum` that are equal. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
