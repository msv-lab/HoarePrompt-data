To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions that need to be met for the loop to start and potentially run through all iterations.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
```
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 and will iterate from 0 to `n - 2` (inclusive).
- The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

### State Before the Loop
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `r` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `f` is 1.
- `num` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` and the loop breaks.
- `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`.
- `cn` is 1.
- `ck` is 1.
- `symb1` is the first element of `num`.
- `symb2` is the last element of `num`.

### Adjustments Needed
- The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.
- The loop variable `i` should be initialized to 0.

### Final State
The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` and the loop breaks, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 0**
