Output State: **`onum` is reversed, `onum` is a copy of `num` but in reverse order, `ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements at the start of `onum` that are equal, `cn` is `cn + ck` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `r` is `t - 1`, `t` must be greater than `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is 0 if any two consecutive elements in `num` are not equal, otherwise `f` is 1, `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where the first inequality was found. If `n` is 1 or `f` is 1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
