Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` and the loop breaks, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
        cn += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` and the loop breaks, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 0. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is 2. Otherwise, `cn` is 1 and the loop breaks.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` and the loop breaks, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 1. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is incremented by 1 (resulting in `cn` being 2 or 3 depending on the initial value of `cn`). Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 2. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is incremented by 1 (resulting in `cn` being 2 or 3 depending on the initial value of `cn`). Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
