Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1 if all elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` and the loop breaks, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`.**

Explanation:
- The `reverse()` method is called on `onum`, which reverses the order of the elements in the list `onum`.
- All other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `f`, `num`, `j`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state specifies that `onum` is a copy of `num`, so after reversing, `onum` will contain the elements of `num` in reverse order.
