Output State: **`i` is `d + k + 4`, `row` is a list with at least `d + k + 1` elements, `d` remains unchanged, `min_heap` is a heapified list of tuples containing elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`, but with the first `k + 1` elements removed and `e` and `(row[i], i)` pushed back into the heap, and the first element of `min_heap` must have an index less than or equal to `k + 2`. The value of `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`. The tuple `e` and the new tuple `(row[i], i)` are now included in `min_heap` and the heap is re-heapified.**

In natural language, the output state is:
- `i` remains `d + k + 4`.
- `row` is still a list with at least `d + k + 1` elements.
- `d` remains unchanged.
- `min_heap` is still a heapified list of tuples containing elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`, but with the first `k + 1` elements removed. The tuple `e` and the new tuple `(row[i], i)` have been pushed back into the heap, and the heap is re-heapified.
- The value of `row[i]` has been updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.
- The first element of `min_heap` must have an index less than or equal to `k + 2`.
