You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

    #State: The loop will have finished executing, and the final state will be as follows:
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list `row`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers where the first and last elements are 0, and a positive integer `d` such that 1 <= d < len(row). It modifies the list `row` by setting the first element to 1 and incrementing each element in the range from 1 to d-1 by 2. It then processes the list using a min-heap to update each element from index `d` to the end of the list. The function returns the last element of the modified list `row`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters, but it reads input values for n, m, k, and d, where n is the number of rows in the river grid, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges to build, and d is the maximum distance between supports. It also reads n rows of m integers each, representing the depths of the river cells. The values are such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m, with the first and last columns having a depth of 0.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))

    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `len(costs) - k`, and `total_costs` is a list containing the sums of every contiguous subsequence of length `k` in `costs`.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where min(total_costs) is the minimum sum of any contiguous subsequence of length k in the costs list)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and a grid of river depths. It calculates the minimum total depth of the river cells that need to be bridged to build `k` bridges, ensuring the distance between any two supports does not exceed `d`. The function then prints this minimum total depth.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a flaw in the implementation of `func_1`. Specifically, the way the minimum heap is managed and the way the costs are calculated for each cell does not correctly handle the condition that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. The issue arises from the incorrect handling of the heap and the calculation of the cost for each cell.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 1 0 1 0
0 2 0 2 0
0 3 0 3 0
```
For this input, the correct output should be `4` because the minimum cost to build a bridge with the maximum distance `d = 2` between supports is to build it on the first row, where the cost is `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`.

However, the program will incorrectly calculate the cost for the first row as follows:
1. Initialize the first `d` elements: `row = [1, 3, 1, 1, 1]`.
2. For `i = 3` (the fourth element), the heap will contain `[(1, 0), (3, 1), (1, 2)]`.
3. The program will pop the minimum element `(1, 0)` and add `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` to the fourth element, resulting in `row = [1, 3, 1, 3, 1]`.
4. For `i = 4` (the fifth element), the heap will contain `[(3, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3)]`.
5. The program will pop the minimum element `(1, 2)` and add `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` to the fifth element, resulting in `row = [1, 3, 1, 3, 3]`.

The final cost for the first row is `3`, which is incorrect. The correct cost should be `4`.

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the condition that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
