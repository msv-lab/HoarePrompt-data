The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `costs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `costs` and the value of `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` must be greater than `k - 1` (this is not directly relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `i` is 0.
- `total_costs` is a list that now includes the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1.
- The loop condition `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)` must still hold true, so `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than `k - 1`, `i` is 1, `total_costs` is a list that now includes the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 1**
