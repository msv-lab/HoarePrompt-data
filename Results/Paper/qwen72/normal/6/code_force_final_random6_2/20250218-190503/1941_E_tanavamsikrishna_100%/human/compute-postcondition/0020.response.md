Output State: **The loop will terminate when the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is no longer met. After all iterations, `i` will be `d + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop executed, and `min_heap` will be a heapified list of tuples containing the elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`, but with the first `k` elements removed and `e` pushed back into the heap. The value of `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`. The values of `row` and `d` remain unchanged. The tuple `(row[i], i)` is pushed into `min_heap`.**

Explanation:
- The tuple `(row[i], i)` is pushed into `min_heap`, which means `min_heap` now includes this new tuple.
- The values of `row` and `d` remain unchanged.
- The loop termination condition and the state of `i` and `min_heap` after the loop remain as described in the initial state.
- The value of `row[i]` is still updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1` as described in the initial state.
