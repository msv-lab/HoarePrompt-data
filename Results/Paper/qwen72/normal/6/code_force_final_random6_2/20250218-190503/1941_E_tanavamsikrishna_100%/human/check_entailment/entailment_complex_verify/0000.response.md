Reasoning:

Let's carefully examine the original assessment and the annotated code to determine if the program is correct or incorrect.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because the minimum heap management and cost calculation in `func_1` do not correctly handle the condition that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `row` in `func_1`:**
   - `row[0] = 1`: This sets the cost of the first support to 1.
   - `for i in range(1, d): row[i] = row[i] + 2`: This increments the cost of the first `d-1` cells by 2, which is correct because each support in these cells costs `a_{i,j} + 1` and the initial depth is `a_{i,j}`.

2. **Heap Management:**
   - `min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]`: This initializes a min-heap with the first `d` elements of the row.
   - `heapify(min_heap)`: This converts the list into a heap.
   - `for i in range(d, len(row))`: This loop processes each cell from index `d` to the end of the row.
   - `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`: This loop removes elements from the heap that are too far away to be considered for the current cell. The condition `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)` ensures that the distance between the current cell and the cell represented by `e` is more than `d`.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1`: This updates the cost of the current cell by adding the cost of the minimum support found in the heap plus 1 (the cost of installing a support in the current cell).
   - `heappush(min_heap, e)`: This reinserts the minimum support back into the heap.
   - `heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))`: This inserts the current cell into the heap.

### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 1 0 1 0
0 2 0 2 0
0 3 0 3 0
```

#### Step-by-Step Execution:
1. **First Row:**
   - Initial `row = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`
   - After initialization: `row = [1, 3, 1, 1, 1]`
   - For `i = 3` (fourth element):
     - Heap: `[(1, 0), (3, 1), (1, 2)]`
     - Minimum element: `(1, 0)`
     - New cost: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
     - Updated `row = [1, 3, 1, 3, 1]`
   - For `i = 4` (fifth element):
     - Heap: `[(3, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3)]`
     - Minimum element: `(1, 2)`
     - New cost: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
     - Updated `row = [1, 3, 1, 3, 3]`
   - Final cost for the first row: `3`

2. **Second Row:**
   - Initial `row = [0, 2, 0, 2, 0]`
   - After initialization: `row = [1, 4, 1, 1, 1]`
   - For `i = 3` (fourth element):
     - Heap: `[(1, 0), (4, 1), (1, 2)]`
     - Minimum element: `(1, 0)`
     - New cost: `1 + 2 + 1 = 4`
     - Updated `row = [1, 4, 1, 4, 1]`
   - For `i = 4` (fifth element):
     - Heap: `[(4, 1), (1, 2), (4, 3)]`
     - Minimum element: `(1, 2)`
     - New cost: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
     - Updated `row = [1, 4, 1, 4, 3]`
   - Final cost for the second row: `3`

3. **Third Row:**
   - Initial `row = [0, 3, 0, 3, 0]`
   - After initialization: `row = [1, 5, 1, 1, 1]`
   - For `i = 3` (fourth element):
     - Heap: `[(1, 0), (5, 1), (1, 2)]`
     - Minimum element: `(1, 0)`
     - New cost: `1 + 3 + 1 = 5`
     - Updated `row = [1, 5, 1, 5, 1]`
   - For `i = 4` (fifth element):
     - Heap: `[(5, 1), (1, 2), (5, 3)]`
     - Minimum element: `(1, 2)`
     - New cost: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
     - Updated `row = [1, 5, 1, 5, 3]`
   - Final cost for the third row: `3`

#### Total Cost Calculation:
- `costs = [3, 3, 3]`
- `total_costs = [3]` (since `k = 1`)

The program will print `3`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `4` for the first row.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the condition that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. The example provided in the original assessment demonstrates this flaw.

Final: **False**
