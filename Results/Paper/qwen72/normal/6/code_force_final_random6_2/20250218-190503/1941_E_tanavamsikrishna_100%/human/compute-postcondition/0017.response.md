Output State: **The loop will terminate when the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is no longer met. After all iterations, `i` will be `d + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop executed, and `min_heap` will be a heapified list of tuples containing the elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`, but with the first `k` elements removed. The values of `row` and `d` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop will continue to execute until it can no longer pop elements from `min_heap` that satisfy the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.
- After the loop finishes, `i` will be incremented by the number of times the loop executed (`k`).
- The `min_heap` will have the first `k` elements removed, but it will still be a heapified list of tuples containing the remaining elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`.
- The list `row` and the integer `d` will remain unchanged from their initial states.
