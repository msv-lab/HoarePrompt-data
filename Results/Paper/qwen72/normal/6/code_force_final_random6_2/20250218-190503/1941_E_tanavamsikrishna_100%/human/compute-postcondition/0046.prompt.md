You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of non-negative integers where row[0] = row[-1] = 0, and d is a positive integer such that 1 <= d < len(row).
def func_1(row, d):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2
        
    #State: `row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0] = 1`, `row[-1] = 0`, and for each index `i` in the range `1` to `d-1`, `row[i]` is `row[i] + 2 * (d-1)`. `d` remains a positive integer such that `1 <= d < len(row)`, and `i` is `d-1`.
    min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
            pass
        
        row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
        
        heappush(min_heap, e)
        
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
        
    #State: The loop will have finished executing, and the final state will be as follows:
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list `row`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers where the first and last elements are 0, and a positive integer `d` such that 1 <= d < len(row). It returns the last element of the list `row`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the last element of the list `row`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
