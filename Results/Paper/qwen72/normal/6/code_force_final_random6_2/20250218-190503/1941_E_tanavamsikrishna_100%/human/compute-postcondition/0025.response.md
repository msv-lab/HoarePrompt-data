Output State: **`i` is `d + k + 3`, `row` is a list with at least `d + k + 1` elements, `d` remains unchanged, `min_heap` must contain at least one tuple with an index less than or equal to `k + 1`.**

The `pass` statement does not change any variables or state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
