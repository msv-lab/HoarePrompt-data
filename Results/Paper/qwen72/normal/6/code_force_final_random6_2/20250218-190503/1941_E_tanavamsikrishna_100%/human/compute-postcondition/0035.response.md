To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head condition:

```python
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - `e`: This is the result of `heappop(min_heap)`, which is a tuple containing an element and its index.
   - `min_heap`: This is a heapified list of tuples.
   - `i`: This is the index of the current element in `row`.
   - `d`: This is a constant that remains unchanged.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the index of the element popped from `min_heap` (`e[1]`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

3. **Current State:**
   - `i` is `d + k + 4`.
   - `row` is a list with at least `d + k + 1` elements.
   - `d` remains unchanged.
   - `min_heap` is a heapified list of tuples containing elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`, but with the first `k + 1` elements removed and `e` and `(row[i], i)` pushed back into the heap.
   - The first element of `min_heap` must have an index less than or equal to `k + 2`.
   - The value of `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` must be true.
   - Given `i` is `d + k + 4`, the condition becomes `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= (d + k + 4) - (d + 2)`.
   - Simplifying the right-hand side: `(d + k + 4) - (d + 2) = k + 2`.
   - Therefore, the condition is `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= k + 2`.

5. **Current State of `min_heap`:**
   - The first element of `min_heap` must have an index less than or equal to `k + 2`.

### Conclusion:
- The current state already satisfies the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= k + 2` because the first element of `min_heap` must have an index less than or equal to `k + 2`.
- Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `d + k + 4`, `row` is a list with at least `d + k + 1` elements, `d` remains unchanged, `min_heap` is a heapified list of tuples containing elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`, but with the first `k + 1` elements removed and `e` and `(row[i], i)` pushed back into the heap, and the first element of `min_heap` must have an index less than or equal to `k + 2`. The value of `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.**
