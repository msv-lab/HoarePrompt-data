You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
   - Each row must have supports installed at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed d.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell (i, j) is \(a_{i,j} + 1\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(row, d)`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - It initializes the cost for the first column to 1 (since \(a_{i,1} = 0\), the cost is \(0 + 1 = 1\)).
   - It then iterates through the first d columns, setting the cost to \(a_{i,j} + 2\) (since the first column already has a support, the cost for the next d columns is \(a_{i,j} + 1 + 1 = a_{i,j} + 2\)).
   - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports within the sliding window of size d.
   - For each cell from column d to the last column, it ensures that the distance between supports does not exceed d by removing elements from the heap that are too far away.
   - It then adds the minimum cost from the heap to the current cell's cost and pushes the updated cost back into the heap.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the last column, which is the total cost for the row.

3. **Function 2: `func_2()`**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input values for n, m, k, and d.
   - It reads the grid of depths for n rows.
   - It calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1(row, d)`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building k consecutive bridges by summing the costs of k consecutive rows.
   - It prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of k consecutive rows.

4. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input is read using `input().split(' ')` and converted to integers.
   - The output is printed using `print(min(total_costs))`.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The function handles the constraints \(1 \le k \le n \le 100\) and \(3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The function ensures that the first and last columns have supports by setting their costs appropriately.
   - The function uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost within the sliding window of size d.

6. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - The time complexity of `func_1` is \(O(m \log d)\) due to the heap operations.
   - The time complexity of `func_2` is \(O(n \cdot m \log d)\) for processing all rows and finding the minimum total cost for k consecutive rows.
   - The space complexity is \(O(m)\) for the heap and the row costs.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid. The use of a min-heap ensures efficient handling of the sliding window constraint, and the overall structure of the program aligns with the problem requirements.
