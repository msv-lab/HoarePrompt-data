To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned values from the input with the constraints:
  - 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100
  - 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5
  - 1 ≤ d ≤ m
  - The first and last columns have a depth of 0.
- `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers representing the depths of the river grid.
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`.
- `total_costs` is an empty list.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is greater than 0.
- This means `len(costs) > k - 1`.
- Since `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `len(costs) = n`.
- Therefore, the loop will execute if `n > k - 1`.

### Adjustments:
- The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `costs`.
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `k - 1`.
- The variable `i` should start from 0.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than `k - 1`, `i` is 0**
