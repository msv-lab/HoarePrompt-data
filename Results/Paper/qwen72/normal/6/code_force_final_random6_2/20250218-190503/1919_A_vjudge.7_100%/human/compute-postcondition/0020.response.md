Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `test` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user input, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'. If the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'. The function does not return any values. After the function concludes, the state includes the number of test cases processed and the results printed for each test case. **
