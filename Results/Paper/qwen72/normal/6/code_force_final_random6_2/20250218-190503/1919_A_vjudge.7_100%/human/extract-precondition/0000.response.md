Precondition: **The function should take two integers a and b as input, where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.** 

However, the provided function definition is incorrect. It should be:

```python
def func(a, b):
```

This ensures that the function can accept the necessary input parameters to solve the problem.
