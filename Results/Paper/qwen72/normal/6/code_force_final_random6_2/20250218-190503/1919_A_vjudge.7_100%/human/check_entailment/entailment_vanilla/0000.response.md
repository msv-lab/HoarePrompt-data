### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can choose to either swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet.
   - After making the choice, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet is empty) loses the game.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins in both wallets combined.
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win. This is because Alice will always be the one to make the first move, and if the total number of coins is even, Bob will always have the last move.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win. This is because Alice will have the last move, and Bob will be the one who cannot make a valid move when the total number of coins is odd.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It then checks the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets using the bitwise AND operator (`&`).
   - If the sum is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Bitwise AND Operator:**
   - The expression `a + b & 1` is used to check the parity of the sum.
   - `a + b` gives the total number of coins.
   - `a + b & 1` checks if the least significant bit of the sum is 0 (even) or 1 (odd).
   - If the result is 0, the sum is even, and Bob wins.
   - If the result is 1, the sum is odd, and Alice wins.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where both wallets have 1 coin each, which is correctly identified as a win for Bob.
   - It also handles cases where the total number of coins is large (up to \(10^9\)), which is within the constraints.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
   - The logic is sound and matches the optimal play strategy.
