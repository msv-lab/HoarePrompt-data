Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program contains a logical error in the condition used to determine the winner. Specifically, the condition `if a + b & 1 == 0:` is incorrect. The bitwise AND operator `&` has higher precedence than the equality operator `==`, so the expression `a + b & 1 == 0` is evaluated as `(a + (b & 1)) == 0`, which is not the intended logic.

The correct condition should be `if (a + b) % 2 == 0:` to check if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins. This is because the game essentially reduces to a parity problem where the player who starts with an odd number of total coins will always win if both players play optimally.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:
```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

Case where the program fails:
For the input:
```
1
1 1
```
The program will incorrectly output `Alice` instead of `Bob` because `1 + 1 & 1 == 0` evaluates to `True`, which is incorrect. The correct condition should be `(1 + 1) % 2 == 0`, which evaluates to `True`, and thus the correct output should be `Bob`.
