#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to process a series of test cases. Each test case contains a string of length 5, composed of the characters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B}. The input starts with an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32) indicating the number of test cases, and each of the following t lines contains a distinct string.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is `t-1`, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in the last input string `s`, and `bc` is the number of non-'A' characters in the last input string `s`.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is `t-1`, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in the last input string `s`, and `bc` is the number of non-'A' characters in the last input string `s`. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, if `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`, the program executes the else part.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) indicating the number of test cases, and then reads `t` distinct strings of length 5, each composed of the characters 'A' and 'B'. For the last test case, it counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters in the string. If the number of 'A' characters is greater than the number of 'B' characters, it prints 'A'. Otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value.
