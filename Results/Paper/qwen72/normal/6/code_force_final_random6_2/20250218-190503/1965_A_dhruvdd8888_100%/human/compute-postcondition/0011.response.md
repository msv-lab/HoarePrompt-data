The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `nums`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `nums`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element
- `nums[0]` is unchanged
- `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - nums[0]`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2. The length of `nums` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `t` is the length of `test_cases` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ls` is now equal to `nums[0] + nums[1] - nums[0]`, `i` is 2, `nums[0]` is unchanged, `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - nums[0]`**
