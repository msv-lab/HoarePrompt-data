Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Function Call in Main Loop**:
   - The main loop calls `func_1()` but the function `func_1` is defined after the loop. This will cause a `NameError` because the function is not defined at the time it is called.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Input**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of piles `N` and the pile sizes `nums` inside the function, but the main loop does not pass any arguments to `func_1`. This will cause the function to read input multiple times, which is not correct for the problem's input format.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The logic for determining the winner is flawed. The program adds '0' to the set of pile sizes and then sorts the set. This can lead to incorrect results because adding '0' changes the set and the sorting of the set does not necessarily reflect the original pile sizes.
   - The program then iterates through the sorted list and updates the `cw` and `nw` variables, but this logic does not correctly simulate the game described. The game involves removing stones from all nonempty piles simultaneously, and the logic here does not account for this.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if all piles have the same size, the program should return "Alice" if the size is odd and "Bob" if the size is even. The current logic does not correctly handle this.

To illustrate the incorrectness, consider the following test case:

**Test Case**:
```
1
3
1 1 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Alice
```

**Actual Output**:
The program will likely produce an incorrect output due to the issues mentioned above. The logic of adding '0' to the set and then sorting it will result in an incorrect sequence of pile sizes, leading to an incorrect determination of the winner.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
