To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the loop head and the conditions required for the loop to continue.

The loop head is:
```
for i in range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1):
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - `i`: This is the loop variable.
   - `len(nums)`: This is the length of the `nums` list.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 1 (since the loop starts at `len(nums) - 2` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 0).

### Given State:
- `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 3`.
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements.
- `len(nums) - 2` is the starting point of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Current Value of `i`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(nums) - 3`.

2. **Next Value of `i`**:
   - The loop decrements `i` by 1, so the next value of `i` will be `len(nums) - 3 - 1 = len(nums) - 4`.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - Therefore, `len(nums) - 4` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - This implies `len(nums) - 4 ≥ 1`, which simplifies to `len(nums) ≥ 5`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is now `len(nums) - 4`.
- `nums` must have at least 5 elements for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`test_cases` remains a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The length of `test_cases` is `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `N` is an input integer. `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 5 elements, and all elements modified such that each element `nums[i]` is now `nums[i] - (nums[0] + nums[1] - nums[0] + ... + nums[i-1] - (nums[i-2] + ... + nums[0]))`. `ls` is the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list. `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 4`. `cw` is `True`. `nw` is `True`.**
