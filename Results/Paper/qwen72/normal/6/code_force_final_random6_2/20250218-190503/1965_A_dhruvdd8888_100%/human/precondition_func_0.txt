test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The length of test_cases is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
