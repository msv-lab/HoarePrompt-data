To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `nums`. The loop will execute if `nums` is a non-empty list, and `i` will start from 0.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
- The length of `test_cases` is `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
- `N` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers, where each integer is the result of converting the strings in the original set `nums` to integers.
- `ls` is 0.

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `nums` is a non-empty list. Therefore, `nums` must have at least one element, and `i` must start from 0.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `t` is the length of `test_cases` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `ls` is 0, `i` is 0**
