### Reasoning

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided function summary and the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers `vals` from the user input.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Computing the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   - `den` is initialized to `vals[0]`.
   - The function `func_1` is used to compute the LCM of all elements in `vals`.
   - `func_1(a, b)` returns the LCM of `a` and `b` by using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \).
   - This is a correct implementation of the LCM function.

3. **Computing the Distribution:**
   - `vprod` is computed as a list where each element is the integer division of `den` by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - This step ensures that the product of each `vprod[i]` and `vals[i]` is equal to `den`.

4. **Checking the Condition:**
   - The sum of all elements in `vprod` is subtracted from `den` to get the final value of `den`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` and returns.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces.

### Analysis of the Original Assessment

The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same. Let's test this with the provided example:

**Example Input:**
```
2
5
5 5 5 5 5
```

**Step-by-Step Execution:**
1. `N = 5`
2. `vals = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
3. `den` is initialized to `5`.
4. The LCM of all elements in `vals` is computed:
   - `func_1(5, 5) = 5`
   - `func_1(5, 5) = 5`
   - `func_1(5, 5) = 5`
   - `func_1(5, 5) = 5`
   - `func_1(5, 5) = 5`
   - So, `den` remains `5`.

5. `vprod` is computed as:
   - `vprod = [5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

6. The sum of `vprod` is:
   - `sum(vprod) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`

7. `den` is updated to:
   - `den = 5 - 5 = 0`

8. Since `den` is 0, the function prints `-1` and returns.

### Conclusion

The program correctly identifies that there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome when all multipliers are the same. This aligns with the problem description, which states that if all multipliers are the same, the output should be `-1`.

### Final Evaluation

The original assessment was accurate. The program does not handle the case where all multipliers are the same correctly, and it outputs `-1` as expected in such cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
