### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount bet on the i-th outcome.
   - We need to find a way to distribute the coins such that the sum of all bets is less than `k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` returns the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
   - This function is used to find a common multiple of all the multipliers `k_i` in `func_2`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Input:**
     - `N` is the number of outcomes.
     - `vals` is a list of multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.
   - **Process:**
     - `den` is initialized to the first element of `vals`.
     - `den` is updated to the LCM of all elements in `vals` using `func_1`.
     - `vprod` is a list where each element is `den // k_i`.
     - `den` is then updated to `den - sum(vprod)`.
     - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and returns, indicating no valid distribution.
     - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - **LCM Calculation:**
     - The LCM of all `k_i` values ensures that `den` is a common multiple of all multipliers.
   - **Distribution Calculation:**
     - `vprod` is calculated as `den // k_i` for each `k_i`.
     - The sum of `vprod` is subtracted from `den` to check if the total bet is less than the amount received back for any outcome.
   - **Condition for Valid Distribution:**
     - If `den` is greater than 0 after the subtraction, it means the total bet is less than the amount received back for any outcome, which satisfies the problem's requirement.
     - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it means no valid distribution exists, and the function correctly prints `-1`.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For `vals = [3, 2, 7]`:
     - `den` starts as 3.
     - LCM of 3 and 2 is 6, then LCM of 6 and 7 is 42.
     - `vprod` is `[42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]`.
     - `den` is updated to `42 - (14 + 21 + 6) = 1`.
     - Since `den > 0`, the function prints `14 21 6`, which is a valid distribution.
   - For `vals = [3, 3]`:
     - `den` starts as 3.
     - LCM of 3 and 3 is 3.
     - `vprod` is `[3 // 3, 3 // 3] = [1, 1]`.
     - `den` is updated to `3 - (1 + 1) = 1`.
     - Since `den > 0`, the function prints `1 1`, which is a valid distribution.
   - For `vals = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`:
     - `den` starts as 5.
     - LCM of all 5s is 5.
     - `vprod` is `[5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
     - `den` is updated to `5 - (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 0`.
     - Since `den <= 0`, the function prints `-1`, which is correct because no valid distribution exists.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a valid distribution of coins exists and prints the appropriate output. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
