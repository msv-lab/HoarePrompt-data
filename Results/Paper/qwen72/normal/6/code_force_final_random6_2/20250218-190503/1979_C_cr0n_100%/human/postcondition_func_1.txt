The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers `vals` from the user input. It then applies a function `func_1` to all elements of `vals` sequentially, starting with `vals[0]` as the initial value, and stores the result in `den`. It computes a list `vprod` where each element is the integer division of `den` by the corresponding element in `vals`. The function then subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den`. If the resulting `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` and returns. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.
