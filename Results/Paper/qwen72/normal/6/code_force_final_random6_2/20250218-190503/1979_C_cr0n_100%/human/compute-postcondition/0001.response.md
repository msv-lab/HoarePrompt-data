Output State: **`N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, and `vals` is a list of N integers such that 2 ≤ `vals[i]` ≤ 20 for all 0 ≤ i < N.** 

The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `vals`. The length of `vals` is now equal to `N`, and each element in `vals` is an integer between 2 and 20, inclusive. The value of `N` remains unchanged.
