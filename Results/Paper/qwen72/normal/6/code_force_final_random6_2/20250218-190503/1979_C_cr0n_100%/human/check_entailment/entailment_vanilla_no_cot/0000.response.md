Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the greatest common divisor (GCD). The LCM is used to find a common multiple of all the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function processes each test case:
   - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the list of multipliers `vals`.
   - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier.
   - It iterates through the list of multipliers, updating `den` to be the LCM of `den` and the current multiplier. This ensures that `den` is a common multiple of all the multipliers.
   - It calculates the bet for each outcome as `den // r` where `r` is the multiplier for that outcome.
   - It calculates the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes and subtracts it from `den` to check if the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` indicating no valid solution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the list of bets.

The program correctly ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, which satisfies the problem's requirements. The constraints and the logic used in the program are appropriate for the given problem.
