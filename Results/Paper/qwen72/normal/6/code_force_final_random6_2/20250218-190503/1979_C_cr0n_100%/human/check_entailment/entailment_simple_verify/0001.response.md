### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`.

2. **Mathematical Approach:**
   - We need to find `x_i` such that `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.
   - This can be rewritten as `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`, which simplifies to `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.
   - To ensure this, the program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i` to find a common base for the bets.

3. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` correctly computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) // GCD(a, b)`.

4. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2()` processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
   - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier and then iteratively computes the LCM of `den` and each multiplier in `vals`.
   - After computing the LCM, it calculates the bet for each outcome as `den // k_i`.
   - It then checks if the total amount bet `sum(vprod)` is less than `den`. If not, it prints `-1`.
   - Finally, it prints the bets for each outcome.

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The LCM approach ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the total amount bet is a common multiple of the multipliers.
   - The condition `sum(x_i) < den` ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The program correctly handles the case where no valid distribution is possible by printing `-1`.

6. **Annotated Code Evaluation:**
   - The annotated code confirms that `den` is the LCM of all multipliers in `vals`.
   - The bets `vprod` are calculated as `den // k_i` for each `k_i` in `vals`.
   - The program checks if the total amount bet `sum(vprod)` is less than `den`. If it is, the program prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all multipliers are the same (e.g., `5 5 5 5 5`) by correctly printing `-1` because the total amount bet would be equal to `den`, not strictly less.
   - The program also handles the case where the multipliers are different and ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to distribute the coins as required by the problem statement. It uses the LCM to find a common base for the bets and ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The program also correctly handles cases where no valid distribution is possible by printing `-1`.

Final: **True**
