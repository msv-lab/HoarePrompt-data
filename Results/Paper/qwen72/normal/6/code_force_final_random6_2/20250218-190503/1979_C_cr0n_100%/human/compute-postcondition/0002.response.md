Output State: **`N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of N integers such that 2 ≤ `vals[i]` ≤ 20 for all 0 ≤ i < N, `den` is equal to `vals[0]`.** 

In natural language: The variable `N` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 50, and `vals` remains a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 2 and 20. The variable `den` is now assigned the value of the first element in the list `vals`.
