Output State: **`N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of N integers such that 2 ≤ `vals[i]` ≤ 20 for all 0 ≤ i < N, `den` is the result of applying `func_1` to all elements of `vals` sequentially, starting with `vals[0]` as the initial value.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `den` will hold the result of applying the function `func_1` to all the elements in the list `vals` in sequence. The initial value of `den` is `vals[0]`, and for each subsequent element in `vals`, `func_1` is applied to the current value of `den` and the next element in the list. The values of `N` and `vals` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
