Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer; `t` is `t + t2 // 15`; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`; `t2` is `a - t1` and `t2` is divisible by 15.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `t` is calculated by adding the integer division of `t2` by 15 to the original value of `t`.
- The conditions for `t1` and `t2` remain valid as they were in the initial state.
