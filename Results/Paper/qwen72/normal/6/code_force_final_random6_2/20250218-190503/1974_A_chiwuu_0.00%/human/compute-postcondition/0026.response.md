Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `a` is the integer value of the original string `a`; `b` is now an integer representing the original value of `b`; `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1` depending on whether `b * 2` is divisible by 5. If `t1` (which is `t * 15 - b * 4`) is greater than or equal to the integer value of `a`, then `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4` and is greater than or equal to the integer value of `a`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15` (or `t + t2 // 15 + 1` if `t2 % 15 != 0`), `t1` is recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than the integer value of `a`, and `t2` is `a - t1` (and is divisible by 15 if `t2 % 15 == 0`).**
