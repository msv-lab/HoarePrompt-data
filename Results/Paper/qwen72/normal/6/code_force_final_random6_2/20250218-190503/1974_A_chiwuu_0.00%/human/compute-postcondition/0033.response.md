Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `a` is the integer value of the original string `a`; `b` is now an integer representing the original value of `b`; if `t` is divisible by 5, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5`, otherwise `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t2` is `a - t1`.**

Explanation:
- `t2` is assigned the value of `a - t1`.
- `t1` is already calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged.
- The value of `t2` is now `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.
