Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer; `t` is equal to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, and `t` is not divisible by 5.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t // 5 + 1`.
- Since `t` was initially equal to `b * 2` and not divisible by 5, the new value of `t` is calculated as `b * 2 // 5 + 1`.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `t` is not divisible by 5 still holds after the update.
