Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer; `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1` depending on whether `b * 2` is divisible by 5; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t1` is less than `a`; `t2` is `a - t1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `t1`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions on `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `t`, and `t1` are still valid.
