The values of `a` and `b` are assigned based on the input provided, where `input().split()` splits the input string by spaces and assigns the first part to `a` and the second part to `b`. The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a` and `b` are strings based on the input.**
