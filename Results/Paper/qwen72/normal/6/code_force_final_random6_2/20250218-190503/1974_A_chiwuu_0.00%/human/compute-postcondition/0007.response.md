Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer; `t` is equal to `b * 2 // 5`, and `t` is divisible by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t // 5`, which means `t` is now equal to `b * 2 // 5`.
- Since `t` was initially divisible by 5, after dividing by 5, `t` will be an integer and divisible by 1.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
