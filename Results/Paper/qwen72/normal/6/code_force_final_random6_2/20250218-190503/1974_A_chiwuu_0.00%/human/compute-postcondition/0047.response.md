Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `a` is the integer value of the first part of the input string; `b` is the integer value of the second part of the input string; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` updates the value of `t1` based on the current values of `t` and `b`. The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The new value of `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
