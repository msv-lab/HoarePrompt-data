Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is an input integer; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` is the integer value of the last input string's first part; `b` is the integer value of the last input string's second part; `t` is calculated based on the last input values of `a` and `b` as follows: `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1` depending on whether `b * 2` is divisible by 5. If `t1` (which is `t * 15 - b * 4`) is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4` and is greater than or equal to `a`. Otherwise, `t2` is `a - t1`, and `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15` (or `t + t2 // 15 + 1` if `t2 % 15 != 0`).**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `n` iterations, the variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged and still satisfy the condition 0 <= x, y <= 99. The loop index `i` will be `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration. The variables `a` and `b` will hold the integer values of the last input string provided during the loop's execution. The variable `t` will be the final value calculated based on the last input values of `a` and `b` using the logic described in the loop body. Specifically, `t` is initially set to `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1` depending on whether `b * 2` is divisible by 5. If `t1` (which is `t * 15 - b * 4`) is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15` or `t + t2 // 15 + 1` if `t2 % 15 != 0`, where `t2` is `a - t1`.
