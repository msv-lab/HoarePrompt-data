The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `a` is the integer value of the original string `a`; `b` is now an integer representing the original value of `b`. If `t` is divisible by 5, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5`, otherwise `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1 >= a`, `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1 < a`, `t2` is `a - t1`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then if `t` is divisible by 5, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`, otherwise `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`. If `t2 % 15 != 0`, then if `t` is divisible by 5, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`, otherwise `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1 + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.**
