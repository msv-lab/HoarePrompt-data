Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `a` is the integer value of the original string `a`; `b` is now an integer representing the original value of `b`; if `t` is divisible by 5, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5`, otherwise `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.**
