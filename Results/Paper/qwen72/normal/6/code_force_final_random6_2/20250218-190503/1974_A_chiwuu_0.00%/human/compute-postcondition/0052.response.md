Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `a` is the integer value of the first part of the input string; `b` is the integer value of the second part of the input string; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t2` is `a - t1`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.***
