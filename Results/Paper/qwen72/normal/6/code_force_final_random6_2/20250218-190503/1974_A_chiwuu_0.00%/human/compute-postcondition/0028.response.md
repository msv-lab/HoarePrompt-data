Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `a` is the integer value of the original string `a`; `b` is now an integer representing the original value of `b`; `t` is `b * 2 // 5`.**

The value of `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5`, which means `t` is now the integer division of `b * 2` by 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
