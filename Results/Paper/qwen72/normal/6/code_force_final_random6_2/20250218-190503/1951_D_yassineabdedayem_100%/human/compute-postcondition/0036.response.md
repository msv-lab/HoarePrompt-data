Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer where \(0 < t < 1000\).
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
   - `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`.
   - If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`.
   - If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(n - k + 1, end=' ')` will print the value of the expression `n - k + 1` followed by a space.

3. **Determine the Value of `n - k + 1`:**
   - The value of `n - k + 1` depends on the values of `n` and `k` read from the input line.
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n - k + 1` simplifies to `0 + 1`, which is `1`.
   - If `n` is not equal to `k`, the value of `n - k + 1` will be the result of the arithmetic operation `n - k + 1`.

4. **Output Based on Conditions:**
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, the output will be `1`.
   - If `n` is not equal to `k`, the output will be `n - k + 1`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the conditions given.

Output: **n - k + 1 (where n and k are the first and second integers read from the input line, respectively)**
