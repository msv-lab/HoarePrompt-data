Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` is an input integer where 0 < t < 1000.
2. `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
3. `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
4. If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`.
5. If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`.
6. If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(1)
```

This statement simply prints the integer `1`. The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the value being printed by this statement. The value `1` is an explicit value and does not depend on any variables or conditions.

Output: **1**
