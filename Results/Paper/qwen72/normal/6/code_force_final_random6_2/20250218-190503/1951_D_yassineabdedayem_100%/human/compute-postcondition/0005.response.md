Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `_` is a placeholder variable (not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
   - `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
   - `n` is equal to `k`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - The `print` statement simply prints the integer `1`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, it will always print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
