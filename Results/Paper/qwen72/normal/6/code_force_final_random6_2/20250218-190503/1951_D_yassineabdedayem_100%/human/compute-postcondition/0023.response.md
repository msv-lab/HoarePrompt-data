The provided Python code snippet is:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t < 1000\).
  - `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
  - `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
  - The relationship between `n` and `k` is such that if `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and the relationship between `n + 2` and `k * 2` is such that either `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2` or `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the integer `2`.
- The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will always print the integer `2`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2**
