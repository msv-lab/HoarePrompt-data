Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer where \(0 < t < 1000\).
2. `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
3. `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
4. If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`.
5. If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`.
6. If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides conditions for the variables `n` and `k`, but it does not specify any conditions that would prevent the `print('YES')` statement from executing.
- The conditions in the initial state are:
  - `n` is equal to `k`.
  - `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`.
  - `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

- Regardless of which of these conditions is true, the code snippet will always execute the `print('YES')` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will always print the string 'YES' because the initial state does not provide any conditions that would prevent this from happening.

Output: **YES**
