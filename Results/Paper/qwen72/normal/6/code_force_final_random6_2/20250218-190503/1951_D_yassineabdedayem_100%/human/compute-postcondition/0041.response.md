Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. For each test case, if `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`. If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`. If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: After the loop completes all iterations, `t` will have been decremented to 0, but the initial condition that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000` still holds true for the context of the loop's execution.
- **`_`**: This is a placeholder variable used in the loop to iterate `t` times. It does not affect the state of other variables.
- **`n` and `k`**: These variables are read from the input for each test case. The conditions checked in the loop (`n == k`, `n + 2 > k * 2`, and `n + 2 <= k * 2`) determine the output for each test case, but they do not change the values of `n` and `k` themselves.
- **Conditions**: The conditions inside the loop (`n == k`, `n + 2 > k * 2`, and `n + 2 <= k * 2`) are checked for each test case, and the output is determined based on these conditions. The state of these conditions remains the same for each test case as they are evaluated independently for each iteration.
