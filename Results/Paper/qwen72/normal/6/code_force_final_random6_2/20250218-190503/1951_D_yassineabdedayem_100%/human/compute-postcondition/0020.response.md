Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t < 1000.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
- The relationship between `n` and `k` is such that:
  - If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`.
  - Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and the relationship between `n + 2` and `k * 2` is such that either `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2` or `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer `1`.
- The initial state provides conditions and relationships between `n` and `k`, but these conditions do not affect the value being printed by the `print` statement.
- The value `1` is a constant and does not depend on any variables or conditions.

### Output:
Output: **1**
