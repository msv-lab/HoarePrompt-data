Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where \(0 < t < 1000\).
- `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
- If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`.
- If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`.
- If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides conditions for `n` and `k`, but it does not specify any conditions that would prevent the `print('YES')` statement from executing.
- The conditions given are:
  - If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k` (this is a tautology and always true).
  - If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2` (this is also a tautology and always true if the condition is met).
  - If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2` (this is also a tautology and always true if the condition is met).

- Since the conditions are tautologies, they do not affect the execution of the `print` statement. The `print` statement will always execute and print 'YES' regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print 'YES' based on the given conditions.

Output: **YES**
