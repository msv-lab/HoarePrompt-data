Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `_` is a placeholder variable (not used in the code).
- `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'NO'`.
- The initial state provides conditions on the variables `n` and `k`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement in any way.
- The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `_`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `_`.

Output: **NO**
