Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t < 1000\).
- `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
- The relationship between `n` and `k` is such that:
  - If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`.
  - Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and the relationship between `n + 2` and `k * 2` is such that either `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2` or `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement will output the value of the expression `n - k + 1`.
- The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Determining the Output:
1. **If `n` is equal to `k`:**
   - The expression `n - k + 1` simplifies to `0 + 1`, which is `1`.
   - Therefore, the output will be `1`.

2. **If `n` is not equal to `k`:**
   - We need to consider the relationship between `n + 2` and `k * 2`:
     - **If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`:**
       - This implies `n + 2 > 2k`, which simplifies to `n > 2k - 2`.
       - The expression `n - k + 1` will be a positive integer.
     - **If `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`:**
       - This implies `n + 2 <= 2k`, which simplifies to `n <= 2k - 2`.
       - The expression `n - k + 1` can be a non-negative integer or a negative integer depending on the values of `n` and `k`.

### Conclusion:
- If `n` is equal to `k`, the output will be `1`.
- If `n` is not equal to `k`, the output will be `n - k + 1`, which can be a positive, zero, or negative integer depending on the values of `n` and `k`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 (if n is equal to k) or n - k + 1 (if n is not equal to k, where n and k are the first and second integers read from the input line, respectively)**
