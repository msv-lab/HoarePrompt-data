Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is the first integer read from the input line, `k` is the second integer read from the input line, and `n` is not equal to `k`. If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, then the current value of `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`. Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.***
