Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `_` is a placeholder variable (its value is not relevant to the problem).
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
   - `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
   - `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - The current value of `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the integer `2`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `_` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.
   - The condition `n + 2 > k * 2` is given, but it does not influence the `print` statement either.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the integer `2`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `_`.

Output: **2**
