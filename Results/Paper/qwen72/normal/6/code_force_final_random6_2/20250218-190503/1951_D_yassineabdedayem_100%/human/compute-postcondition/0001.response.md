For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that the conditions in the loop head are met. In this case, the loop head is:

```
for _ in range(t):
```

The only variable in the loop head is `t`, and the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted since it is not used to control the loop. 

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18

Since `t` is already guaranteed to be within the range 1 to 1000, it is already greater than 0, which means the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is a placeholder variable**
