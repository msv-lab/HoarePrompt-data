Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is a placeholder variable.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
- `n` is equal to `k`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions provided in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
