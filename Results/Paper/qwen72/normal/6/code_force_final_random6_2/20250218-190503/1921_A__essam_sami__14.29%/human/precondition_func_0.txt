The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates are within the range -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and the square has a positive area. The function should return a list of areas for each test case.
