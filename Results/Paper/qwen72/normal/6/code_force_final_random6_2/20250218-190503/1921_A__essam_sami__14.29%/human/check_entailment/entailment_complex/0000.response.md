### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case. For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates.

2. **Coordinate Differences**: The function calculates two squared distances:
   - `n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`
   - `x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`

   These calculations are intended to find the squared distances between two pairs of points. However, the function does not correctly identify the side length of the square. The side length of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes should be the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners.

3. **Comparison and Output**: The function compares the two squared distances `n` and `x` and prints the smaller one. This is incorrect because the side length of the square should be consistent across all pairs of adjacent corners, and the area should be the square of this side length.

4. **Correct Approach**: To correctly solve the problem, the function should:
   - Identify the side length of the square by finding the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners.
   - Calculate the area as the square of this side length.
   - Print the area for each test case.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. It calculates the squared distances between arbitrary pairs of points and prints the smaller one, which is not the correct approach for finding the area of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
