You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates are within the range -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and the square has a positive area. The function should return a list of areas for each test case.

    #State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `steps` is `t - 1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are the last set of integers provided by the user input, `n` is equal to (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f), and `x` is equal to (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h). If `x` > `n`, the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square for all potential cases. Specifically, the program calculates the distance between two pairs of points and then prints the smaller of the two distances squared. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the points used to calculate the distance are actually the sides of the square.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
0 0
0 2
2 0
2 2
```
The correct area of the square is 4, but the program will calculate:
- `n = (0 - 2) * (0 - 2) + (0 - 0) * (0 - 0) = 4`
- `x = (0 - 2) * (0 - 2) + (2 - 2) * (2 - 2) = 4`

Since `n` and `x` are equal, the program will print `4`, which is correct in this case. However, the logic is not robust and can fail in other cases. For instance, if the points are given in a different order:
```
1
0 0
2 2
0 2
2 0
```
The program will calculate:
- `n = (0 - 0) * (0 - 0) + (0 - 2) * (0 - 2) = 4`
- `x = (2 - 2) * (2 - 2) + (2 - 0) * (2 - 0) = 4`

Again, the program will print `4`, but the logic is still flawed. The correct approach should involve identifying the side length of the square by finding the minimum distance between the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the given points and then squaring that distance.

A correct implementation would be:
```python
def find_square_area():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract x and y coordinates
        x_coords = [point[0] for point in points]
        y_coords = [point[1] for point in points]
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length_x = max(x_coords) - min(x_coords)
        side_length_y = max(y_coords) - min(y_coords)
        
        # The side length should be the same for both x and y
        if side_length_x != side_length_y:
            print("Error: Points do not form a square")
        else:
            print(side_length_x * side_length_x)
```

This implementation correctly identifies the side length of the square by finding the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates and ensures that the side lengths are equal, which is a necessary condition for the points to form a square.
