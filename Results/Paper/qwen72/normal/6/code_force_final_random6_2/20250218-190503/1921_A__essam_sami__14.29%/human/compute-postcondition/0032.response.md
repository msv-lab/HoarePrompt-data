Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 2, `steps` is 2, `c` and `d` are new integers provided by the user input, `e` and `f` are new integers provided by the user input, `g` and `h` are new integers provided by the user input, `n` is equal to (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f), `x` is equal to (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h). If `x` > `n`, the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `n` and `a` and `b` are updated to new integers provided by the user input. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `a` and `b` are updated to new integers provided by the user input.***
