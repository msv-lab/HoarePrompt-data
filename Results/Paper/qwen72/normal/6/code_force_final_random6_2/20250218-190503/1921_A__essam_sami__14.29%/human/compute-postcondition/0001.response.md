To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variables `steps` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer, and the function should accept a list of test cases. However, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `steps` should start at 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 0**
