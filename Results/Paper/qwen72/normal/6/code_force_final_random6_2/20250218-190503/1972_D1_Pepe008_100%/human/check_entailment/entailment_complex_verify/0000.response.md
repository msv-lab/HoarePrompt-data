### Reasoning:

Let's break down the original assessment and the annotated code to understand the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect for the following reasons:
1. The formula used to calculate \(x\) is not derived correctly from the problem's conditions.
2. The condition `if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is not necessary and does not correctly handle the problem's requirements.
3. The final result `suma - 2` is incorrect and does not account for all valid pairs.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `suma` to 0.
   - It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
   - If \(x\) is greater than 0, it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - If both \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\), it increments `suma` by 1.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints `suma - 2` for each test case.

#### Evaluation of the Formula and Logic:
- **Formula for \(x\):**
  - The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is not derived from the problem's conditions. The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), not some arbitrary formula involving \(i\).
  - The condition \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) does not correctly represent the problem's requirements. Specifically, \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) is always false for \(i > 1\) because \(i \cdot (i - 1)\) is not divisible by \(i^2\) when \(i > 1\).

- **Final Result:**
  - The final result `suma - 2` is incorrect. There is no justification for subtracting 2 from the sum of valid pairs.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. For each pair, compute \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs and print the result for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not correctly solve the problem due to the incorrect formula and logic used to determine the number of valid pairs. The final result `suma - 2` is also incorrect.

Final: **False**
