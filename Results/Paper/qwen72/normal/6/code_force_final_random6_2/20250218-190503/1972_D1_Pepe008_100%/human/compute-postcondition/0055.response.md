Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings from user input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to `a`, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is the sum of \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for all \(i\) from 1 to `b` where \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\), and if \((a - i \times (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \((i \times (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\), then `suma` is incremented by 1 for each such \(i\)**

The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integer values of `info[0]` and `info[1]`, respectively. The conditions that `b` must be greater than or equal to `a` and that `i` is `b + 1` remain valid. The calculation for `suma` is based on the new values of `a` and `b`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
