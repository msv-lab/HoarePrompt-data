Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to `a`, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is the sum of \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for all \(i\) from 1 to `b` where \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\), and if \((a - i \times (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \((i \times (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\), then `suma` is incremented by 1 for each such \(i\).**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variables `n`, `m`, `T`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
- The variable `a` remains the integer value of `info[0]`.
- The variable `b` remains the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to `a`.
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = b`.
- For each iteration, the variable `x` is calculated as \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
- If `x` is greater than 0, `suma` is incremented by `x`.
- Additionally, if both \((a - i \times (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \((i \times (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\), `suma` is incremented by 1.
- After all iterations, `i` is `b + 1` because the loop has completed its range.
- The final value of `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values and any additional increments due to the conditions mentioned above.
