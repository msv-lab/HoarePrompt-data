Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the program's logic and implementation do not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The program uses the formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) to calculate the number of valid pairs. This formula does not directly relate to the problem's condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\) should be checked directly, but the program does not do this.

2. **Incorrect Incrementing of `suma`**:
   - The program increments `suma` by `x` and then by 1 under certain conditions. However, these conditions are not aligned with the problem's requirements.
   - The condition \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i ** 2 == 0\) are not relevant to the problem's condition.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The program prints `suma - 2`, which is not the correct way to output the number of valid pairs. The subtraction of 2 is not justified by the problem's conditions.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
