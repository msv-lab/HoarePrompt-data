The only objects in the loop head are the variables `t` and `T`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t` and `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1 and `T` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `t` is incremented by 1, so `t` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `T` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to `a`, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is the sum of \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for all \(i\) from 1 to `b` where \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\), and if \((a - i \times (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \((i \times (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\), then `suma` is incremented by 1 for each such \(i\)**.
