### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), we can rewrite the condition as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer \(k\).
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\).
   - Substituting these into the equation:
     \[
     d \cdot a' + d \cdot b' = k \cdot d \cdot b' \cdot d
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     a' + b' = k \cdot d \cdot b'
     \]
     \[
     a' = b' \cdot (k \cdot d - 1)
     \]
   - For \(a'\) to be an integer, \(b' \cdot (k \cdot d - 1)\) must be an integer. Since \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\), \(b'\) must be 1. Therefore:
     \[
     a' = k \cdot d - 1
     \]
   - This means \(a = d \cdot (k \cdot d - 1)\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values using the formula:
     \[
     x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - This formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be:
     \[
     a = i \cdot (k \cdot i - 1)
     \]
     where \(k\) is an integer such that \(a \le n\).
   - The program incorrectly adds 1 to \(x\) and then checks for additional conditions that are not necessary.
   - The final subtraction of 2 is also incorrect and not justified by the problem statement.

4. **Annotated Code Evaluation:**
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - The formula \(x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\) is derived from an incorrect understanding of the problem.
   - The condition \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \mod i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \mod i^2 == 0\) is not necessary for the problem and is incorrect.
   - The final subtraction of 2 is not justified and does not align with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic for calculating the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) is flawed, and the final result is incorrect.

Final: **False**
