Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to `a`, `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values and additional 1s for each valid `i` that meets the specific conditions, `i` is `b + 1`, `info` is a list of strings from the new input.**

Explanation:
- The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integer values of `info[0]` and `info[1]` respectively.
- The conditions that `a` and `b` must be integers and `b` must be greater than or equal to `a` are still valid.
- The other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `suma`, `i`, `info`) remain unchanged.
