Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to `a` and 2, `suma` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is \((a - 2 \times 1) // 4 + 1\)**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to \((a - 2 \times 1) // 4 + 1\).
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `suma`, `i`) remain unchanged.
