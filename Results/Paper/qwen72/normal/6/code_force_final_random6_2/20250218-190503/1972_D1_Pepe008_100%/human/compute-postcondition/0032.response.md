Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to `a` and 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is `(a + 1) // 1`**

Explanation: 
- The value of `x` is calculated using the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
- Given that `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1`, which further simplifies to `(a - 0) // 1 + 1`, and finally to `a + 1`.
- Therefore, `x` is assigned the value `a + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `suma`, `i`, and `info`) remain unchanged.
