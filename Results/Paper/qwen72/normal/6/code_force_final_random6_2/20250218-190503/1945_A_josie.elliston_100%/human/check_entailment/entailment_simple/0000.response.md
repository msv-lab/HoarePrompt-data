### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate extroverts and universals.
   - The function checks if the number of extroverts is divisible by 3. If not, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) can be paired with universals to form complete tents.
   - If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts to form a complete tent, so the function returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of extroverts and universals by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all extroverts and universals.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` is the main function that processes the input and calls `func_1`.
   - It first calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals as per the rules, so `func_2` returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the value returned by `func_1`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Case 1:** When `extroverts % 3 == 0`, the function `func_1` will return the number of tents required to accommodate all extroverts and universals, which is correct.
   - **Case 2:** When `extroverts % 3 != 0` and `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, the function `func_1` correctly returns `None`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals.
   - **Case 3:** When `extroverts % 3 != 0` and `extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3`, the function `func_1` correctly returns the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all extroverts and universals.

4. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem.
   - It ensures that introverts are always accommodated in separate tents.
   - It checks if it is possible to accommodate extroverts and universals according to their preferences and returns the correct number of tents or `-1` if it is impossible.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided. It correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences and handles impossible cases appropriately.
