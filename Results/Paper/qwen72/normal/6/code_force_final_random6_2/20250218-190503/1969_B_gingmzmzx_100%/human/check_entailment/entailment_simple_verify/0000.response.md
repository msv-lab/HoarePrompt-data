### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined without parameters, which is not ideal for handling multiple test cases. However, the function reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case individually, which is a common approach in competitive programming.
   - The input is read correctly, and the binary string `s` is converted to a list of integers.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `zeroes` correctly counts the number of zeros in the string `s`.
   - The variable `cnt` is initialized as a list with two elements, both set to 0. This list will keep track of the counts of zeros and ones encountered so far in the string.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will store the total cost of sorting the string.
   - The program iterates over each character `c` in the string `s` and updates the counts in `cnt`.
   - If `c` is 0, the program checks if there are any ones (`cnt[1] > 0`). If there are, it increments `ans` by 1. This is because a zero following a one requires at least one operation to move the zero to the left of the one.
   - If `c` is 1, the program adds the number of zeros that have not yet been counted (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`. This is because each one that is not at the end of the string will need to be moved to the right, and the cost of moving it is the number of zeros that are to its right.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total cost `ans` for each test case.

5. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The original assessment mentions that the program does not handle the case where the input string is already sorted. However, the program does correctly handle this case.
   - For a string like "0000", the program will correctly output 0 because there are no ones to move, and all zeros are already in place.

### Example Analysis:
- **Input: "10"**
  - `zeroes = 1`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 1: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [0, 1]` -> `ans += 1 - 0` -> `ans = 1`
  - Iteration 2: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [1, 1]` -> `ans += 1` -> `ans = 2`
  - Output: 2 (Correct)

- **Input: "0000"**
  - `zeroes = 4`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 1: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [1, 0]` -> `ans += 0` -> `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 2: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [2, 0]` -> `ans += 0` -> `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 3: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [3, 0]` -> `ans += 0` -> `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 4: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [4, 0]` -> `ans += 0` -> `ans = 0`
  - Output: 0 (Correct)

- **Input: "11000"**
  - `zeroes = 3`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 1: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [0, 1]` -> `ans += 3 - 0` -> `ans = 3`
  - Iteration 2: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [0, 2]` -> `ans += 3 - 0` -> `ans = 6`
  - Iteration 3: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [1, 2]` -> `ans += 1` -> `ans = 7`
  - Iteration 4: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [2, 2]` -> `ans += 1` -> `ans = 8`
  - Iteration 5: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [3, 2]` -> `ans += 1` -> `ans = 9`
  - Output: 9 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect. The program does handle the case where the input string is already sorted and correctly outputs 0. The program's logic for calculating the minimum cost to sort the binary string is also correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
