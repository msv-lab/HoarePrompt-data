#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the binary string and possibly the number of test cases. A corrected function definition might look like: `def min_cost_sort(s, t=1):` where `s` is a binary string and `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: `n` is 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of zeros in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of ones in `s`, `ans` is the total cost of sorting the binary string `s` such that all zeros come before all ones.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers. It then calculates the minimum cost required to sort the binary string `s` such that all zeros come before all ones. The function prints the calculated cost for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
