Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string with at least 2 elements, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `c` is the second element of `s`, `cnt` is [1, 0] with the `c`-th element incremented by 1, `ans` is `zeroes - 1` if `c` is not 0, or `ans` is 0 if `c` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is the second element of the list `s`.
- If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [1, 0] and the first element (index 0) is incremented by 1, making `cnt` [2, 0]. `ans` remains 0.
- If `c` is not 0, `cnt` is [1, 0] and the `c`-th element (index `c`) is incremented by 1. `ans` is set to `zeroes - 1`.
- The values of `n`, `s`, and `zeroes` remain unchanged.
