Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is 0, `ans` is the sum of the number of zeros in `s` plus the product of the number of ones in `s` and the number of zeros in `s` minus the number of zeros encountered so far.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of zeros in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of ones in `s`.
- The code snippet `cnt = [0, 0]` reassigns `cnt` to a new list with both elements set to 0.
- The values of `n`, `s`, `zeroes`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
