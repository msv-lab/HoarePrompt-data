Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is the second element of `s`, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is 1 if the first element of `s` is 1, otherwise `cnt[first element of s]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is 0 if the first element of `s` is 0, or `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]` if the first element of `s` is not 0, and `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**
