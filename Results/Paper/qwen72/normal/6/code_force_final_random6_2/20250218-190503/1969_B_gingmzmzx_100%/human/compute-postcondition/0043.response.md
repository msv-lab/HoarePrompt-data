The value of `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `cnt` is [1, 0] and the `c`-th element is incremented by 1. Since `c` is the third element of `s`, `c` can be either 0 or 1. If `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` becomes 2. If `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` becomes 1. The values of `n`, `s`, `zeroes`, and `ans` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string with at least 3 elements, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `c` is the third element of `s`, `cnt` is [2, 0] if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is [1, 1], `ans` is 0 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - 1`.**
