Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is calculated as `int(input()) - 1`.
2. `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
3. `s` is the last input string.
4. `a` is the integer value of the first word in the last `s`.
5. `b` is the integer value of the second word in the last `s`.
6. The sum of `a` and `b` is odd.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('alice')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'alice'`.
- The initial state provides information about variables `i`, `s`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The condition that the sum of `a` and `b` is odd is also not relevant to the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'alice'`, regardless of the values of `i`, `s`, `a`, and `b`.

Output: **alice**
