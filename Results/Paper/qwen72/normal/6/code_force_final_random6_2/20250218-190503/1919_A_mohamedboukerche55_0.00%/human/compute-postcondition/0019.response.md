Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters. It reads a series of inputs from the user, where each input is a string containing two integers separated by a space. The function processes the last input string, extracting the two integers `a` and `b`. It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints "bob". If the sum is odd, it prints "alice". The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the last input string and the extracted integers `a` and `b` are the final state of the program. **
