Postcondition: **`i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `s` is the last input string, `a` is the integer value of the first word in the last `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the last `s`, and the sum of `a` and `b` is odd.**
