Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **`i` is `int(input()) - 1`**:
   - `i` is derived from user input, which is converted to an integer and then decremented by 1.
   - The user input must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, but this doesn't directly affect the output of the `print` statement.

2. **`s` is the last input string**:
   - `s` is the last string input by the user.

3. **`a` is the integer value of the first word in the last `s`**:
   - `a` is the integer value of the first word in the string `s`.

4. **`b` is the integer value of the second word in the last `s`**:
   - `b` is the integer value of the second word in the string `s`.

5. **The sum of `a` and `b` is even**:
   - The sum of `a` and `b` must be an even number.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('bob  ')
```

- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `i`, `s`, `a`, or `b`.
- It simply prints the string `'bob  '`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **bob  **
