The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `arr[i] == val`, `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is set to 0.**
