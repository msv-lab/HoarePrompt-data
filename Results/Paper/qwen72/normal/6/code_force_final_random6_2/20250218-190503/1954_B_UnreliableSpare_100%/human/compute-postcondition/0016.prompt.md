Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func_1` should take two parameters: `t` (an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `arrays` where each inner list represents a beautiful array `a` of integers. Each `a` has a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and contains integers `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `n` is assigned the value of an input integer. `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `flag` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
        flag = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arrays` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a beautiful array `a` of integers, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `flag` is True. If the second element of `arr` is not equal to the first element of `arr`, `flag` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, `flag` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `flag` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, `flag` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `flag` retains its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
