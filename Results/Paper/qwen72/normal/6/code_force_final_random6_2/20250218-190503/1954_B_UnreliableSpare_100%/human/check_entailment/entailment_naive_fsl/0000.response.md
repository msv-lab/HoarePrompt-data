Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program does not handle the case where the array is already not beautiful and does not require any removals to stop being beautiful. According to the problem description, if the array is not beautiful, the minimum number of elements to remove should be 0. However, the program always tries to find the minimum count of a repeated value and prints that as the answer, which is incorrect.

**Example Case:**

Consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

The array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is not beautiful because no operation can be applied to it to make all elements the same. Therefore, the minimum number of elements to remove to stop it from being beautiful is 0. However, the program will output `1` because it incorrectly tries to find the minimum count of a repeated value.

This example demonstrates that the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
