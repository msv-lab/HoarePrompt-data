Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0.** 

The code snippet initializes `cnt` to 0, which is the only change from the initial state. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
