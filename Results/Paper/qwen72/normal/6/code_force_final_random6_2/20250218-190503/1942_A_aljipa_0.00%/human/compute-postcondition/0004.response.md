Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `res` is defined based on the values of `k` and `n`:
     - If `k` equals `n`, `res` is a list of `n` ones.
     - If `k` equals 1, `res` is a range from 0 to `n-1`.
     - Otherwise, `res` is a list containing `-1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(*res)` will print the elements of the list `res` separated by spaces.

Now, let's determine what will be printed based on the different conditions for `k` and `n`:

- **Case 1: `k` equals `n`**
  - `res` will be a list of `n` ones.
  - For example, if `n` is 5, `res` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
  - The print statement will output: `1 1 1 1 1`.

- **Case 2: `k` equals 1**
  - `res` will be a range from 0 to `n-1`.
  - For example, if `n` is 5, `res` will be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
  - The print statement will output: `0 1 2 3 4`.

- **Case 3: `k` is neither `n` nor 1**
  - `res` will be a list containing `-1`.
  - The print statement will output: `-1`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we need to consider all possible cases. However, based on the precondition, we can describe the output for each case:

Output: **[1 1 1 ... 1] (if k equals n, where the list contains n ones) or [0 1 2 ... n-1] (if k equals 1, where the list contains a range from 0 to n-1) or -1 (if k is neither n nor 1)**
