The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is the length of an array and `k` is a parameter related to sorting cyclic shifts. The function then prints a list `res` based on the values of `n` and `k`: if `k` equals `n`, it prints a list of `n` ones; if `k` equals 1, it prints a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; otherwise, it prints a list containing `-1`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, and `n`, `k`, and `res` holding the values of the last test case.
