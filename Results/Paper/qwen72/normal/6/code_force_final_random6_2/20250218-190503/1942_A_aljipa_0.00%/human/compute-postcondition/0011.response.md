Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, `res` is a list containing numbers from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, otherwise `res` is a list containing `-1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains `t - 2`.
- The value of `n` remains the first input integer.
- The value of `k` remains the second input integer.
- The value of `res` is updated based on the conditions:
  - If `k` equals `n`, `res` is a list of `n` ones.
  - If `k` equals 1, `res` is a list containing numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
  - Otherwise, `res` is a list containing `-1`.
