The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The other variables `n` and `k`, and the array `a` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
