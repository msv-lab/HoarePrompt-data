Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. This is done using `t = int(input())` and a loop `for _ in range(t)`.

2. **Case Handling**:
   - **Case 1: `k == n`**:
     - If `k` is equal to `n`, it means all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. The only way this can happen is if all elements in the array are the same. The program correctly handles this by creating an array of `n` elements, all set to `1` using `res = [1] * n`.
   - **Case 2: `k == 1`**:
     - If `k` is equal to `1`, it means exactly one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. One way to achieve this is to have an array where the elements are in strictly increasing order, and the first element is the smallest. The program correctly handles this by creating an array of `n` elements using `res = range(n)`, which generates a sequence from `0` to `n-1`.
   - **Case 3: `k != 1` and `k != n`**:
     - If `k` is neither `1` nor `n`, the program outputs `-1` using `res = [-1]`. However, this is not entirely correct. The problem description allows for `1 \leq k \leq n`, and the program should handle cases where `1 < k < n`. For such cases, a valid array can be constructed by having a segment of the array sorted and the rest unsorted, ensuring exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of each test case using `print(*res)`. This correctly unpacks the list `res` and prints its elements separated by spaces, which is the required format for the output.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `k` is `1` or `n` correctly.
   - However, it fails to handle cases where `1 < k < n`. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 3, 1]`, which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all valid cases where `1 < k < n`.

Final: **False**
