The value of `t` is assigned the result of converting the input to an integer using `int(input())`. The variables `n` and `k` remain as specified in the initial state, with `n` being an integer representing the length of the array `a`, and `k` being an integer representing the number of sorted cyclic shifts, such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `a`, and `k` is an integer representing the number of sorted cyclic shifts, such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3.**
