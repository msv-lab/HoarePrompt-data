Postcondition: ***`i` is the length of `l`, `k` is the third integer in `b`, `t` is greater than the length of `l`, `b` is a list of integers derived from the substrings of `a` separated by whitespace, `o` is a list of strings derived from the input split by whitespace and is now sorted in descending order, `n` is the first integer in `b`, `f` is the second integer in `b`, `fav` is the string at index `f - 1` in the sorted `o`, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a string from `o` and each value is the count of that string in `o`. If `o.index(fav) > k - 1`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statements in the loop.***
