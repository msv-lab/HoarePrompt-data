Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` and converting each element to an integer.
   - `o` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
   - `n` is equal to the first integer in the list `b`.
   - `f` is equal to the second integer in the list `b`.
   - `k` is equal to the third integer in the list `b`.
   - `k` is equal to `n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string 'YES'.
   - The values of `t`, `i`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, and `k` are not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - The condition `k` is equal to `n` is given, but it does not affect the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
