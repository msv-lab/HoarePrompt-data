The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the length of `l` minus 1, and `t` is the total number of iterations the loop is set to run. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the current value of `i`.

State: **`i` is the length of `l`, `k` is the initial `k` minus the sum of the counts of all strings in `l` that are not equal to `fav`, `t` must be greater than the length of `l`**
