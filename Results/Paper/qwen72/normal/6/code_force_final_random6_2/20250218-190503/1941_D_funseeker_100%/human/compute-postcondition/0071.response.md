Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` for each iteration of the loop, where `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1()` in each iteration. `m` is 0, and `temp` is an empty set.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged from the initial state.
- The value of `m` is now 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The value of `x` remains unchanged from the initial state.
- The set `ans` contains all unique values generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` for each iteration of the loop, where `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1()` in each iteration.
- The set `temp` is an empty set, as it is reset to empty at the end of each iteration.
