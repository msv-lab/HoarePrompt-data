The value `0` is removed from the set `ans` if it exists. Since the initial state specifies that `ans` contains the value `0`, after the execution of `ans.discard(0)`, the value `0` is no longer in the set `ans`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, and `temp`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` for each iteration of the loop, where `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1()` in each iteration, but `0` is not included in `ans` anymore, `m` is 0, and `temp` is an empty set.**
