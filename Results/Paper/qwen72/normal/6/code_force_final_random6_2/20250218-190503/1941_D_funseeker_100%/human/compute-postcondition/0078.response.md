The function `func_4` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `x`. These parameters are integers with the following constraints: 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.
