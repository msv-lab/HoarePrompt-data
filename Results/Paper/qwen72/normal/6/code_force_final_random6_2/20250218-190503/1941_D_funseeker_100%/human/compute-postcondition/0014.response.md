Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 2 elements, `m` is greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace. `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '?', otherwise `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '1', and remains an empty set if `c` is neither '1' nor '?'.**

Explanation:
- The code `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
- If `c` is '?', `temp` already contains `(q - r) % n`, so after adding `(q + r) % n`, `temp` will contain both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
- If `c` is '1', `temp` was initially a set containing `(q - r) % n`, but after adding `(q + r) % n`, `temp` will only contain `(q + r) % n` since the previous value `(q - r) % n` is not mentioned in the initial state.
- If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', `temp` was initially an empty set, and after adding `(q + r) % n`, `temp` will contain only `(q + r) % n`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged.
