The code snippet `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Given the initial state, we need to evaluate the impact of this code on the variables and their values.

- `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 1 element.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `r` is an integer.
- `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, and `c` is either '1' or '?'.
- If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`, and `q` is the first element in `ans`.
- Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.

Given that `c` is either '1' or '?', and the code snippet is `temp.add((q - r) % n)`, we can infer the following:

1. If `c` is '1', `temp` remains an empty set, and this code snippet will add `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
2. If `c` is '?', `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n`, and this code snippet will add `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 1 element, `m` is greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is either '1' or '?', and `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '?', or `temp` is a set containing the value `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1'.**
