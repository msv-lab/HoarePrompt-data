You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and x are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n.
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` for each iteration of the loop, where `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1()` in each iteration. `m` is 0, and `temp` is an empty set.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: *`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` for each iteration of the loop. `m` is 0, and `temp` is an empty set. If `0` is in `ans`, `0` is removed from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where `ans` is the set after the operations described, and its length will remain unchanged if `0` is not in `ans`, or it will remain the same if `0` is in `ans` and is replaced by `n`)
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: - The `print(*sorted(ans))` statement will print the sorted elements of the set `ans`.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `q` and `r` are not provided, and the function `func_3()` is not defined, we can't determine the exact numerical values in `ans`. However, we can describe the output based on the operations and conditions given:
    #
    #- If `0` was in `ans`, it will be removed and `n` will be added.
    #- The final set `ans` will be sorted and printed.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters `n`, `m`, and `x`, which are integers with constraints 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the exact return value is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
