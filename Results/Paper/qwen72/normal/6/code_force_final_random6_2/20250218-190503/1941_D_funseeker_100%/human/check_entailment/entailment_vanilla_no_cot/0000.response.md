Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the described problem. It reads the input, processes the throws according to the rules, and outputs the correct number of players who could have the ball at the end of the game, along with their numbers in increasing order. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read input lines efficiently.
   - It processes the number of test cases and the details of each test case using helper functions.

2. **Processing Throws**:
   - For each test case, it initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - It iterates through each throw, updating the set of possible players who could have the ball.
   - If the direction is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the result of moving `r` steps clockwise to the temporary set `temp`.
   - If the direction is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the result of moving `r` steps counterclockwise to `temp`.
   - The set `ans` is then updated to the contents of `temp`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the set `ans` contains `0`, it is removed and `n` is added to account for the circular nature of the game (player `0` is the same as player `n`).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball.
   - It prints the sorted list of these players, ensuring they are in increasing order and all numbers are different.

The program efficiently handles the constraints and correctly computes the possible positions of the ball after all the throws, making it a correct solution to the problem.
