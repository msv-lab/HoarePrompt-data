To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
   - `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` for each iteration of the loop.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `temp` is an empty set.

2. **Operations:**
   - If `0` is in `ans`, `0` is removed from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The set `ans` is initially populated with unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`.
   - The operation to remove `0` from `ans` and add `n` to `ans` only happens if `0` is present in `ans`.
   - The length of `ans` will be affected by this operation, but we need to understand the initial composition of `ans` to determine the final length.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `0` is in `ans`:
     - `0` is removed from `ans`.
     - `n` is added to `ans`.
     - The length of `ans` remains the same because we are removing one element and adding one element.
   - If `0` is not in `ans`:
     - `ans` remains unchanged.
     - The length of `ans` remains the same as it was initially.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are not provided, and the initial composition of `ans` is not explicitly defined, we can only describe the output based on the given operations and conditions.

Output: **len(ans) (where `ans` is the set after the operations described, and its length will remain unchanged if `0` is not in `ans`, or it will remain the same if `0` is in `ans` and is replaced by `n`)**
