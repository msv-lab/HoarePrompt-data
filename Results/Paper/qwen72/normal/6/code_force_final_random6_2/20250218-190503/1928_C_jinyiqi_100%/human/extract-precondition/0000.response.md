Precondition: **x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should take two parameters, `n` and `x`, as described in the problem. Here is the correct function definition and its precondition:

Function definition:
```
def count_valid_ks(n, x):
```

Precondition: **n and x are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9.**
