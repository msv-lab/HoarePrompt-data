### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the number of natural numbers \( k \) such that a given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit the described pattern of settling.
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, with the first \( k \) positions increasing and the next \( k - 2 \) positions decreasing.

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - For a given \( n \) and \( x \), \( k \) must be such that \( n \) falls into one of the repeating segments.
   - The position \( n \) can be either in the increasing segment (positions 1 to \( k \)) or the decreasing segment (positions \( k + 1 \) to \( 2k - 2 \)).

3. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - If \( n \) is in the increasing segment, then \( n \mod (2k - 2) \le k \).
   - If \( n \) is in the decreasing segment, then \( n \mod (2k - 2) > k \) and \( n \mod (2k - 2) \le 2k - 2 \).

4. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to find all divisors of a given number.
   - It then checks if the divisors fit the constraints for \( k \).

5. **Program Breakdown:**
   - **Input Reading:**
     - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
     - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).

   - **Divisor Calculation:**
     - `func_1` calculates all divisors of a given number \( x \).
     - It returns a list of divisors in descending order.

   - **Condition Checking:**
     - The program checks if \((n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0\) and \((n - x) \% 2 == 0\).
     - For each condition, it finds the divisors of the respective number and checks if they fit the constraints for \( k \).

   - **Valid \( k \) Calculation:**
     - The program correctly checks if the divisors fit the constraints for \( k \) by ensuring \((s + 2) \% 2 == 0\) and \((s + 2) / 2 \ge x\).

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - **Divisor Calculation:**
     - `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of a number.
   - **Condition Checking:**
     - The conditions \((n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0\) and \((n - x) \% 2 == 0\) are necessary to ensure that \( n \) and \( x \) fit into the pattern.
   - **Valid \( k \) Calculation:**
     - The program correctly checks if the divisors fit the constraints for \( k \) by ensuring \((s + 2) \% 2 == 0\) and \((s + 2) / 2 \ge x\).
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - The program handles edge cases where \( k = 1 \) is not valid.
     - It also handles the constraints \( 1 \le x < n \le 10^9 \).

### Detailed Analysis:

- **func_1:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of a given number \( x \) and returns them in descending order.
  - This is essential for the main logic to work, as it helps in identifying potential \( k \) values.

- **Main Logic:**
  - The program checks two conditions: \((n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0\) and \((n - x) \% 2 == 0\).
  - These conditions are derived from the pattern and are necessary to ensure that \( n \) and \( x \) fit into the pattern.
  - For each condition, it finds the divisors of the respective number and checks if they fit the constraints for \( k \).
  - The program ensures that \( k \) is a natural number greater than 1 and that \( k \) is valid based on the given position \( n \) and number \( x \).

- **Output:**
  - The program collects all valid \( k \) values, removes duplicates, and prints the count.
  - This is done using a set to ensure that each \( k \) is counted only once.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the number of valid \( k \) values based on the given constraints. The divisor calculation and condition checking are appropriate for the problem.
