The function `func` processes a file where each test case is represented by a line of space-separated integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the difference between the total number of integers and the number of unique integers in that line. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the file has been read, and the results for each test case have been printed to the console.
