### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, you and Nene, each receiving `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards.
   - Each card has an integer from 1 to `n`, and each integer appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To maximize your score, you should play a card that has already been played by Nene, if possible.
   - Nene will always play a card that has already been played by you, if possible, to maximize her score and minimize yours.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the input from `open(0)`, which is a shorthand for reading from standard input.
   - It processes every second line starting from the third line, which corresponds to the lines containing the card values in your hand.
   - The program splits the line into tokens (card values) and calculates the number of duplicates in your hand.
   - The number of duplicates is determined by the difference between the total number of cards and the number of unique cards.

4. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program calculates the number of duplicates in your hand, which is the number of cards that appear more than once.
   - This number of duplicates is indeed the maximum number of points you can score because each duplicate card can be played after Nene has already played the matching card.
   - However, the program does not explicitly account for the optimal play of Nene. Specifically, if you have a duplicate card, Nene will play the matching card as soon as possible to prevent you from scoring. But the program's approach of counting duplicates is still correct because:
     - If you have a duplicate, Nene will play the matching card on her turn, and you will score a point when you play the duplicate.
     - If you don't have a duplicate, you cannot score a point, and Nene will play optimally to maximize her score.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `1 1 2 3`, the program will output `1` because there is one duplicate (1). This is correct.
   - For the input `7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5`, the program will output `2` because there are two duplicates (8 and 5). This is correct.
   - For the input `7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6`, the program will output `1` because there is one duplicate (4). This is correct.
   - For the input `1 2 3`, the program will output `0` because there are no duplicates. This is correct.
   - For the input `1`, the program will output `0` because there are no duplicates. This is correct.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly calculates the number of duplicates in your hand, which is a key part of the solution.
   - The program's logic aligns with the optimal strategy for both players, even though it does not explicitly model Nene's optimal play.
   - The program's output matches the expected results for the given examples, suggesting that it is correct for the specific problem constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct for the given problem constraints and examples. It accurately calculates the maximum number of points you can score by counting the duplicates in your hand, which is the optimal strategy given Nene's optimal play.
