You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of cards each player receives. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
        
    #State: The file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 2t + 1 lines, `line` is the (2t + 1)-th line of the file.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It is designed to process multiple test cases, where each test case involves a sequence of integers representing the cards in a player's hand. For each test case, it returns a result based on the analysis of the card sequence. The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. For each test case, the number of cards, `n`, is an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5. The integers on the cards, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, are within the range 1 to `n`, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the sequence. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
