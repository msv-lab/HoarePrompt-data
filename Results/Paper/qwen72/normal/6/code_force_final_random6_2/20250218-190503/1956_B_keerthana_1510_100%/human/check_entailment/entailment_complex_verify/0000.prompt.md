You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of cards each player receives. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
        
    #State: The file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 2t + 1 lines, `line` is the (2t + 1)-th line of the file.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a file where each test case is represented by a line of space-separated integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the difference between the total number of integers and the number of unique integers in that line. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the file has been read, and the results for each test case have been printed to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem. The program simply calculates the difference between the number of cards and the number of unique cards in the player's hand, which does not account for the optimal play strategy required by the problem.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```
The expected output is `1` because the player can score 1 point by playing the second card with `1` after Nene has played her `2` and `3` cards. However, the provided program will output `1` because it only counts the number of duplicates in the hand, which is correct in this case.

However, consider another input:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
The expected output is `0` because the player cannot score any points since Nene will always play the matching card after the player plays a card. The provided program will output `0` because there are no duplicates in the hand, which is correct in this case.

The problem arises with more complex inputs. For example:
```
1
4
1 1 2 2
```
The expected output is `2` because the player can play both `1` and `2` cards after Nene has played her cards, scoring 2 points. However, the provided program will output `2` because it only counts the number of duplicates, which does not consider the optimal play strategy.

Thus, the program does not handle the optimal play strategy and fails to correctly determine the maximum number of points the player can score in all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
