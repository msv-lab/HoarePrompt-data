Let's break down the code step by step based on the initial state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
   - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.
   - The file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 7 lines.
   - `line` is the seventh line of the file.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `line.split()` splits the seventh line of the file into a list of tokens (words or substrings separated by whitespace).
   - `tokens` is the list of tokens obtained from `line.split()`.
   - `len(tokens)` gives the number of tokens in the list.
   - `{*tokens}` creates a set from the list of tokens, which removes any duplicate tokens.
   - `len({*tokens})` gives the number of unique tokens in the list.
   - The expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` calculates the difference between the total number of tokens and the number of unique tokens, which is the number of duplicate tokens in the list.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the number of duplicate tokens in the seventh line of the file.

Since the exact content of the seventh line is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **number of duplicate tokens in the seventh line of the file**
