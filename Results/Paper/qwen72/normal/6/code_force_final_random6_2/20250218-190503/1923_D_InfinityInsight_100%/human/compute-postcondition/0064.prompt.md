Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 1, `left` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from 0, `last` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the same value before the current index, or -1 if the value has not been seen before, `ans` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is -1, `i` is the last element in `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
        ans[i] = 1
        continue
    x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
    inx = func_1(left, x)
    inx2 = last[i - 1]
    if inx2 < inx:
        inx = inx2
    if inx < 0:
        continue
    ans[i] = i + 1 - inx


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: - `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 1.
   - `left` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from 0.
   - `last` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the same value before the current index, or -1 if the value has not been seen before.
   - `ans` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is -1 except `ans[1]` which is now `2 - inx`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` is `left[1] - a[1] - 1`.
   - If `inx` is less than 0, `inx` is set to -1 and `inx2` is set to -1, and the program skips the rest of the current loop iteration.

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 2, `left` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from 0, `last` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the same value before the current index, or -1 if the value has not been seen before, `ans` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is -1 except `ans[1]` which is `2 - inx2` and `ans[2]` which is set to 1 if `a[2] < a[1]`, `i` is 2, `x` is `left[1] - a[1] - 1`, `inx` is equal to `inx2`, `inx2` is `last[1]`, and `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 3, `left` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from 0, `last` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the same value before the current index, or -1 if the value has not been seen before, `ans` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is -1 except `ans[1]` which is `2 - inx2`, `ans[2]` which is set to 1 if `a[2] < a[1]`, `ans[3]` which is set to 1 if `a[3] < a[2]`, `ans[3]` is now set to `4 - inx`, `i` is 3, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`. If `inx < 0`, `inx` is updated to `last[2]` and `inx2` remains `last[2]`. Otherwise, `inx` and `inx2` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
