Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 1, `left` is a list containing integers 0 and \(a[0]\), `last` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the same value before the current index, or -1 if the value has not been seen before, `ans` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is -1, `i` is \(a[0]\).**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `left` is a list containing a single integer 0.
- The code `left.append(left[-1] + i)` appends the sum of the last element in `left` (which is 0) and `i` (which is `a[0]`) to the list `left`.
- Therefore, `left` now contains two elements: 0 and `a[0]`.
- The values of `a`, `n`, `last`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
