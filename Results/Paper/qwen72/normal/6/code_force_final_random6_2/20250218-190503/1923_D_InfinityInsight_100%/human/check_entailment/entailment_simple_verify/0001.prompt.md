You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the index found by `func_1(left, x)` and `inx2` is `last[i-1]`. If `inx2 < inx`, `inx` is updated to `inx2`. If `inx < 0`, the update is skipped. The variable `i` is the last element in the list `a`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the list `ans` which has been updated for all indices from 1 to \(n-1\) based on the conditions specified. For each index `i` in the range 1 to \(n-1\), if `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the index found by `func_1(left, x)` and `inx2` is `last[i-1]`. If `inx2` is less than `inx`, `inx` is updated to `inx2`. If `inx` is less than 0, the update is skipped. The final value of `ans` depends on the specific values in `a`, `left`, and `last`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a line of slimes, each with a specific size.
   - Each second, a slime can eat one of its neighbors if it is strictly larger than the neighbor.
   - We need to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten, or report -1 if it is impossible.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is used to find the index of the smallest element in a list that is greater than or equal to a given value.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes each test case and calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten.

3. **Function 1: `func_1(a, x)`**:
   - This function uses `bisect_left` to find the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1, indicating an invalid input.
   - It then finds the index using `bl` and checks if the element at that index is exactly `x`. If it is, it returns the index + 1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the index found by `bl`.

4. **Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`**:
   - This function initializes two lists: `left` and `last`.
   - `left` is a prefix sum array that stores the cumulative sum of the sizes of slimes up to each index.
   - `last` keeps track of the last index where the size of the slime was different from the previous slime.
   - `ans` is initialized to a list of -1s, representing the minimum time for each slime to be eaten.
   - The function iterates through the slimes and updates the `last` list.
   - It then iterates through the slimes again to determine the minimum time for each slime to be eaten:
     - If the current slime is smaller than the previous slime, it can be eaten in 1 second.
     - Otherwise, it calculates a value `x` which is the cumulative sum of sizes up to the current slime minus the size of the current slime minus 1.
     - It uses `func_1` to find the index of the smallest cumulative sum that is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - It then checks if this index is valid and updates the `ans` list accordingly.

5. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The use of `bisect_left` in `func_1` is appropriate for finding the smallest index greater than or equal to a given value.
   - The prefix sum array `left` is correctly constructed to keep track of the cumulative sizes of slimes.
   - The `last` list is used to efficiently find the last index where the size of the slime was different, which helps in determining the minimum time for a slime to be eaten.
   - The logic for updating the `ans` list is correct:
     - If a slime is smaller than its previous neighbor, it can be eaten in 1 second.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum time by finding the appropriate index using `func_1` and checking the `last` list.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where a slime is impossible to be eaten by returning -1.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the slime is the first in the line and has no previous neighbor to compare with.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum time for each slime to be eaten or reporting -1 if it is impossible. The use of prefix sums and binary search (via `bisect_left`) is efficient and appropriate for the problem.

Correctness: **True**
