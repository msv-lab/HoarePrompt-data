The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `n` representing the length of `a`. It returns a list `ans` of the same length as `a`, where each element at index `i` (from 1 to \(n-1\)) is updated based on the following conditions: If `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the minimum of the index found by `func_1(left, x)` and `last[i-1]`. If `inx` is less than 0, `ans[i]` remains -1. The list `a` remains unchanged, and the final state of `ans` depends on the specific values in `a`, `left`, and `last`.
