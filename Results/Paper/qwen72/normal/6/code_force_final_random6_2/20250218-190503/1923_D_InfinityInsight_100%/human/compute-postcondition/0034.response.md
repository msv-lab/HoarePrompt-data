The value of `inx` is updated to be equal to the value of `inx2`. Given that `inx2` is `last[0]`, and `last[0]` is the index of the last occurrence of the value `a[0]` before the current index (which is 0), or -1 if the value has not been seen before, `inx` is now -1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 1, `left` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from 0, `last` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the same value before the current index, or -1 if the value has not been seen before, `ans` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is -1 except `ans[1]` which is 1 if `a[1]` is less than `a[0]`, `i` is 1, `x` is `left[1] - a[1] - 1`, `inx` is -1, `inx2` is -1.**
