Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\), and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 1. `left` is a list containing a single integer 0. `last` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the same value before the current index, or -1 if the value has not been seen before. `ans` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is -1. `i` is \(n - 1\).**

Natural language explanation:
- The list `a` remains unchanged, containing integers within the specified range.
- The variable `n` is the length of `a` and must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
- The list `left` still contains a single integer 0, as it is not modified in the loop.
- The list `last` is now of length `n`, with each element at index `i` representing the last occurrence of the value `a[i]` before `i`, or -1 if `a[i]` has not been seen before.
- The list `ans` remains unchanged, with all elements set to -1.
- The loop variable `i` reaches `n - 1` after the final iteration, indicating the loop has completed.
