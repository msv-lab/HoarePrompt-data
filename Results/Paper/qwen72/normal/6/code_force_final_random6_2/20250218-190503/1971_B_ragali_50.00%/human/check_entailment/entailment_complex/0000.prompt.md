Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and each string s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        
        a = set()
        
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is 0, `i` is the last character of the last processed string `s`, `s` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed and must not be empty, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the last processed string `s`. If `len(a) > 1`, then `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` (from the middle to the end) with the first half of `s` (from the start to the middle), and `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`. If `len(a) == 1`, then `newstr` and `isreverse` remain as defined in the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s`. It checks if the string `s` contains more than one unique character. If so, it prints 'YES' and then prints a modified version of `s` that is either the second half concatenated with the first half, the reversed string, or a combination of both, ensuring the output is different from the original string `s`. If the string `s` contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes.
