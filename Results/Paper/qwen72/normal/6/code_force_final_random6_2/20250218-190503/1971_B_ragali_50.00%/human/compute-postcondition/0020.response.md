Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is the last character of `s`, `s` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s`, and the set `a` contains more than one unique character. `newstr` is the concatenation of the second half of `s` (starting from the middle index) and the first half of `s` (up to the middle index). `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`. `newstr` is equal to `s`, and `isreverse` is equal to `s`.***
