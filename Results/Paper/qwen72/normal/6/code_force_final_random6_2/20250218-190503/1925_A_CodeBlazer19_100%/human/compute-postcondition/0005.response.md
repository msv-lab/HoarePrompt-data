Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes an input string, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer, assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions for `t` and `i`, and the new values for `n` and `k` as input integers.
