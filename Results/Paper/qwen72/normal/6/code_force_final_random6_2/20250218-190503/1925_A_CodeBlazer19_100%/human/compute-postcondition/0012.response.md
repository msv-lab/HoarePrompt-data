Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input (`stdin`), where each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 26). For each test case, it generates a string by repeating the first `k` letters of the English alphabet `n` times and prints this string to standard output (`stdout`). After processing all test cases, the function completes execution, and the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are no longer in use. **
