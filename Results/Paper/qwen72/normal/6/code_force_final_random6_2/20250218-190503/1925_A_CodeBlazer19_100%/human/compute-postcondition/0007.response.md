The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `n` and `k` are input integers.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers.**
