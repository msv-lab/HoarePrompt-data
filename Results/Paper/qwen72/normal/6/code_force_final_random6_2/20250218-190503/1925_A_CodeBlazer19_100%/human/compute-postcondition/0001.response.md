The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself and starts from 0.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is not something we need to adjust manually as it is managed by the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
