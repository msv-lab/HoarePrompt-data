Reasoning:

The function `func` aims to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The function constructs the string by repeating the first `k` letters of the English alphabet `n` times. 

Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **String Construction**:
   - The string is constructed by taking the first `k` letters of the English alphabet and repeating this sequence `n` times.
   - This ensures that the string `s` contains all possible subsequences of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` letters. For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `s` will be `abcbac`, which contains all subsequences of length 2 formed from `a`, `b`, and `c`.

3. **Output**: The function prints the constructed string for each test case, which is the correct output format.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 1` and any `k`, the string will be the first `k` letters of the alphabet, which is correct.
   - For `k = 1` and any `n`, the string will be `n` repetitions of the letter `a`, which is correct.

5. **Optimality**:
   - The function generates a string of length `n * k`, which is the smallest possible length that can contain all required subsequences. This is because each letter in the first `k` letters must appear at least `n` times to ensure all subsequences of length `n` are covered.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
