### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of each operation is the length of the chosen substring.
   - We need to minimize the total cost of all operations.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The function reads a binary string and converts it into a list of integers.
     - It initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of 1s and `ans` to store the total cost.
     - It iterates through the string:
       - If the current character is `1`, it increments `n`.
       - If the current character is `0` and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - **Input Handling in `func_1`:**
     - The function `func_1` reads the input using `input().split()`, which is incorrect for a binary string. The input should be read as a single string, not split into a list.
     - The correct way to read a binary string is `s = input().strip()`.
   - **Conversion to List of Integers:**
     - The function converts the string to a list of integers using `list(map(int, s))`. This is correct, but it should be `list(map(int, s))` or `list(map(int, list(s)))` if `s` is a string.
   - **Logic for Calculating Cost:**
     - The logic for calculating the cost is flawed. The current implementation adds `n + 1` to `ans` for each `0` that comes after at least one `1`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the actual cost of moving 1s to the right of 0s.
     - The correct approach is to find the number of transitions from `1` to `0` and calculate the cost based on these transitions. The minimum cost to sort the string is the length of the longest contiguous segment of `1`s that needs to be moved to the right of all `0`s.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - For a binary string to be sorted in non-descending order, all `1`s should be to the right of all `0`s.
   - The minimum cost to achieve this is the length of the longest contiguous segment of `1`s that needs to be moved to the right of all `0`s.
   - This can be calculated by finding the number of transitions from `1` to `0` and then summing the lengths of the substrings that need to be shifted.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the issues in input handling and the logic for calculating the cost. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
