Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input correctly. The function `func_1` expects the binary string to be input as a list of integers, but the problem description specifies that the input is a binary string. This means that the input should be read as a string and not split into a list of integers. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the string is already sorted, and it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for sorting the string. For example, for the input "101011", the program will not produce the correct output of 5. 

To correct this, the program should read the input as a string and handle the logic for calculating the minimum cost to sort the string correctly.
