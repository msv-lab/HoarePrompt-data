The function `solve` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a binary string s (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}) that needs to be sorted. The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function should print the minimum total cost to sort each string to stdout.
