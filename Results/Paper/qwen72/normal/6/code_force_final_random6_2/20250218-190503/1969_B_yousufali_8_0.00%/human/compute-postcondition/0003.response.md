The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, but it is not specified how much it decreases by each iteration. Assuming the loop decreases `t` by 1 each iteration, `t` would be `t - 1` at the start of the next iteration, and it must still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0** (Note: Since the loop variable `_` is not used, it does not affect the state, and `t` is the only variable that matters. However, for the loop to execute again, `t` must have been decremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, so the correct state should be `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0.)

To clarify the adjustment:
State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0**
