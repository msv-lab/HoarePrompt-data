Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s).
   - `i` is `len(s) - 1`, which means `i` is the index of the last element in the list `s`.
   - `n` is the number of 1s in `s`.
   - `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 in `s` that comes after at least one 1.

2. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - We need to count the number of 0s in `s` that appear after at least one 1.
   - For each such 0, we add `n + 1` to `ans`.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - First, determine the number of 1s in the list `s` and store it in `n`.
   - Then, iterate through the list `s` from the beginning to the end.
   - For each 0 encountered, check if it comes after at least one 1.
   - If it does, add `n + 1` to `ans`.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `s = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`.
   - `n` is the number of 1s in `s`, which is 3.
   - The 0s in `s` that come after at least one 1 are at indices 1, 3, and 5.
   - For each of these 0s, we add `n + 1` (which is 4) to `ans`.
   - Therefore, `ans` will be `4 + 4 + 4 = 12`.

5. **General Case:**
   - The value of `ans` will be the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 in `s` that comes after at least one 1.
   - If there are no 0s after any 1s, `ans` will be 0.
   - If there are multiple 0s after 1s, `ans` will be the number of such 0s multiplied by `n + 1`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` calculated as described above.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of n + 1 for each 0 in s that comes after at least one 1, and n is the number of 1s in s)**
