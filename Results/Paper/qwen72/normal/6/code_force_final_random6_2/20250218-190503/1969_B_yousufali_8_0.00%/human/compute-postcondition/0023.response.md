Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads a list of integers (0s and 1s) from the input, processes this list, and prints an integer `ans`. The value of `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 in the list that comes after at least one 1, where `n` is the count of 1s encountered before the 0. The function does not return any value. **
