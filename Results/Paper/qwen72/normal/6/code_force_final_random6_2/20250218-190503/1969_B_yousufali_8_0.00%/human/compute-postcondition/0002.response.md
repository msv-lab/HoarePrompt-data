Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0
```
func_1()
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The function `func_1()` is called, but without knowing the definition of `func_1()`, we cannot determine its specific effects on the variables or the program state. However, since no changes to variables or the program state are specified, we assume that the function does not alter the initial state.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
