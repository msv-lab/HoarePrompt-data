Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each shift is the length of the substring.
   - The minimum total cost to achieve this sorting needs to be calculated for multiple test cases.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - This part is correct as it follows the problem's input format.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` reads a binary string `s` from the input, converts it to a list of integers, and initializes `n` and `ans` to 0.
   - The loop iterates over each character in `s`:
     - If the character is `1`, it increments `n` (the count of `1`s encountered so far).
     - If the character is `0` and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. This is because each `0` that comes after a `1` indicates a potential need to shift the substring to the left to sort the string.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`, which is the total cost calculated.

4. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is based on the idea that the cost of sorting a binary string is the sum of the lengths of the substrings that need to be shifted to move `1`s to the right of `0`s.
   - However, the logic is flawed because it does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts. Specifically, it does not consider the possibility of performing a single large shift that might be more efficient than multiple smaller shifts.

5. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to sort the binary string. For example, in the third test case `11000`, the optimal solution is to perform a single shift of the entire string, which would cost 5 (not 9).
   - The solution also fails to handle cases where the string is already sorted, as it always adds `n + 1` to `ans` for each `0` after a `1`, even if the string is already sorted.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is incorrect because it does not follow the optimal strategy for cyclic shifts and overestimates the cost in many cases.

Correctness: **False**
