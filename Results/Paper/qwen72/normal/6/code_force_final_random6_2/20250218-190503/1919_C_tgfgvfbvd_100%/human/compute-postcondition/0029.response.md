The code snippet swaps the values of `a` and `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, and `x` remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `x` is `x + 1`, this means that `x` has already been incremented by 1 before the swap occurs.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ t) and must be greater than `x + 1`, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `x + 1`, `a` and `b` have swapped their values.**
