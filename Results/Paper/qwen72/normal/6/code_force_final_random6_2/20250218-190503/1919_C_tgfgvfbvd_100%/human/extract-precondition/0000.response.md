Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains the array a of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) with elements a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**

However, the function definition provided is incomplete. For a more accurate function definition, it should be:

```python
def min_penalty(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing `n` and the list `a`.
