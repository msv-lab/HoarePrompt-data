Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ t) and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user. If `l[x]` ≤ `b`, then `b` is set to `l[x]`, `a` remains infinity, and `c` remains 0. If `l[x]` > `b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`, `b` remains infinity, and `c` is set to 1. In both cases, `l[x]` is greater than the initial value of `a`, and the condition `a` > `b` is checked, with `a` being updated to `b` if it is true.***
