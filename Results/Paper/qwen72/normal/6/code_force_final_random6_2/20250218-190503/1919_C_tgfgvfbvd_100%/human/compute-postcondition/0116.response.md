Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `x` is `n - 1`.
   - `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`.
   - `b` is the second smallest integer in the list `l` (or `float('inf')` if there is no second smallest integer).
   - `c` is the count of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(c)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`.
   - `b` is the second smallest integer in the list `l`. If there is no second smallest integer (i.e., all elements in `l` are the same), `b` is set to `float('inf')`.
   - `c` is the count of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

4. **Explanation:**
   - If `b` is `float('inf')`, it means there is no second smallest integer, and thus no integer in `l` can be greater than `b`. Therefore, `c` will be 0.
   - If `b` is a valid second smallest integer, `c` will count how many integers in `l` are greater than both `a` and `b`.

5. **Output:**
   - The value of `c` will be printed, which is the count of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

Since the exact values of `l` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `c`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

Output: **c (where c is the count of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`)**
