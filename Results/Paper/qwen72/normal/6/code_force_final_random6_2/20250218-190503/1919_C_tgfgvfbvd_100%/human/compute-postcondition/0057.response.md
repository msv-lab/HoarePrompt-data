Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 0, and `c` is 0. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[0]` and `b` retains its original value of `float('inf')`. If `l[0]` is greater than `a`, then `b` is updated to `l[0]` and `c` remains 0 if `l[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise `a` is updated to `l[0]` and `c` is set to 1.***
