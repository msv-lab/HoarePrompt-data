Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ t) and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is infinity, `b` is infinity, `c` is 0, and `a` is equal to `b`.**

Explanation: The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, so `a` is now infinity and `b` is also infinity. The condition that `a` is greater than `b` is no longer valid, as they are now equal. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
