Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`, `b` is the second smallest integer in the list `l` (if it exists, otherwise it remains `float('inf')`), and `c` is the number of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `l` to a new list of integers provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) are not directly affected by this code, but the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be determined based on the new list `l`. The loop condition and the constraints on `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
