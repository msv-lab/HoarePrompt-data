Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ t) and must be greater than `x + 1`, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `x + 1`. If `l[x]` ≤ `a`, `a` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` > `b`, `a` is set to `l[x]` and `c` is increased by 1. If `l[x]` ≤ `b` and `l[x]` > `a`, `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `a` > `b`, `a` and `b` have swapped their values.***
