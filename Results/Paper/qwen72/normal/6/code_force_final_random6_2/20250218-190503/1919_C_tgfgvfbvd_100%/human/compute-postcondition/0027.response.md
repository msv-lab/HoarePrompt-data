Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ t) and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `x`. If `l[x]` ≤ `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. If `a` > `b`, `a` and `b` swap values. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `l[x]` > `a`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x]` ≤ `b`, otherwise `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `c` is incremented by 1. If `a` > `b`, `a` and `b` swap values. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
