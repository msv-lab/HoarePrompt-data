Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 0, and `c` is 0. If `a` > `b`, then `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the previous value of `a`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their original values of `float('inf')`. The first element of `l` (i.e., `l[0]`) is greater than `a`. The current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`.**
