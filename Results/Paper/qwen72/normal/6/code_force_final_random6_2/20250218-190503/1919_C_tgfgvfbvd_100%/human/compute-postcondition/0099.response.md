Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 1, and `c` is 0. If `a` > `b`, then `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the previous value of `a`. Otherwise, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
