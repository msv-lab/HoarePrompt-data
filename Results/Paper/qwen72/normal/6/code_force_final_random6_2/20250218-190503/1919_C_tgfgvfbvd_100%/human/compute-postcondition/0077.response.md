Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `x` is `n - 1`.
   - `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`.
   - `b` is the second smallest integer in the list `l` (if it exists, otherwise it remains `float('inf')`).
   - `c` is the number of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(c)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `t` is a positive integer, but it is not used in the code snippet provided.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0, and `x` is calculated as `n - 1`. This is not directly relevant to the `print(c)` statement.
   - `l` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`.
   - `b` is the second smallest integer in the list `l`. If there is no second smallest integer (i.e., all elements are the same), `b` remains `float('inf')`.
   - `c` is the number of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

4. **Determine the Value of `c`:**
   - To find `c`, we need to count the number of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.
   - If `b` is `float('inf')`, it means there is no second smallest integer, and thus, all integers in `l` are equal to `a`. In this case, `c` will be 0 because no integer in `l` can be greater than `a` and `b` (since `b` is `float('inf')`).
   - If `b` is a valid second smallest integer, `c` will be the count of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(c)` statement will output the value of `c`, which is the number of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

Output: **c (where c is the number of integers in `l` that are greater than both the smallest integer `a` and the second smallest integer `b` in the list `l`)**
