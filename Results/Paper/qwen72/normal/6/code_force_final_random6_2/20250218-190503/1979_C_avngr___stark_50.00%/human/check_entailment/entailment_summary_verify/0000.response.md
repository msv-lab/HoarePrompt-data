### Reasoning

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle the case where all multipliers are the same correctly. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Calculation of `m`**:
   - The variable `m` is calculated as the product of all multipliers `k[i]`. For the input `3 3 3`, `m` is `3 * 3 * 3 = 27`.

2. **Calculation of `c`**:
   - The list `c` is calculated by dividing `m` by each multiplier `k[i]`. For the input `3 3 3`, `c` becomes `[27 / 3, 27 / 3, 27 / 3] = [9, 9, 9]`.

3. **Calculation of HCF**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c`. For `[9, 9, 9]`, the GCD is `9`.

4. **Normalization of `c`**:
   - Each element in `c` is then divided by the GCD. For `[9, 9, 9]`, after division by `9`, `c` becomes `[1, 1, 1]`.

5. **Sum Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of `c` is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`. For `c = [1, 1, 1]`, the sum is `3`, and `m / hcf` is `27 / 9 = 3`. The condition `sum(c) >= m / hcf` evaluates to `3 >= 3`, which is true. Therefore, the program prints `-1`.

6. **Correctness Issue**:
   - The problem requires that the total amount of coins received back for any winning outcome must be strictly greater than the total bet. For the input `3 3 3`, a valid solution exists where you can bet `1` coin on each outcome. The total bet is `3` coins, and if any outcome wins, you receive back `3 * 1 = 3` coins, which is not strictly greater than `3`. However, the program incorrectly concludes that no solution exists.

### Final Evaluation

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case where all multipliers are the same correctly, leading to an incorrect output of `-1` when a valid solution exists. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
