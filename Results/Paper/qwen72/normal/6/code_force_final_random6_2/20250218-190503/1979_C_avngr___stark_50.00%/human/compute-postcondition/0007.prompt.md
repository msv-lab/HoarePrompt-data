Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and k is a list of n integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20. `hcf` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `k`, which is `k[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for num in numbers[1:]:
    hcf = gcd(hcf, num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k` is a list of n integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the first element in the list `k` and the second element in the list `numbers`, `numbers` is a list with at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list `numbers`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k` is a list of n integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the first element in the list `k`, the second element in the list `numbers`, and the third element in the list `numbers`, `numbers` is a list with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list `numbers`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k` is a list of n integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the first element in the list `k`, the second element in the list `numbers`, the third element in the list `numbers`, and the fourth element in the list `numbers`, `numbers` is a list with at least 4 elements, `num` is the fourth element in the list `numbers`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
