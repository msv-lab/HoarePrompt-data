### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculation of Product `m`**:
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers `k[i]` and stores it in `m`. This is intended to find a common multiple that can be used to distribute the coins.
   - However, calculating the product of all multipliers can lead to very large numbers, which might not be necessary. A more efficient approach would be to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers. Despite this, the product `m` ensures that the bets are integers and can be used to find a valid distribution.

3. **Distributing Coins**:
   - The program then calculates the bets `c[i]` for each outcome as `m / k[i]`. This ensures that the total bet for each outcome, when multiplied by its respective multiplier, will be `m`.

4. **Finding the HCF (Highest Common Factor)**:
   - The program uses the `func_1` function to find the HCF of the bets `c`. This is done to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the same ratios.
   - The HCF calculation is correct and ensures that the bets are minimized while still satisfying the problem constraints.

5. **Checking the Sum of Bets**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the reduced bets `c` is less than `m / hcf`. If it is, the program outputs the bets; otherwise, it outputs `-1`.
   - This condition ensures that the total bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, which is the correct condition to meet the problem requirements.

6. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the bets for each test case, or `-1` if no valid distribution is possible.
   - The output format is correct and matches the problem description.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Correctness of the Logic**:
  - The logic of the program is fundamentally correct. It ensures that the total bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome by calculating the bets as `m / k[i]` and then reducing them by their HCF.
  - The condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` is the correct condition to check for a valid distribution.

- **Efficiency Concerns**:
  - The calculation of `m` as the product of all multipliers can lead to very large numbers, especially when `n` is large. This can be computationally expensive and might cause issues with integer overflow or performance.
  - A more efficient approach would be to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers instead of the product. However, the current approach is still correct and will work within the given constraints.

### Potential Issues:

- **Large Numbers**:
  - The product `m` can be very large, but since the constraints are relatively small (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), the program will not encounter integer overflow issues within Python's integer handling capabilities.
  - The large numbers might affect performance, but they do not affect the correctness of the solution.

- **HCF Calculation**:
  - The HCF calculation is correct and ensures that the bets are minimized while maintaining the required ratios.

- **Sum Check**:
  - The sum check is correct and ensures that the total bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

### Conclusion:

The program follows the correct logic to solve the problem. It ensures that the total bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, and it correctly handles the constraints and outputs the required results. The potential inefficiency in calculating `m` as the product of all multipliers does not affect the correctness of the solution, but it could be optimized for better performance.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the logic it follows. It ensures that the total bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, and it correctly handles the constraints and outputs the required results.

Final: **True**
