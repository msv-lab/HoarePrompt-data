Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `arr` must have at least three elements. `i` is 2. `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[2]`. If `new_segment` is not empty, and `arr[2] < 0`, `max_segment[0]` is further updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[1]`. If `new_segment` is not empty and `arr[2] >= 0`, `new_segment[0]` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[2]`. If `new_segment` is empty and `arr[2] >= 0`, `new_segment` is set to a list containing `arr[2]` and 2. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains an empty list or is not modified. `segments_variants` remains unchanged.***
