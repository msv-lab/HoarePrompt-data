Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `arr` must have at least two elements. `i` is 1. If `arr[1]` is negative, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[1]`, and `new_segment` remains an empty list. If `arr[1]` is zero or positive, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[1]`, and `new_segment[0]` is also increased by `arr[1]`. `segments_variants` is not affected by this code snippet.***
