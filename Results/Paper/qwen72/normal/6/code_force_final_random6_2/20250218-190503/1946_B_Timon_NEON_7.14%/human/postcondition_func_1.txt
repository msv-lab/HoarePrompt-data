The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the segment with the maximum sum from all possible contiguous subarrays of `arr`. The returned segment includes the sum of the subarray and the indices of the first and last elements of this subarray. If all sums of the contiguous subarrays are less than or equal to -1, the function returns `[-1]`. The input list `arr` remains unchanged.
