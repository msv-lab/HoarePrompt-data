Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `arr` must have at least two elements. `i` is 1. `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[1]`. If `new_segment` is True and `arr[1]` is zero or positive, `new_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[1]`. If `new_segment` is False and `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is a list containing the second element of `arr` and the integer 1. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains an empty list or is not modified. `segments_variants` is not affected by this code snippet.***
