Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `arr` remains a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr). `i` is `len(arr) - 1`. `max_segment` contains the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray. `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the current contiguous subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray. `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a contiguous subarray and the indices of the first and last elements of this subarray. `max_sum` remains -1, as it is not modified within the loop.**

Explanation:
- `arr` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify the elements of `arr`.
- `i` is the last index of `arr` after the loop completes, which is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `max_segment` is updated to reflect the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray found during the loop, and the index of the last element of this subarray.
- `new_segment` is updated to reflect the sum of the current contiguous subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray, or it remains an empty list if no new segment is formed.
- `segments_variants` is populated with lists of the form `[sum, start_index, end_index]` for each contiguous subarray that was considered during the loop.
- `max_sum` remains -1 as it is not modified within the loop.
