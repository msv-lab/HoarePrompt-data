Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `arr` must have at least two elements. `i` is 1. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` has a new element appended, which is a list containing the value of `max_segment` followed by `0`. Otherwise, `segments_variants` includes the list `new_segment + [0]`, and `max_segment` is equal to `new_segment`.***
