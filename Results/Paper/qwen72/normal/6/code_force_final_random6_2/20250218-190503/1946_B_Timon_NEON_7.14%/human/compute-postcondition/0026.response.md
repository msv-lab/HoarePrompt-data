Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `arr` must have at least two elements. `i` is 1. `segments_variants` has a new element appended, which is a list containing the value of `max_segment` followed by `0`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`, where the new list contains the elements of `max_segment` followed by the value of `i - 1`. Since `i` is 1, `i - 1` is 0. The values of `arr` and `i` remain unchanged.
