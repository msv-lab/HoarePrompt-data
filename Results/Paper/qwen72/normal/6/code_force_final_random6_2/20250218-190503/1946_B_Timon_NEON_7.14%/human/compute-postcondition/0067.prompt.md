Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` remains a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr). `i` is `len(arr) - 1`. `max_segment` contains the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray. `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the current contiguous subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray. `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a contiguous subarray and the indices of the first and last elements of this subarray, and now includes an additional list with the elements of `max_segment` plus the index `len(arr) - 1`. `max_sum` remains -1, as it is not modified within the loop. `total_max_segment` is now `[-1]`.
Code of the loop:
for segment in segments_variants:
    if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
        total_max_segment = segment


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` remains a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr)`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_segment` contains the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the current contiguous subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray, `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a contiguous subarray and the indices of the first and last elements of this subarray, and now includes an additional list with the elements of `max_segment` plus the index `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` remains -1, if the sum of the subarray represented by the first element in `segments_variants` is greater than -1, then `total_max_segment` is updated to the first element in `segments_variants`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains `[-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` remains a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr)`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_segment` contains the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the current contiguous subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray, `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a contiguous subarray and the indices of the first and last elements of this subarray, and now includes an additional list with the elements of `max_segment` plus the index `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` remains -1, `segment` is the next element in `segments_variants`. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, `total_max_segment` is updated to the value of `segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` remains a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr)`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_segment` contains the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the current contiguous subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray, `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a contiguous subarray and the indices of the first and last elements of this subarray, and now includes an additional list with the elements of `max_segment` plus the index `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` remains -1, `segment` is the next element in `segments_variants`. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, `total_max_segment` is updated to the value of `segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
