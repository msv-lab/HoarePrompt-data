Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input where the first `st` elements are all equal and the last two elements are equal, `l` is `st`, `r` is `n - 3`, `st` must be less than `n - 2`, `end` is 1, `ans` is calculated based on the conditions provided.**

The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so it is now `n - 3`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
