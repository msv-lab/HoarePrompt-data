Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `l` is less than `t - 1`, `r` is the largest index such that `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r - 1]` or `r` is `l`, `st` is the largest index such that `a[st] == a[st + 1]` for all `0 <= st < r`, `ans` is calculated based on the conditions provided.** 

The user input has been split and converted into a list of integers, updating the value of `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `st`, and `ans`) remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
