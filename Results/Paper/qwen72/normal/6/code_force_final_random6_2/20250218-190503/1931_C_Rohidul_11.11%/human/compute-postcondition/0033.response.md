Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is less than `t - 1`, `r` is the largest index such that `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r - 1]` or `r` is `l`, `st` is the largest index such that `a[st] == a[st + 1]` for all `0 <= st < r`, `end` is the number of times the loop executed. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, if `st` is 0, `end` is 0, and `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. If `st` is not 0, or `end` is not 0, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l`.***
