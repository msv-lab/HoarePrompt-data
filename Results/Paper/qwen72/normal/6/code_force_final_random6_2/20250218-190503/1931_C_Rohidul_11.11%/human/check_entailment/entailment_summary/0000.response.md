Reasoning:
The problem requires finding the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal by selecting a subarray and assigning a common value to its elements. The cost of this operation is the length of the selected subarray.

The provided program works as follows:
1. It processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
4. It then moves the left pointer `l` to the right as long as the elements at `l` and `l + 1` are the same, and similarly moves the right pointer `r` to the left as long as the elements at `r` and `r - 1` are the same. This effectively finds the longest prefix and suffix of consecutive equal elements.
5. It checks if the first and last elements of the array are the same. If they are, it calculates the cost as the length of the subarray between `l` and `r` (excluding the prefix and suffix).
6. If the first and last elements are different and there are no consecutive equal elements at the start or end, it calculates the cost as `n - 1` (assigning a common value to all elements except one).
7. Otherwise, it calculates the cost as the length of the subarray between `l` and `r`.
8. Finally, it prints the maximum of 0 and the calculated cost.

The logic of the program is correct for the given problem. It correctly identifies the longest prefix and suffix of consecutive equal elements and calculates the minimum cost to make the entire array equal. The edge cases, such as when the array is already equal or when there are no consecutive equal elements at the start or end, are also handled correctly.

Correctness: **True**
