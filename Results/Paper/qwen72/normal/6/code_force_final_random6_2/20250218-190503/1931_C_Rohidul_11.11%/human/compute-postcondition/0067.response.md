Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input where the first `st` elements are all equal and the last `end` elements are equal, `l` is `st`, `r` is `l`, `st` must be less than `n - end`, `end` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list, and the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`. If `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is 0, and either `st` is not 0, or `end` is not 0, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.***
