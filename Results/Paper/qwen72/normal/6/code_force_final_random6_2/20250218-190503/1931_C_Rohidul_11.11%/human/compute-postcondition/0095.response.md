Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `l` is less than `r - 1`, `r` is the largest index such that `a[r] == a[r - 1]` for all `0 <= l < r`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the beginning of the list `a` that are equal to `a[0]`, `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal to `a[-1]`, `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, and `ans` is 0.**
