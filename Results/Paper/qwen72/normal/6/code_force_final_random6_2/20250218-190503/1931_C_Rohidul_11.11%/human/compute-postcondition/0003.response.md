Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1.** 

The variables `l` and `r` have been initialized. `l` is set to 0, and `r` is set to `n` - 1, where `n` is equal to `t`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
