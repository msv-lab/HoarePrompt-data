Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that \(1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 500\) for all \(1 \leq i < n\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\), `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each \(1 \leq i < n-1\), `ans[i]` is the smallest multiple of `ans[i-1]` that is greater than `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]` if `ans[i]` is less than `arr[i]`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` remains as `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`. The final element `ans[n-1]` is `arr[n-2] + ans[n-2]` and is updated to the smallest multiple of `ans[n-2]` that is greater than `arr[n-2] + ans[n-2]` if `ans[n-1]` is less than `arr[n-1]`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations:
- The initial list `arr` remains unchanged.
- The list `ans` is updated such that:
  - The first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.
  - For each subsequent element `ans[i]` (where \(1 \leq i < n-1\)), `ans[i]` is calculated as `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]` and then adjusted to the smallest multiple of `ans[i-1]` that is greater than `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]` if `ans[i]` is less than `arr[i]`.
  - The last element `ans[n-1]` is initially set to `arr[n-2] + ans[n-2]` and then adjusted to the smallest multiple of `ans[n-2]` that is greater than `arr[n-2] + ans[n-2]` if `ans[n-1]` is less than `arr[n-1]`.
- The loop index `i` is `n-2` after the final iteration.
