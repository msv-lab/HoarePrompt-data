#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 1 <= i < n, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers such that \(1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 500\) for all \(1 \leq i < n\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\), `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each \(1 \leq i < n-1\), `ans[i]` is the smallest multiple of `ans[i-1]` that is greater than `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]` if `ans[i]` is less than `arr[i]`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` remains as `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`. The final element `ans[n-1]` is `arr[n-2] + ans[n-2]` and is updated to the smallest multiple of `ans[n-2]` that is greater than `arr[n-2] + ans[n-2]` if `ans[n-1]` is less than `arr[n-1]`.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of `n` integers, where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for \(1 \leq i < n-1\)) is the smallest multiple of `ans[i-1]` that is greater than `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]` if `ans[i]` is less than `arr[i]`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` remains as `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`. The final element `ans[n-1]` is updated to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of `n` integers where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`. For each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for \(1 \leq i < n-1\)), `ans[i]` is initially set to `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`. If `ans[i]` is less than `arr[i]`, it is updated to the smallest multiple of `ans[i-1]` that is greater than `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`. The final element `ans[n-1]` is set to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.
