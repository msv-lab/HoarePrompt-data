Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that \(1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 500\) for all \(1 \leq i < n\), `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 500\), `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `3 * arr[0] + 2 + arr[0] + 1`, and the rest of the elements in `ans` are zeros, `i` is 0, and `ans[1]` is less than `arr[1]`**

Explanation:
- The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates the value of `ans[1]` by adding `ans[0]` to it.
- Initially, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[1]` is `3 * arr[0] + 2`.
- After the code execution, `ans[1]` becomes `3 * arr[0] + 2 + arr[0] + 1`, which simplifies to `4 * arr[0] + 3`.
- The rest of the elements in `ans` remain zeros.
- The values of `arr`, `n`, and `i` are unchanged.
- The condition `ans[1]` is less than `arr[1]` is still valid.
