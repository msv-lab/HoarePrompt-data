Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers such that \(1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 500\) for all \(1 \leq i < n\), `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 500\), `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`. If `ans[1]` is less than `arr[1]`, then `ans[1]` is updated to `arr[1]`. Otherwise, `ans[1]` remains `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`. The rest of the elements in `ans` are zeros, and `i` is 0.***
