The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `n`. `arr` is a list of integers where each element `arr[i]` satisfies \(1 \leq arr[i] \leq 500\) for all \(1 \leq i < n\), and `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\).

The function returns a list `ans` of `n` integers, where:
- The first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.
- For each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for \(1 \leq i < n-1\)):
  - `ans[i]` is the smallest multiple of `ans[i-1]` that is greater than `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]` if `ans[i]` is less than `arr[i]`.
  - Otherwise, `ans[i]` remains as `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`.
- The final element `ans[n-1]` is updated to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of `n` integers where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, and each subsequent element is either the smallest multiple of the previous element that is greater than the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element in `arr`, or the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element in `arr`, depending on the condition. The last element in `ans` is the sum of the second-to-last element in `ans` and the last element in `arr`.**
