Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 1`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**. 

The variables `n` and `d` remain unchanged, but `v` and `u` are now assigned the values returned by the function `func_1` when called with the argument `d`. The specific values of `v` and `u` depend on the implementation of `func_1`.
