Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except the new values of `v` and `u` if `u` was in `remaining_vertices`. `d` is `n - 3`, `v` and `u` are the new values returned by `func_1(d)`, `v` is not 0, and `remaining_vertices` must not be empty. The program continues with the current values of `v` and `u`.**
