The only objects in the loop head are the variable `d` and the range parameters, which are derived from `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing `d` by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is `n - 1`, and the loop will continue to execute if `d` is greater than or equal to `0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `d` is `n - 1`.
- The loop will execute again if `d` is greater than or equal to `0`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `d` will be decremented by 1, so it will be `n - 2`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `d` is greater than or equal to `0`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. If `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, `path` now contains `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` and `u` if `u` was in `remaining_vertices`. `d` is `n - 2`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`, `v` is not 0, and `remaining_vertices` must not be empty. If `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
