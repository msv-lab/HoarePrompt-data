Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. `d` is 0, and the loop has either added a value to `path` and removed it from `remaining_vertices` or has not added any value to `path` and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `d` will be 0, indicating that the loop has completed its full range from `n-1` down to 0. The `path` list may or may not contain a value `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` and is not 0, depending on whether the loop found such a value and added it to `path`. If a value `v` was added to `path`, it will have been removed from `remaining_vertices`. If no such value was found, `remaining_vertices` will still contain all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except for any value `v` that might have been in `path` from the initial state. The loop will have stopped either because it found a value `v` in `remaining_vertices` and added it to `path`, or because it exhausted all iterations without finding such a value.
