Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is a list that may contain at most one value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `remaining_vertices` must not be empty, `d` is `n - 1`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Additionally, `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.**
