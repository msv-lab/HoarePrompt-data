Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 2`, `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains `v`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 3`, `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` and `u` are the new values returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` now contains the value `v`, and `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the loop skips the rest of its body and immediately starts the next iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
