Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 2`, `path` is a list that contains the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation:
- The value `v` is appended to the list `path`.
- If `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `path` now contains `v`.
- The values of `n`, `d`, `remaining_vertices`, and `u` remain unchanged.
- If `v` is 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration, but since the code snippet only contains the `path.append(v)` statement, the state remains the same as the initial state.
