To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `d` and `n`. The loop is defined as `for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1)`, which means `d` will start at `n - 1` and decrement by 1 until it reaches -1 (but not including -1).

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5
- `path` is an empty list
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive)

For the loop to execute:
- `n` must be at least 2 (since the loop starts at `n - 1` and `n` must be greater than 1 for `n - 1` to be a valid starting point).
- `d` must be initialized to `n - 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive)**
