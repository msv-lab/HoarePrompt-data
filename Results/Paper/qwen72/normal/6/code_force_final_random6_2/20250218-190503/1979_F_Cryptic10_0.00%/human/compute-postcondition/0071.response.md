Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 2`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The current iteration of the loop is skipped. The states of `path` and `remaining_vertices` are not affected.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to be skipped, moving directly to the next iteration. This means that no changes are made to the variables `path` and `remaining_vertices`. The values of `n`, `d`, `v`, and `u` remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.
