To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions present in the loop head. The loop head is:
```
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
```
This loop will iterate over values of `d` starting from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, the range must contain at least one value. This means that `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head:**
   - `d`
   - `n`

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than or equal to `0`.
   - This simplifies to `n` being greater than or equal to `1`.

3. **Check the given state:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - This condition already ensures that `n` is at least 2, which is greater than 1. Therefore, the loop will execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the state if necessary:**
   - Since `n` is already guaranteed to be at least 2, no adjustment is needed for `n`.
   - The variable `d` will start at `n - 1` and decrement to `0`.

5. **Final state:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `d` is initialized to `n - 1`.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should be:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 1`**
