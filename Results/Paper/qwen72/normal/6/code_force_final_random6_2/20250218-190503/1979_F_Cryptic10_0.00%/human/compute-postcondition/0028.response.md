Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 3`, `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` and `u` are the new values returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` now contains the value `v`, and `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the loop skips the rest of its body and immediately starts the next iteration.***
