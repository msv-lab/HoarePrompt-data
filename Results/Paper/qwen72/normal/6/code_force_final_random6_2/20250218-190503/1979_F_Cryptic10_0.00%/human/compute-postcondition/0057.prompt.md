Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is a list that may contain at most one value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, and `remaining_vertices` must not be empty. `d` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. If `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, `path` now contains `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` and `u` if `u` was in `remaining_vertices`. `d` is `n - 1`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`, `v` is not 0, and `remaining_vertices` must not be empty. If `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` and `u` if `u` was in `remaining_vertices`. `d` is `n - 2`, `v` and `u` are the new values returned by `func_1(d)`, `v` is not 0, and `remaining_vertices` must not be empty. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is added to `path`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `v` and `u`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except the new values of `v` and `u` if `u` was in `remaining_vertices`. `d` is `n - 3`, `v` and `u` are the new values returned by `func_1(d)`, `v` is not 0, and `remaining_vertices` must not be empty. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is added to `path`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the program continues with the current values of `v` and `u`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
