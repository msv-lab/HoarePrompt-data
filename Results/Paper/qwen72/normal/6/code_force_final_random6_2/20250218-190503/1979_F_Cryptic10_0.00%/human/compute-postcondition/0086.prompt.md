Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive).
Code of the loop:
while remaining_vertices:
    for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        v, u = func_1(d)
        if v == 0:
            continue
        if v in remaining_vertices:
            path.append(v)
            remaining_vertices.remove(v)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is a list that may contain at most one value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. `d` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. `d` is 0, and the loop has either added a value to `path` and removed it from `remaining_vertices` or has not added any value to `path` and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is 0, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(0)`. If `v` is not 0 and is in the `remaining_vertices` list, `v` is appended to the `path` list and removed from the `remaining_vertices` list, with `v` as the last element of `path` and `v` no longer in `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is 0 or was not in the `remaining_vertices` list, the states of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
