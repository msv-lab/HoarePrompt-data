Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `lst[x]` is now one element shorter, `s` is False. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
