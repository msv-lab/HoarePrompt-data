Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u_1 is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, x and y are integers provided by the user, `lst` is a defaultdict with lists as default values.**

The code initializes `lst` as a defaultdict with lists as the default values. This means that `lst` will automatically create a list when a new key is accessed. The values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `u_1`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
