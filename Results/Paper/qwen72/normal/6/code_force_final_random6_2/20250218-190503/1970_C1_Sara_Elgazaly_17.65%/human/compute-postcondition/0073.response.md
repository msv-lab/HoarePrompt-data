Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is the last value of `y` that was not an empty list in `lst`, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the loop terminated, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `lst[x]` is now empty, `s` is the negation of the initial state of `s` (i.e., if `s` was True initially, it will be False, and vice versa).**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `t` remains 1.
- The values of `u` and `v` remain unchanged.
- The value of `u_1` remains unchanged.
- The value of `x` will be the last value of `y` that was not an empty list in `lst` before the loop terminated.
- The value of `y` will be the last element of `lst[x]` before the loop terminated.
- The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- The list `lst[x]` will be empty.
- The value of `s` will be the opposite of its initial state (i.e., if `s` was initially True, it will be False, and if it was initially False, it will be True).
