Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is an integer provided by the user and must be greater than 1, `y` is an integer provided by the user, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as the last element, `lst[b]` now contains `a` as the last element and `a` as the new last element.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `a` and `b`.
- The previous values of `a` and `b` are replaced by the new values provided by the user.
- The initial state information for `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `u_1`, `x`, `y`, and the contents of `lst` remain unchanged.
