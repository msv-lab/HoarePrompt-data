Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `lst[x]` is now one element shorter but not empty, `s` is False.**

Explanation:
- The code `y = lst[x].pop()` assigns the last element of `lst[x]` to `y` and then removes that element from `lst[x]`.
- The value of `y` is now the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation.
- The list `lst[x]` is now one element shorter but is still not empty.
- All other variables (`n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `u_1`, `a`, `b`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
