Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is the last value of `y` that was not an empty list in `lst`, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the loop terminated, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `lst[x]` is now empty, `s` is True.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `lst[x]` is not empty.
- Each iteration, the last element of `lst[x]` is popped and assigned to `y`.
- If `lst[y]` is not empty, `x` is updated to `y` and the loop breaks.
- If `lst[y]` is empty, the loop continues to the next iteration.
- After all iterations, `x` will be the last value of `y` that was not an empty list in `lst`.
- `y` will be the last element of `lst[x]` before the loop terminated.
- `lst[x]` will be empty because all elements have been popped.
- The values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `u_1`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The value of `s` remains True.
