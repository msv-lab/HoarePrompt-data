Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is equal to the last element of `lst[x]` before the execution, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the execution, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `lst[x]` now contains one less element than before, `s` is True, `lst[y]` is not an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
