Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `lst[x]` is now one element shorter but not empty, `s` is False, and `x` is now equal to `y`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be the same as the value of `y`, which is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
