Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `p` is a list where the first element is `n` and the rest are zeros except `p[2]` which is `n - 2`, `ind` is equal to `n - 4`.**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is decremented by 2, so `ind` is now `n - 4`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `p`) remain unchanged.
