The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration and continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 2, making it 2. Additionally, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 2 (since the loop condition is `i < n` and `i` will be 2).

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `p[0]` is `ind - 2`**
