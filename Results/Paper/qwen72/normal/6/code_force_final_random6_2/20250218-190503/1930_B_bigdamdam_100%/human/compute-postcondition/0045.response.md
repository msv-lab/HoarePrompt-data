Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `p[1]` is set to `ind`, `p[3]` is set to `ind + 2`, `ind` is increased by 2.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` to the element at index `i` in the list `p`. Given that `i` is 3 and `ind` is increased by 2, the new value of `ind` is `ind + 2`. Therefore, `p[3]` is set to `ind + 2`. The initial state information that `n` must be greater than 3 and `p[1]` is set to `ind` remains unchanged.
