To determine what will be printed by the `print(*p)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the structure of the list `p`:

1. **Initial State:**
   - The loop has completed all iterations.
   - `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd, or `n-2` if `n` is even.
   - `p` is a list where:
     - `p[0]` is `n`.
     - `p[2]` is `n-2`.
     - `p[4]` is `n-4`.
     - And so on, with all even indices filled with decreasing values starting from `n` and decreasing by 2.
   - All odd indices from `1` to `n-1` (if `n` is odd) or `n-2` (if `n` is even) are filled with consecutive even numbers starting from `ind` (which was 1 if `n` is odd, and 2 if `n` is even).
   - `ind` is the next even number after the last filled odd index.

2. **Understanding the List `p`:**
   - The list `p` is constructed such that:
     - Even indices: `p[0] = n`, `p[2] = n-2`, `p[4] = n-4`, and so on.
     - Odd indices: `p[1] = ind`, `p[3] = ind + 2`, `p[5] = ind + 4`, and so on, where `ind` is 1 if `n` is odd and 2 if `n` is even.

3. **Constructing the List `p` for Different Values of `n`:**
   - If `n` is odd:
     - `p[0] = n`
     - `p[2] = n-2`
     - `p[4] = n-4`
     - ...
     - `p[1] = 1`
     - `p[3] = 3`
     - `p[5] = 5`
     - ...
   - If `n` is even:
     - `p[0] = n`
     - `p[2] = n-2`
     - `p[4] = n-4`
     - ...
     - `p[1] = 2`
     - `p[3] = 4`
     - `p[5] = 6`
     - ...

4. **Example Construction:**
   - For `n = 5` (odd):
     - `p[0] = 5`
     - `p[2] = 3`
     - `p[4] = 1`
     - `p[1] = 1`
     - `p[3] = 3`
     - `p = [5, 1, 3, 3, 1]`
   - For `n = 6` (even):
     - `p[0] = 6`
     - `p[2] = 4`
     - `p[4] = 2`
     - `p[1] = 2`
     - `p[3] = 4`
     - `p[5] = 6`
     - `p = [6, 2, 4, 4, 2, 6]`

5. **General Pattern:**
   - For an odd `n`, the list `p` will have the form: `[n, 1, n-2, 3, n-4, 5, ..., 1, n-1]`.
   - For an even `n`, the list `p` will have the form: `[n, 2, n-2, 4, n-4, 6, ..., 2, n-2]`.

6. **Output of `print(*p)`:**
   - The `print(*p)` statement will print all elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

Output: **[n, 1, n-2, 3, n-4, 5, ..., 1, n-1] if n is odd, or [n, 2, n-2, 4, n-4, 6, ..., 2, n-2] if n is even (where n is the given value of n, and the elements are separated by spaces)**.
