Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
2. For all odd indices `i` in the list `p`:
   - `p[i]` is set to `i + n % 2`.
3. `ind` is increased by `2 * (n // 2)` if `n` is even, or `2 * ((n - 1) // 2)` if `n` is odd.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the length of `p`**:
   - The list `p` is not explicitly defined, but we can infer that it must be at least as long as the highest odd index mentioned in the precondition.
   - If `n` is even, the highest odd index is `n-2`.
   - If `n` is odd, the highest odd index is `n-1`.

2. **Set the values of `p`**:
   - For each odd index `i` in `p`, the value `p[i]` is set to `i + n % 2`.
   - `n % 2` will be 0 if `n` is even, and 1 if `n` is odd.
   - Therefore, for even `n`, `p[i]` will be `i` for all odd `i`.
   - For odd `n`, `p[i]` will be `i + 1` for all odd `i`.

3. **Determine the final value of `ind`**:
   - If `n` is even, `ind` is increased by `2 * (n // 2)`, which simplifies to `n`.
   - If `n` is odd, `ind` is increased by `2 * ((n - 1) // 2)`, which simplifies to `n - 1`.

### Example Calculations:
- **If `n` is even (e.g., `n = 4`)**:
  - `p[1]` = `1 + 4 % 2` = `1 + 0` = `1`
  - `p[3]` = `3 + 4 % 2` = `3 + 0` = `3`
  - `ind` = `2 * (4 // 2)` = `2 * 2` = `4`
  - The list `p` will be `[p[0], 1, p[2], 3, p[4]]` (assuming `p` is long enough to have these indices).

- **If `n` is odd (e.g., `n = 5`)**:
  - `p[1]` = `1 + 5 % 2` = `1 + 1` = `2`
  - `p[3]` = `3 + 5 % 2` = `3 + 1` = `4`
  - `p[5]` = `5 + 5 % 2` = `5 + 1` = `6`
  - `ind` = `2 * ((5 - 1) // 2)` = `2 * (4 // 2)` = `2 * 2` = `4`
  - The list `p` will be `[p[0], 2, p[2], 4, p[4], 6, p[6]]` (assuming `p` is long enough to have these indices).

### General Output:
- The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.
- For even `n`, the elements at odd indices will be the index itself.
- For odd `n`, the elements at odd indices will be the index plus 1.

### Final Output:
- If `n` is even, the output will be the elements of `p` at odd indices, which are the indices themselves.
- If `n` is odd, the output will be the elements of `p` at odd indices, which are the indices plus 1.

Output: **1, 3, 5, ..., n-3, n-1 (if n is even) or 2, 4, 6, ..., n-2, n (if n is odd)**

This output is based on the given precondition and the structure of the list `p` as described.
