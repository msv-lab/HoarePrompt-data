The objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, and `i` starts from 1 and increments by 2. Given that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, the loop will execute at least once. The initial state of `i` is already correctly set to start from 1, which is the first value the loop will use. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `i` or `n` to ensure the loop executes.

However, the state of `ind` is not relevant to the loop head, and `p` is an array that is not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1**
