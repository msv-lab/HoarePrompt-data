The code snippet `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` to the element at index `i` in the list `p`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the second element of `p` (index 1) is set to `ind`. The value of `ind` is not specified, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, the value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `p[1]` is set to `ind`.**
