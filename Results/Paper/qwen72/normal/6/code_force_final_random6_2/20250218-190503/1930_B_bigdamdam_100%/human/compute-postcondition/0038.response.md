Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 4, `p[2]` is now equal to `ind - 4`, `ind` is now `ind - 4`, `p[4]` is now equal to `ind - 2`**

Explanation:
- `ind` is decremented by 2, so its new value is `ind - 4`.
- `p[2]` was previously equal to `ind - 2`, and since `ind` has been updated to `ind - 4`, `p[2]` is now equal to `ind - 4`.
- `p[4]` was previously equal to `ind`, and since `ind` has been updated to `ind - 4`, `p[4]` is now equal to `ind - 2`.
- The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
