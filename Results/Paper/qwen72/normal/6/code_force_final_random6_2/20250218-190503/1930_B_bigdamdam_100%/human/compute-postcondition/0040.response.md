Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `p[0]` to `p[n-1]` are filled with values starting from `n` and decreasing by 2, `ind` is now `1 + n % 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is updated to `1 + n % 2`. The initial value of `ind` was `n - 2 * (n // 2)`, but this value is no longer relevant after the code execution. The other conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
