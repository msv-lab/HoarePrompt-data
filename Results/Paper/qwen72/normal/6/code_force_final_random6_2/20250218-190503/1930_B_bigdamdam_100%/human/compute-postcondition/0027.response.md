Output State: **`n` is the first integer value from the input, `i` is `n + 1` if the new `n` is even or `n` if the new `n` is odd, `p` is a list where every even-indexed element (starting from 0) is filled with values decreasing by 2 starting from the new `n` down to `n - (n // 2) * 2`, and every odd-indexed element (starting from 1) is filled with values starting from 1 or 2 (depending on whether the new `n` is odd or even) and increasing by 2, `ind` is the new `n` if the new `n` is even or `n + 1` if the new `n` is odd, `m` must be greater than the new `i`.**
