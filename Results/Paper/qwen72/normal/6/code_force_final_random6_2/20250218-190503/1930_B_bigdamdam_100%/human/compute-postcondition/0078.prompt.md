Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
    p = [0] * n
    ind = n
    for i in range(0, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind -= 2
    ind = 1 + n % 2
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind += 2
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n` if `n` is even or `n - 1` if `n` is odd, `p` is a list where every even-indexed element (starting from 0) is filled with values decreasing by 2 starting from `n` down to `n - (n // 2) * 2`, and every odd-indexed element (starting from 1) is filled with values starting from 1 or 2 (depending on whether `n` is odd or even) and increasing by 2, `ind` is `n` if `n` is even or `n + 1` if `n` is odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `p[1]` is set to `1 + n % 2`, `p[3]` is set to `3 + n % 2`, `p[5]` is set to `5 + n % 2`, and so on for all odd indices up to `n-1` if `n` is odd or `n-2` if `n` is even. `ind` is increased by `2 * (n // 2)` if `n` is even, or `2 * ((n - 1) // 2)` if `n` is odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd, or `n-2` if `n` is even, `p` is a list where `p[0]` is `n`, `p[2]` is `n-2`, `p[4]` is `n-4`, and so on, with all even indices filled with decreasing values starting from `n` and decreasing by 2. All odd indices from `1` to `n-1` (if `n` is odd) or `n-2` (if `n` is even) are filled with consecutive even numbers starting from `ind` (which was 1 if `n` is odd, and 2 if `n` is even), and `ind` is the next even number after the last filled odd index.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
