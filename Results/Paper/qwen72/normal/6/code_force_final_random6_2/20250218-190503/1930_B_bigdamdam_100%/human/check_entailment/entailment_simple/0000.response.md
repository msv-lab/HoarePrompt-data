### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` using `n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]`.
   - This part is correct and follows the problem's input format.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The function initializes a list `p` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It then fills the even indices of `p` with the largest odd numbers and the largest even number, starting from `n` and decreasing by 2.
   - After filling the even indices, it fills the odd indices with the smallest odd and even numbers, starting from 1 or 2 (depending on whether `n` is odd or even) and increasing by 2.

3. **Validation of Permutation:**
   - The constructed permutation `p` should ensure that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) exist such that `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]`.
   - By filling even indices with large numbers and odd indices with small numbers, the function ensures that the conditions are met. This is because large numbers are less likely to divide smaller numbers, and the pattern of alternating large and small numbers helps avoid the division condition.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the constructed permutation `p` for each test case.
   - This part is correct and follows the problem's output format.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Even Indices:**
  - For even indices, the function starts from `n` and fills them with decreasing values by 2. This ensures that the largest numbers are placed at even indices.
  - For example, if `n = 4`, the even indices are filled as `p[0] = 4` and `p[2] = 2`.

- **Odd Indices:**
  - For odd indices, the function starts from `1 + n % 2` and fills them with increasing values by 2. This ensures that the smallest numbers are placed at odd indices.
  - For example, if `n = 4`, the odd indices are filled as `p[1] = 1` and `p[3] = 3`.

- **Example Verification:**
  - For `n = 4`, the permutation `p = [4, 1, 2, 3]` is constructed.
  - For `n = 3`, the permutation `p = [1, 2, 3]` is constructed.
  - Both permutations are valid according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a permutation for each test case that meets the problem's requirements. The logic ensures that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` exist such that `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]`.
