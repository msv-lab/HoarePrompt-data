Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `p` is a list where the first element is `n` and the rest are zeros, `ind` is equal to `n - 2`.**

The value of `ind` is decreased by 2, so it is now `n - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
