Output State: **`i` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans_f` is a list of `t` integers, each representing the sum of the minimum values of pairs of integers from the corresponding `lst` until `lst` has 2 or fewer elements. `lst` is a list with 2 or fewer elements remaining for each iteration, and the loop has completed all `t` iterations.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations:
- The variable `i` will be `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times.
- The variable `n` will still be an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, as it is re-assigned in each iteration.
- The list `ans_f` will contain `t` integers, where each integer is the sum of the minimum values of pairs of integers from the corresponding `lst` until `lst` has 2 or fewer elements.
- For each iteration, the list `lst` will have 2 or fewer elements remaining, as the loop removes elements in pairs until this condition is met.
- The loop will have completed all `t` iterations, meaning that the loop has processed all `t` inputs.
