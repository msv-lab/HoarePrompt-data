Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `t` must be greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans`, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` added to the initial `ans` value (which was 0), and the second element of `lst` has been removed.**

Explanation:
- The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 (since `1 * 2` equals 2) from the list `lst`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, and `t` are not affected.
- The value of `ans` and the list `ans_f` remain unchanged.
- The second element of `lst` has been removed, so the list `lst` is now one element shorter, and the elements after the removed one will shift one position to the left.
