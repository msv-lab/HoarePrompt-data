Output State: **`i` is `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans` is 0, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list that now includes the value of the previous `ans`, `t` must be greater than `n * 2`, `l` is an input string.**

The code `lst = l.split(' ')` updates the `lst` variable to be a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string `l` at each space character. The other variables remain unchanged.
