The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 (since `1 * 2` is 2) from the list `lst`. The length of `lst` will be decreased by 1, and the other variables (`i`, `n`, and `ans`) are not directly affected by this code.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, the length of `lst` is decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers, the element at index 2 of `lst` has been removed.**
