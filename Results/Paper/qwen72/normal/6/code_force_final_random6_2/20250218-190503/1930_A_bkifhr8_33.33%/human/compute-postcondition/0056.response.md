The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 (third element) from the list `lst`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans` is the sum of the minimum of the first two integers in `lst` and the previous `ans`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first and third elements of `lst` have been removed, and `ans` is the minimum of the remaining first two integers. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the minimum of the integers obtained from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans_f` is a list that now includes the value of the updated `ans`, `t` must be greater than `n * 2`, `l` is an input string, and the first and third elements of `lst` have been removed.**
