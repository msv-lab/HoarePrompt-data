To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, let's analyze the initial state step by step:

1. **Variable `i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is assigned the value of `ans_f[t]`. This means `i` will hold the integer value at index `t` in the list `ans_f`.

2. **Variable `n`**: `n` is an input integer with a range of 1 to 50. However, `n` is not directly used in the `print` statement, so its value does not affect the output of the `print(i)` statement.

3. **List `ans_f`**: `ans_f` is a list of `t + 1` integers, where `t` must be greater than 0. This means `ans_f` has at least 2 elements (since `t` is greater than 0).

4. **Index `t`**: `t` is an integer that is greater than 0. Therefore, `t` is a valid index for the list `ans_f`, which has `t + 1` elements.

Given this information, when the `print(i)` statement is executed, it will print the integer value at index `t` in the list `ans_f`.

Output: **ans_f[t] (where ans_f[t] is the integer value at index t in the list ans_f)**
