Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans` is the sum of the minimum of the first two integers in `lst` and the previous `ans`, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string `l` by spaces. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first and third elements (index 2) of `lst` are removed, and `ans` is the sum of the minimum of the remaining first two integers and the previous `ans`. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the sum of the minimum of the integers obtained from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` and the previous `ans`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans_f` is a list that now includes the value of the previous `ans`, `t` must be greater than `n * 2`, and `l` is an input string.**
