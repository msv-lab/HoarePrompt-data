Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 50, a is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, ans_f is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    ans = 0
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = l.split(' ')
    for i in range(n * 2):
        if len(lst) != 2:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
            lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
        else:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            break
    ans_f.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n * 2 - 1`, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans` is the sum of the minimum of pairs of integers from `lst` until `lst` has 2 or fewer elements, `lst` has 2 or fewer elements remaining, `ans_f` is a list that now includes the value of `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of the first two integers in `lst` for each iteration until `lst` has 2 or fewer elements, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string `l` by spaces, with elements removed in pairs until 2 or fewer elements remain, `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans`, `t` must be greater than `n * 2`, and `l` is an input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n * 2 - 1`, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans` and the previous values of `ans` that were appended to `ans_f`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of the first two elements of `lst` (converted to integers) for each iteration, and elements at positions 0, 2, 4, ..., `n * 2 - 2` have been removed from `lst`. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` and `lst` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
