Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is now `t - 1`, `R` is a function that reads a line of input and returns an iterator of integers, `k` is the last integer in the iterator returned by `R()` and must be at least 1, `a` is a set containing integers read from the input for the current test case, `b` is a set containing integers read from the input for the current test case, `f` is 1, `m` is equal to `k // 2`, `n` is equal to `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `u` is `True` if `1` is in `a`, otherwise `u` is `False`, `v` is `True` if `1` is in `b`, otherwise `v` is `False`.**
