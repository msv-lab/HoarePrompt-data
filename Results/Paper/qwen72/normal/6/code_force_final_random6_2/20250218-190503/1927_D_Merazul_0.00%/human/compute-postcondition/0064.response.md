Output State: **`t` is `t - 3` and must be at least 1, `R` is a function that reads a line of input and returns an iterator of integers, `k` is the last integer in the iterator returned by `R()` and must be at least 1, `a` is a set containing integers read from the input for the current test case, `b` is a set containing integers read from the input for the current test case (updated with the new set of integers from `R()`), `f` is `1`, `m` is `k // 2`, `n` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k`, `u` is `True` if `k` is in `a`, otherwise `False`, `v` is `True` if `k` is in `b`, otherwise `False`.**
