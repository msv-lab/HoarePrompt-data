### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding a pair of indices (i, j) within a specified range [l, r] such that the elements at these indices are different.
   - If no such pair exists, the program should output -1 -1.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an array and multiple queries.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `k`, the array `a`, and the number of queries `q`.
   - The program then reads the queries and processes them.

3. **Issues in the Program**:
   - **Input Parsing**:
     - The program uses `R = lambda : map(int, input().split())` to read input.
     - The first line of each test case should read the length of the array `n`, but the program reads `k` which is the number of queries.
     - The second line should read the array `a`, but the program reads `a` as a set, which loses the order of elements.
     - The third line should read the number of queries `q`, but the program reads `b` as a set, which is not used in the problem.
   - **Logic**:
     - The program uses a loop to check if each integer from 1 to `k` is in either set `a` or set `b`.
     - This logic is incorrect because it does not check the elements within the specified range [l, r] for each query.
     - The program also uses bitwise operations to determine the output, which does not match the problem's requirements of finding indices.

4. **Expected Logic**:
   - For each query, the program should check the subarray `a[l-1:r]` to find two different elements.
   - If such elements are found, it should output their indices.
   - If no such elements are found, it should output -1 -1.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It has issues with input parsing and the logic used to find the required indices.

**Correctness: False**
