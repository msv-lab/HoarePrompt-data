### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires processing multiple test cases, each with an array and a set of queries.
   - For each query, we need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) within the given range \([l, r]\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\).
   - If no such pair exists, we should output \(-1 -1\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program does not match the problem description. Let's break it down:
     - The function `R` is defined to read integers from input and map them to integers.
     - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `k` and two sets `a` and `b`.
     - It then iterates from 1 to `k` and performs some bitwise operations on variables `u`, `v`, `m`, and `n`.
     - Finally, it prints a string based on the result of these operations.

3. **Mismatch with Problem Description**:
   - The program reads two sets `a` and `b` instead of an array `a` and a list of queries.
   - The program does not handle the queries as described in the problem.
   - The logic involving `u`, `v`, `m`, and `n` does not seem to be related to finding pairs of different elements in the array.
   - The output format is also incorrect; it prints a string "YES" or "NO" instead of the required indices or \(-1 -1\).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not solve the problem as described. It appears to be solving a different problem or is a partial implementation that is not complete or correct for the given task.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It reads input in a different format and performs operations that do not align with the task of finding pairs of different elements in a subarray for each query.
