Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where:
  - `hh` is an integer from 00 to 23.
  - `mm` is an integer from 00 to 59.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 1.
- `h` and `m` are integers derived from the input string `s`.
- If `h` is 0, `h` is updated to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'.
- If `h` > 12, `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'.
- If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'AM'.
- Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Extract `h` and `m` from `s`**:
   - The string `s` is in the format "hh:mm".
   - `h` is the integer value of the first two characters of `s`.
   - `m` is the integer value of the last two characters of `s`.

2. **Determine the value of `day` based on `h`**:
   - If `h` is 0, `h` is updated to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - If `h` > 12, `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.

3. **Format the output**:
   - The `print` statement will format `h` and `m` as two-digit numbers (with leading zeros if necessary).
   - It will then print the formatted time followed by the value of `day`.

### Example Scenarios:
- If `s` is "00:30":
  - `h` = 0, `m` = 30.
  - Since `h` is 0, `h` is updated to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'.
  - Output: **12:30 AM**.

- If `s` is "13:45":
  - `h` = 13, `m` = 45.
  - Since `h` > 12, `h` is updated to 13 - 12 = 1 and `day` is set to 'PM'.
  - Output: **01:45 PM**.

- If `s` is "12:00":
  - `h` = 12, `m` = 00.
  - Since `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'AM'.
  - Output: **12:00 AM**.

- If `s` is "09:15":
  - `h` = 9, `m` = 15.
  - Since `h` is neither 0, 12, nor > 12, `day` remains 'PM'.
  - Output: **09:15 PM**.

### General Output:
Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be the formatted time in 12-hour format followed by 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `h`.

Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day} (where {h:02d} is the formatted hour, {m:02d} is the formatted minute, and {day} is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions described)**.
