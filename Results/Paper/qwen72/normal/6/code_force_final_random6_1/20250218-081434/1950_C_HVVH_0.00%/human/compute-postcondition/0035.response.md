Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `h` is `h - 12`, `m` are integers derived from the input string `s`, `day` is not yet set.**

Explanation:
- The value of `h` is updated to `h - 12`.
- All other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `_`, `m`, and `day`) remain unchanged.
- The format of `s` and the range of `t` are still valid.
- `n` is still greater than 0.
- `_` is still 2.
- `m` is still derived from the input string `s`.
- `day` is still not set.
