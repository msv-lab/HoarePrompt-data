Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. This is correct as per the problem description.
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `n` times, each time reading a time string in the format `hh:mm`. This is also correct.
3. **Time Conversion**:
   - The program splits the input string into `h` (hours) and `m` (minutes) using `input().split(':')` and converts them to integers. This is correct.
   - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'. This is correct because 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'. This is correct because hours from 13 to 23 in 24-hour format should be converted to 1 to 11 in 12-hour format with 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, it sets `day` to 'AM'. This is incorrect because 12:00 in 24-hour format should be 12:00 PM in 12-hour format, not AM.
   - For hours from 1 to 11, it sets `day` to 'PM'. This is incorrect because these hours should be 'AM' in the 12-hour format.

4. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the time in the format `'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}'`, which ensures leading zeros are preserved and the time is correctly formatted. This is correct.

Given the issues in the time conversion logic, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
