Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal by selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to a single value. The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray.

The provided function `func_1` attempts to solve the problem by checking if the array is a palindrome. If it is, the function returns 0, indicating no cost is needed because the array is already symmetric and can be made equal by setting the middle element (or no operation if the array is already equal).

However, the function's logic for non-palindromic arrays is flawed. It only considers the first pair of non-matching elements from the start and end of the array and then increments the starting index `i` to skip over consecutive equal elements. This approach does not correctly handle all cases where the array can be made equal with a single operation.

For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 2, 1]`. This array is not a palindrome, but it can be made equal by setting the middle two elements to 1 or 2, which would cost 2 burles. The function, however, would return 3 burles, which is incorrect.

Additionally, the function does not consider the optimal value `x` to set the subarray to. The optimal value should be the most frequent element in the array, as setting all elements to this value would minimize the cost.

Therefore, the function `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
