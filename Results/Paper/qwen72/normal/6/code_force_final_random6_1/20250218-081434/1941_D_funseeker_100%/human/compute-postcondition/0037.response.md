The value `(q + r) % n` is added to the set `temp`. The initial state indicates that `temp` already contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '1', `temp` might not have contained these values initially, but now it definitely contains `(q + r) % n`.

Output State: **`ans` is a set containing at least one unique value of `(q + r) % n` or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. `q` is the next element of `ans`, `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 1, `r` is the first element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space and is now an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space, and `c` is either '0', '1', or '?'.**
