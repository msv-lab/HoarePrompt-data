Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '1', `ans` contains all unique values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`. `m` must be greater than 1, `r` is the first element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space, `r` is now an integer, `temp` is an empty set.**
