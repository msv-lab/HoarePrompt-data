Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the current player number becomes 0 after a counterclockwise throw. According to the problem description, player numbers are 1-indexed, so a player number of 0 is invalid. The program should adjust the player number to be within the valid range (1 to n) by adding n to the result if it becomes 0 or negative.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 1 1
2 1
```
Here, n = 5, m = 1, and x = 1. The ball is initially with player 1. The first throw is a counterclockwise throw with a distance of 2. The correct player number after this throw should be 4 (since 1 - 2 = -1, and -1 + 5 = 4). However, the program will output 3, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should ensure that the player number is always within the valid range by adjusting the modulo operation and handling negative results appropriately.
