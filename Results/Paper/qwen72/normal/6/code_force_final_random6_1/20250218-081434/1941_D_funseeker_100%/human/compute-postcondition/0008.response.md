Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 1 element, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space, `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`, `q` is the first element of `ans`.**

Explanation:
- `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the result of `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
- `q` is the first element of `ans`.
- `r` is an integer.
- `n` is one of the values returned by `func_3()`.
- The other variables (`m`, `x`, `ans`, `c`) remain unchanged.
- `temp` was initially an empty set and now contains the value `(q + r) % n`.
