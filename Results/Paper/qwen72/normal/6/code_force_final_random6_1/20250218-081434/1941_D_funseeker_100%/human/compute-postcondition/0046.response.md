Output State: **`ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '1', `ans` contains all unique values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`. `temp` is a set containing all the values that were added to it during the loop iterations, which are the same as the final values in `ans`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- If `c` is '0' or '?', `ans` will contain all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`.
- If `c` is '1', `ans` will contain all unique values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`.
- The set `temp` will contain all the values that were added to it during the loop, which are the same as the final values in `ans`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The variables `r` and `c` also remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
