Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space, `temp` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 1 element, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, where `q` is the first element of `ans`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 2 elements, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the value `(q - r) % n` where `q` is the second element of `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, where `q` is the second element of `ans`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 2 elements, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, where `q` is the next element of `ans`. Otherwise, `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
