### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The input handling functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) are correctly implemented to read and process the input. They ensure that the input is read line by line and converted to the appropriate data types.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws**:
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then iterates over the current set of possible positions `ans`.
   - For each position `q`:
     - If the direction is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`.
     - If the direction is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`.
   - After processing all possible positions for the current throw, it updates `ans` to `temp`.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where position `0` is equivalent to position `n` by removing `0` and adding `n` to the set. This is necessary because in a circular arrangement, position `0` and position `n` are the same.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of possible positions.
   - It then prints the sorted list of possible positions.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
  - The function reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x` using `func_3()`.
  - It initializes the set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
  - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c` using `func_1()`.
  - It correctly updates the set `ans` by considering both possible directions (clockwise and counterclockwise) if the direction is unknown ('?').
  - The use of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` ensures that the positions wrap around correctly in a circular arrangement.
  - The edge case handling where `0` is converted to `n` is correctly implemented.
  - The final output is the number of possible positions and the sorted list of possible positions, which matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is correctly implemented to solve the problem as described. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
