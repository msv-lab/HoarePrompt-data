Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing newline characters.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases by calling `func_1` and converting the result to an integer.
   - `func_3` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts each part to an integer, returning a list of integers.

2. **Test Case Loop**:
   - The main loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `func_4` is called.

3. **Function `func_4`**:
   - It reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` from the input using `func_3`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
   - It then iterates `m` times, reading the distance `r` and direction `c` for each throw.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` to include the possible positions of the ball after the throw, considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions if `c` is '?'.
   - If `c` is '0', it only considers the clockwise direction.
   - If `c` is '1', it only considers the counterclockwise direction.
   - After all throws, it checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If so, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set to handle the case where the ball is with the last player in the circle.
   - Finally, it prints the number of players who could have the ball and the sorted list of those players.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
   - The set `ans` is updated correctly for each throw, considering the direction and the circular nature of the game.
   - The final adjustment to handle the case where `0` is in the set is also correct.
   - The output format matches the problem description, printing the number of possible players and the sorted list of their numbers.

Given this reasoning, the program appears to meet the requirements of the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
