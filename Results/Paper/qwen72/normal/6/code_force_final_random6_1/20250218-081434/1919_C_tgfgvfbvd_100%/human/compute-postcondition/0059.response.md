Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 1, `c` is 0 or 1, `a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the previous value of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `x`, and `c` remain unchanged.
- The values of `a` and `b` are swapped. If `l[0]` was less than or equal to the previous `a`, then `a` is now the previous `b` (which was `float('inf')`), and `b` is now the previous `a` (which was `l[0]`). If `l[0]` was greater than `a` but less than or equal to the previous `b`, then `a` is now the previous `b` (which was `float('inf')`), and `b` is now the previous `a` (which was `l[0]`). If `l[0]` was greater than both `a` and `b`, then `a` and `b` remain `float('inf')` and are swapped, so they still hold `float('inf')`.
