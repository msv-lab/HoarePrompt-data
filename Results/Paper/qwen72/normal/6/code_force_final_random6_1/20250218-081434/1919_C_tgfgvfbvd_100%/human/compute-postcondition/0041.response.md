Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `n-1`, `a` and `b` are the two smallest distinct elements in `l` if they exist, otherwise `a` is the smallest element and `b` is `float('inf')`, and `c` is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `l` with the integers provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, but `l` is now a list of integers input by the user.
- The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain valid, with `l` being updated to the new list of integers.
