To determine what will be printed by the `print(c)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly used in the `print(c)` statement, so we can ignore it for now.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `x` is set to `n-1`.
   - `a` and `b` are the two smallest distinct elements in `l` if they exist. If they do not exist (i.e., all elements are the same), `a` is the smallest element and `b` is `float('inf')`.
   - `c` is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` and `b` are determined based on the list `l`. If `l` has at least two distinct elements, `a` and `b` will be the two smallest distinct elements. If `l` has only one distinct element, `a` will be that element and `b` will be `float('inf')`.
   - `c` is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`. If `b` is `float('inf')`, then `c` will be the count of elements in `l` that are greater than `a`.

3. **Execution of the `print(c)` Statement:**
   - The `print(c)` statement will output the value of `c`, which is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - If `l` has at least two distinct elements, `c` will be the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both of the two smallest distinct elements.
   - If `l` has only one distinct element, `c` will be the count of elements in `l` that are greater than the smallest element (since `b` is `float('inf')`).

Output: **c (where c is the count of elements in l that are greater than both a and b, and a and b are the two smallest distinct elements in l if they exist, otherwise a is the smallest element and b is float('inf'))**
