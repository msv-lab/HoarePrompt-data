Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 1, and `c` is 0, 1, or 2. If `l[1]` ≤ `a`, then `a` is `l[1]` and `b` retains its value. If `l[1]` > `a` and `l[1]` ≤ `b`, then `b` is `l[1]` and `a` retains its value. If `l[1]` > `b` and `a` > `b`, then `a` is updated to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is updated to the previous value of `a`. If `l[1]` > `b` and `a` ≤ `b`, then `a` is `l[1]` and `b` retains its value. `c` is 0 or 1 if `l[1]` ≤ `a`, and `c` is 1 or 2 if `l[1]` > `a`.***
