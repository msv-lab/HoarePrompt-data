Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 1. If `l[1]` ≤ `b`, then `b` is set to the value of `l[1]`. If `a` > `b`, then `a` is set to the previous value of `b`, `b` is set to the previous value of `a`, and the value of `c` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. If `l[1]` > `b`, then `a` is set to `l[1]`, `b` remains unchanged, and `c` is increased by 1.***
