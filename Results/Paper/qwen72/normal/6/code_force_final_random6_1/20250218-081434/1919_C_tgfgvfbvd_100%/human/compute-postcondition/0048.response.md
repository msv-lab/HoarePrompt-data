Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 0, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, and `c` is 0. The current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`. If `a` > `b`, then the current value of `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and the current value of `b` is now equal to the previous value of `a`. Otherwise, the values of `a` and `b` remain `float('inf')`.**
