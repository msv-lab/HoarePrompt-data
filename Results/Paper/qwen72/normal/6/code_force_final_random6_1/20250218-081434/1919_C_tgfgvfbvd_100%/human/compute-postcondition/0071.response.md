Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 2, `b` is `l[2]`. If `a` > `b`, then `a` is updated to the previous value of `b`, `b` is updated to the previous value of `a`, and `c` is 0, 1, or 2. If `l[1]` ≤ `a`, then `c` is 0 or 1. If `l[1]` > `a`, then `c` is 1 or 2. If `a` ≤ `b`, then `a` and `b` retain their values, and `c` is 0, 1, or 2. If `l[1]` ≤ `a`, then `c` is 0 or 1. If `l[1]` > `a`, then `c` is 1 or 2.**
