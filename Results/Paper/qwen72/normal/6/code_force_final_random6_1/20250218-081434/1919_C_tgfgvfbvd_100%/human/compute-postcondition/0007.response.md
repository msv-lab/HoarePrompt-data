Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `c` is 0, `x` is 0, and `a` is equal to `b`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `a` and `b` are swapped. Initially, `a` was `float('inf')` and `b` was also `float('inf')`. After the swap, both `a` and `b` remain `float('inf')`.
- The precondition that `a` is greater than `b` is no longer valid since both are now equal.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `c`, `x`) remain unchanged.
