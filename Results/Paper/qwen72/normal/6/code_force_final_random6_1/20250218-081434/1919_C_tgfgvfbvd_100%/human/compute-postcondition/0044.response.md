The only objects in the loop head are the variables `x` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `x` is set to `n-1`, but for the loop to execute, `x` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 0, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, and `c` is 0**
