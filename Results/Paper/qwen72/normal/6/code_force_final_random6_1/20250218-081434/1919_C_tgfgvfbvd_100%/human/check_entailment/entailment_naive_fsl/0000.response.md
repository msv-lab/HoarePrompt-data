Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Here is an example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output a value that is not necessarily the minimum penalty. The logic in the program seems to be trying to track the smallest and second smallest elements in the array and count how many elements are greater than both of these, but this approach does not correctly calculate the penalty as defined in the problem.

The correct approach to minimize the penalty would be to split the array such that one subsequence is non-decreasing and the other is non-increasing. The penalty is then the number of elements that cannot be placed in either subsequence without increasing the penalty. The provided program does not follow this logic, leading to incorrect results in many cases.
