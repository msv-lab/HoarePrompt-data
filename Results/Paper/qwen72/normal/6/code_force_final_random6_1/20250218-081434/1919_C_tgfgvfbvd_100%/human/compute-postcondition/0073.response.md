Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 2, `a` is now equal to `l[2]`, `b` retains its previous value, and `c` is 1, 2, or 3. If `l[1]` ≤ `a`, then `c` is 1 or 2. If `l[1]` > `a`, then `c` is 2 or 3.**
