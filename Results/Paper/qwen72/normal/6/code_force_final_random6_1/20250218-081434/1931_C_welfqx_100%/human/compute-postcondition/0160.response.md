Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is 1, `r` is `r+1`, `t` is greater than `r+1`, `f` is 1, `j` is the index where the first inequality is found, `onum` is a reversed copy of the list `num`, `cn` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of the list `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the list `num`, and `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`.**

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the loop or conditional block it is currently inside. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the loop or conditional block is terminated. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions and variable values, with the addition that the loop or conditional block is broken.
