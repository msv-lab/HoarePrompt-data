Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `cn` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `num` that are equal, `n` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 0, and all other variables remain unchanged. If the first two elements of `onum` are equal, `ck` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the first element of `onum` is not equal to the second element, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
