Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `onum` that are equal up to the point where the elements are no longer equal or the end of the list is reached, `r` is `r+1`, `t` is greater than `r+1`, `f` is 1 if all elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0, `j` is `n-2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where the first inequality is found, `onum` is a reversed copy of the list `num`, `cn` is 1, and all other variables (`symb1`, `symb2`) remain unchanged.**
