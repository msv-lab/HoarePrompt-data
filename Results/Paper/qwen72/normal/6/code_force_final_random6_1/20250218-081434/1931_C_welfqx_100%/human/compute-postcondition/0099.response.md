The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is at some value that is less than `n - 1`. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `i` must be less than `n - 1`**
