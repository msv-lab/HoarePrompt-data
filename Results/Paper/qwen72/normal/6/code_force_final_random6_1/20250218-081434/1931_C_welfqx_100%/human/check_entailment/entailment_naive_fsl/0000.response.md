Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array has multiple different elements, and the optimal solution involves selecting a value that appears more than once in the array but is not at the beginning or the end. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`. The optimal solution would be to select `i = 2`, `j = 3`, and `x = 2`, which would cost 2 burles, but the program would output 3 burles because it only considers the longest prefix and suffix of the same value. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
