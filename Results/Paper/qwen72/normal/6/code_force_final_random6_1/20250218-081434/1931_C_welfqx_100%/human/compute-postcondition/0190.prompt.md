Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    f = 1
    num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
    for j in range(n - 1):
        if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
            f = 0
            break
    if n == 1 or f == 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    onum = num.copy()
    onum.reverse()
    cn = 1
    ck = 1
    f = 1
    symb1 = num[0]
    symb2 = onum[0]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
            cn += 1
        else:
            break
    for ii in range(n - 1):
        if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
            ck += 1
        else:
            break
    if symb1 == symb2:
        cn += ck
    print(n - max(cn, ck))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is the index where the first inequality was found if the loop was broken, otherwise `j` is `n-2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first integer in the list `num`, `symb2` is the last integer in the list `num`, `i` is the index where the first inequality was found if the loop was broken, otherwise `i` is `n-2`, `ii` is the index of the last element checked in `onum` before the loop broke or completed, `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the reversed list `onum` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the list `num` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list plus the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the reversed list `onum` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `onum` that are equal up to the point where the elements are no longer equal or the end of the list is reached, and all other variables (`t`, `r`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`) remain unchanged. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `num` that are equal plus `ck`. Otherwise, `cn` remains the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `num` that are equal.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 0, `ii` is `n-2`, `r` is `r+1`, `t` is greater than `r+1`, `f` is 1, `j` is the index where the first inequality is found if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n-2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the list `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the list `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the list `num`. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list that are equal to their next element plus `ck`, and `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list that are equal to their next element plus 1 if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list that are equal to their next element plus 1. If `symb1` is not equal to `symb2`, the variables `cn` and `ck` retain their original values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
