Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `onum` that are equal up to the point where the elements are no longer equal or the end of the list is reached, `r` is `r+1`, `t` must be greater than `r+1`, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers input by the user, and all other variables (`t`, `j`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `cn`) remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1):
    if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
        f = 0
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `onum` that are equal up to the point where the elements are no longer equal or the end of the list is reached, `r` is `r+1`, `t` must be greater than `r+1`, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers input by the user, `j` is 0, and all other variables (`t`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `cn`) remain unchanged. If `num[0]` and `num[1]` are not equal, `f` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `onum` that are equal up to the point where the elements are no longer equal or the end of the list is reached, `r` is `r+1`, `t` must be greater than `r+1`, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers input by the user, `j` is 1, and all other variables (`t`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `cn`) remain unchanged. If `num[1]` and `num[2]` are not equal, `f` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 2, `ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `onum` that are equal up to the point where the elements are no longer equal or the end of the list is reached, `r` is `r+1`, `t` is greater than `r+1`, `f` is 1 if `num[j]` equals `num[j + 1]`, otherwise `f` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `j` is 2, and all other variables (`t`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `cn`) remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
