Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `ii` is `n-2`
   - `r` is `r+1` (This seems to be a typo or a self-assignment, so we can assume `r` is some value and `r+1` is the new value of `r`)
   - `t` is greater than `r+1`
   - `f` is 1
   - `j` is the index where the first inequality is found if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n-2`
   - `onum` is a reversed copy of the list `num`
   - `symb1` is the first element of the list `num`
   - `symb2` is the last element of the list `num`
   - If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list that are equal to their next element plus `ck`
   - `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list that are equal to their next element plus 1 if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list that are equal to their next element plus 1

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(n - max(cn, ck))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `cn` and `ck` are determined based on the conditions involving the list `num` and the elements `symb1` and `symb2`.
   - If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is calculated as the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list that are equal to their next element plus `ck`.
   - `ck` is calculated as the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list that are equal to their next element plus 1 if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise it is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list that are equal to their next element plus 1.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - **Scenario 1: `symb1` is equal to `symb2`**
     - In this case, `cn` is calculated based on the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list that are equal to their next element plus `ck`.
     - `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list that are equal to their next element plus 1 if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.
     - The value of `max(cn, ck)` will be the larger of the two values.
     - The output will be `n - max(cn, ck)`.

   - **Scenario 2: `symb1` is not equal to `symb2`**
     - In this case, `cn` and `ck` retain their original values.
     - The value of `max(cn, ck)` will be the larger of the two original values.
     - The output will be `n - max(cn, ck)`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `cn` and `ck` depend on the list `num` and the conditions described, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `n - max(cn, ck)` without knowing the specific values of `num`, `cn`, and `ck`.
   - However, based on the given conditions, the print statement will output the result of `n - max(cn, ck)`.

Output: **n - max(cn, ck) (where n is a positive integer, and cn and ck are determined based on the conditions involving the list num and the elements symb1 and symb2)**
