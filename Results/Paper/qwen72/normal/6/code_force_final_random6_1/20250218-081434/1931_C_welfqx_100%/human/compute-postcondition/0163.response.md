Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is 1, `r` is `r+1`, `t` is greater than `r+1`, `f` is 1, `j` is the index where the first inequality is found if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n-2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the list `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the list `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the list `num`, `cn` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The code `cn += 1` increments the value of `cn` by 1.
- Initially, `cn` can be either 1 or 2 based on the condition: if `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is 2; otherwise, `cn` is 1.
- After the increment, `cn` becomes 3 if it was initially 2, or 2 if it was initially 1. However, since the initial state specifies that `cn` is 2, the output state will reflect `cn` as 3.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
