You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is the last list of integers provided by the user, `j` is the index where the first inequality was found if the loop was broken, otherwise `j` is `n-2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the last `num`, `symb1` is the first integer in the last `num`, `symb2` is the last integer in the last `num`, `i` is the index where the first inequality was found if the loop was broken, otherwise `i` is `n-2`, `ii` is the index of the last element checked in the last `onum` before the loop broke or completed, `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the last `onum` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the last `num` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list plus the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the last `onum` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `num`. It then determines the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from `num` to make it a palindrome. If the list is already a palindrome or contains only one element, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum length of consecutive equal elements from the start and the end of the list, and prints the difference between the total number of elements `n` and this maximum length. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array has multiple different elements, and the optimal solution involves selecting a value that appears more than once in the array but is not at the beginning or the end. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`. The optimal solution would be to select `i = 2`, `j = 3`, and `x = 2`, which would cost 2 burles, but the program would output 3 burles because it only considers the longest prefix and suffix of the same value. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
