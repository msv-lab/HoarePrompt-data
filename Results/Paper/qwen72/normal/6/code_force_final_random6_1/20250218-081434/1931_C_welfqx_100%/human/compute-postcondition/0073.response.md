To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case are `j` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `r` is 1
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1
- `f` is 1
- `num` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `j` is 0
- `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`
- `symb1` is the first integer in the list `num`
- `symb2` is the last integer in the list `num`
- `i` is 0 if the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, otherwise `i` is `n-2`
- `ii` is `n-1` if the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, otherwise `ii` is the index of the last element checked in `onum` before the loop broke or completed
- `ck` is 1 if the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, otherwise `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the reversed list `onum` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list
- `cn` is 1 if the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num` and `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, otherwise `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the list `num` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list plus the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the reversed list `onum` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list

The loop statement is:
```
for j in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n - 1`.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 1.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains the same because it is an input parameter and does not change within the loop.

4. **New State**:
   - `j` will be 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first integer in the list `num`, `symb2` is the last integer in the list `num`, `i` is 0 if the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, otherwise `i` is `n-2`, `ii` is `n-1` if the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, otherwise `ii` is the index of the last element checked in `onum` before the loop broke or completed, `ck` is 1 if the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, otherwise `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the reversed list `onum` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list, `cn` is 1 if the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num` and `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, otherwise `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the list `num` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list plus the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the reversed list `onum` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list.**
