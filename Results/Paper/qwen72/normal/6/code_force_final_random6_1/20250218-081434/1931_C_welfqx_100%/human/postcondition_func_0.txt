The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `num`. It then determines the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from `num` to make it a palindrome. If the list is already a palindrome or contains only one element, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum length of consecutive equal elements from the start and the end of the list, and prints the difference between the total number of elements `n` and this maximum length. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.
