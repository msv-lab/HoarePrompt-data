Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is `n-2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where the first inequality was found, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first integer in the list `num`, `symb2` is the last integer in the list `num`, `i` is 0. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 2. Otherwise, `cn` remains 1 and `j` is the index where the first inequality was found.***
