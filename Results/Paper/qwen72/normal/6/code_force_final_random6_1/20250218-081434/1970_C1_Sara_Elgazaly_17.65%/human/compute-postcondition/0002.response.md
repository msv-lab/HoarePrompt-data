The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the expression `x - 1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x - 1`. For the loop to execute, `x - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `x` must be greater than 1.

State: **`x` is greater than 1, `_` is 0**
