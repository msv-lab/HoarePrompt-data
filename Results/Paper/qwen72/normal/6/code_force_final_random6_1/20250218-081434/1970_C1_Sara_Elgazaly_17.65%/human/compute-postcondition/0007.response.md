Output State: **`x` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers based on the new input, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` as its last element, `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` as its last element.** 

The values of `x` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to new integers based on the input provided. The lists `lst[a]` and `lst[b]` still include `b` and `a` as their last elements, respectively.
