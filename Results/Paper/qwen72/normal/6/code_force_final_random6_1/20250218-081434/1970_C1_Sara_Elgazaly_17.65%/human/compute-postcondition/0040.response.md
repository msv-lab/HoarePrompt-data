Output State: **The loop will terminate when `lst[x]` becomes empty. At this point, `x` will be the last value of `y` that caused the loop to break, and `lst[x]` will be an empty list. The variables `a`, `b`, and `_` will remain unchanged from their initial values. `s` is now the opposite of its initial value, and `y` is the last element that was popped from `lst[x]` before it became empty. Additionally, `lst[y]` is not an empty list. The `break` statement causes the loop to terminate immediately.**

The `break` statement causes the loop to terminate immediately, so the loop will not continue. The values of `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is the opposite of its initial value, and `y` is the last element that was popped from `lst[x]` before it became empty. `lst[x]` is an empty list, and `lst[y]` is not an empty list. The loop will not execute any further code after the `break` statement.
