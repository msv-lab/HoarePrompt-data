Output State: **The function `func` does not take any parameters, but based on the problem description, it is implied that the input is provided externally and consists of: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, an integer t (t=1) representing the number of rounds, a list of n-1 pairs of integers (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing the edges of the tree, and an integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the first and second integers from the input, respectively. `lst` is now a defaultdict of lists.**
