The code snippet `y = lst[x].pop()` removes the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to the variable `y`. Since `lst[x]` is a non-empty list, this operation will succeed and `y` will hold the value of the last element of `lst[x]`. The list `lst[x]` will have one fewer element after this operation.

Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `x - 1`, `a` and `b` are integers based on the input, `lst[a]` is a list that includes all the `b` values appended during the iterations, `lst[b]` is a list that includes all the `a` values appended during the iterations, `s` is True, `lst[x]` is a list with one fewer element, and `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the operation.**
