To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 0, and it increments by 2 in each iteration. The initial state provided is `i` is `i + 1`, which is not a valid initial state for the loop to start. We need to set `i` to 0.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The loop increments `i` by 2, so `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once. The initial state provided is `n` is the first integer from the input, which does not guarantee that `n` is greater than 0. We need to ensure that `n` is at least 2.

The other variables, `p` and `ind`, are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of `n` zeros, `ind` is equal to `n`**
