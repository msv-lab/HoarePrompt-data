Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2` if `n` is odd or `n - 3` if `n` is even, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `n - 4` and all other elements are 0, `ind` is `n - 4`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains greater than 0.
- The value of `i` remains `n - 2` if `n` is odd, or `n - 3` if `n` is even.
- The list `p` still has `n` elements, but now `p[i]` is updated to `ind`, which is `n - 4`.
- The value of `ind` remains `n - 4`.
