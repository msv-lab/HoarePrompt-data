To determine what will be printed by the `print(*p)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the list `p` step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n` remains unchanged.
2. `i` is the last odd number less than `n`.
3. `p` is a list where:
   - Every odd-indexed element (starting from index 1) is filled with values starting from `1 + n % 2` and increasing by 2.
   - Every even-indexed element is filled with values in descending order starting from `n` and decreasing by 2.
4. `ind` is `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (number of odd-indexed elements in `p`)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `i`**:
   - `i` is the last odd number less than `n`. For example, if `n = 10`, then `i = 9`. If `n = 11`, then `i = 9`.

2. **Construct the list `p`**:
   - **Odd-indexed elements**: Start from `1 + n % 2` and increase by 2.
     - If `n` is even, `1 + n % 2 = 1`.
     - If `n` is odd, `1 + n % 2 = 2`.
   - **Even-indexed elements**: Start from `n` and decrease by 2.

3. **Example Calculation**:
   - Let's consider `n = 10`:
     - `i = 9` (the last odd number less than 10).
     - **Odd-indexed elements**: Start from `1` and increase by 2.
       - `p[1] = 1`
       - `p[3] = 3`
       - `p[5] = 5`
       - `p[7] = 7`
       - `p[9] = 9`
     - **Even-indexed elements**: Start from `10` and decrease by 2.
       - `p[0] = 10`
       - `p[2] = 8`
       - `p[4] = 6`
       - `p[6] = 4`
       - `p[8] = 2`
     - The list `p` will be: `[10, 1, 8, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 2, 9]`.

   - Let's consider `n = 11`:
     - `i = 9` (the last odd number less than 11).
     - **Odd-indexed elements**: Start from `2` and increase by 2.
       - `p[1] = 2`
       - `p[3] = 4`
       - `p[5] = 6`
       - `p[7] = 8`
       - `p[9] = 10`
     - **Even-indexed elements**: Start from `11` and decrease by 2.
       - `p[0] = 11`
       - `p[2] = 9`
       - `p[4] = 7`
       - `p[6] = 5`
       - `p[8] = 3`
     - The list `p` will be: `[11, 2, 9, 4, 7, 6, 5, 8, 3, 10]`.

### General Pattern:
- For an even `n`:
  - `p[0] = n`
  - `p[1] = 1`
  - `p[2] = n - 2`
  - `p[3] = 3`
  - ...
  - `p[n-2] = 2`
  - `p[n-1] = n - 1`

- For an odd `n`:
  - `p[0] = n`
  - `p[1] = 2`
  - `p[2] = n - 2`
  - `p[3] = 4`
  - ...
  - `p[n-2] = 3`
  - `p[n-1] = n - 1`

### Output:
The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces. The elements of `p` are constructed as follows:
- Even-indexed elements: Values in descending order starting from `n` and decreasing by 2.
- Odd-indexed elements: Values starting from `1 + n % 2` and increasing by 2.

Output: **[n, 1 + n % 2, n - 2, 3 + n % 2, n - 4, 5 + n % 2, ..., 2, n - 1] (where the list `p` is constructed as described above)**
