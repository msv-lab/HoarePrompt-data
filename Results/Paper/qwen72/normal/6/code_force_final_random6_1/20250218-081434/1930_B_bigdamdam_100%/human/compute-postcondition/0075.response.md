Output State: **`n` must be at least 6, `i` is 5, `p[1]` is `ind`, `p[3]` is `ind`, `p[5]` is `ind + 2`, `ind` is increased by 2, `ind` is now `ind + 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is incremented by 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `p[1]`, `p[3]`, and `p[5]` are still valid with their respective values, and `ind` is now `ind + 2`.
