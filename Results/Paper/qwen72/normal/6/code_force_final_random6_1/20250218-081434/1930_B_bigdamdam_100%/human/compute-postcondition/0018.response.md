The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over `i` starting from 1, with a step of 2, and continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `p[i]` is now `ind`.
- `ind` is increased by 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 2 (as specified by the step in the loop), and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be 3. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `p[i]` is now `ind`, `ind` is increased by 2, `i` is 3**
