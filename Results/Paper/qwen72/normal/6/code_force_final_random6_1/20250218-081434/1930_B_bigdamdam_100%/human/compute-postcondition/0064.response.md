The value of `ind` is decremented by 2. The initial value of `ind` is `n - 4`. Therefore, after the execution, `ind` becomes `n - 6`. The values of `n`, `i`, and the list `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 6, `i` is 4, `p` is a list where the first element is `n`, the third element is `n - 2`, and the fifth element is `n - 4`, the rest are zeros, `ind` is equal to `n - 6`.**
