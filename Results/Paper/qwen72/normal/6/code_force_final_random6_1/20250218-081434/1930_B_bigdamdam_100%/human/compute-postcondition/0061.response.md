Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 2, `p` is a list where the first element is `n` and the rest are zeros except the third element which is `n - 2`, `ind` is equal to `n - 4`**

The value of `ind` is decreased by 2, so it is now `n - 4`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
