The function `func` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple or list of three digits (a, b, c) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, and the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The exact nature of the results is not specified in the provided information, but it is implied that the function processes each test case and returns a corresponding output for each one.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple or list of three digits (a, b, c) with 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, and the number of test cases is an integer between 1 and 1000. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a processed test case.**
