Output State: **`q` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `q - 1`, and for each iteration, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds. If `a < b > c`, then the conditions `a < b` and `b > c` hold. Otherwise, none of the conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b > c` hold.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `q` is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations that the loop has run.
- The loop counter `i` has reached the value `q - 1`, which is the last index of the range `0` to `q-1`.
- For each iteration of the loop, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` were input integers, and the loop checked the conditions `a < b < c` and `a < b > c` to determine the output. If neither condition was met, the output was `NONE`.
