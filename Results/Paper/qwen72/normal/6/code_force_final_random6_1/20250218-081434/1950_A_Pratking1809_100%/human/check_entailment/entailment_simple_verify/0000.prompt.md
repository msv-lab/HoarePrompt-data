You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple or list of three digits (a, b, c) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, and the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `q` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `q - 1`, and for each iteration, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds. If `a < b > c`, then the conditions `a < b` and `b > c` hold. Otherwise, none of the conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b > c` hold.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles all potential cases based on the problem description. It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads three digits. It then checks if the digits form a stair (a < b < c), a peak (a < b > c), or neither, and prints the appropriate result. The logic and conditions used in the program match the problem requirements exactly, and there are no edge cases or missing logic that would cause the program to fail.
