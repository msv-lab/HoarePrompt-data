The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the user input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates the minimum length of consecutive subarrays where all elements are equal to the first element of `a`. If the list `a` has only one element or if all elements are the same, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of such subarrays. After processing all test cases, the function ends with `t` being 0, and the variables `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans` holding their final values from the last test case.
