Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n-1`: This means `i` is the index of the last element in the list `a` if `n` is the length of the list `a`.
- `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` in the last segment of the list `a`: This means `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
- `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in any segment of the list `a` including the last segment: This means `ans` is the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in any part of the list `a`.
- Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`: This means that either the list `a` has only one element, or the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` is equal to the length of the list `a`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is simply `print(-1)`, which means it will print the integer `-1`.
- The values of `i`, `cnt`, and `ans` do not affect the output of this print statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.
- The condition that either `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n` also does not influence the print statement, as it is a standalone statement that prints a constant value.

### Conclusion:
The code will print the integer `-1` regardless of the values of `i`, `cnt`, `ans`, or `n`.

Output: **-1**
