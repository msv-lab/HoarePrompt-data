Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` during the loop execution, updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.***
