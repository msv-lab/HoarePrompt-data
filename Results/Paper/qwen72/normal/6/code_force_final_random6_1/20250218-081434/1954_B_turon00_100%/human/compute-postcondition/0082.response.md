Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum value between the original `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0.** 

The code initializes `cnt` to 0, which is the only change in the state. All other variables remain as they were in the initial state.
