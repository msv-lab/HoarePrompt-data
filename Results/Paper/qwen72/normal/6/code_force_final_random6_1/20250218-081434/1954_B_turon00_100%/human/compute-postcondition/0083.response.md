Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is updated based on the loop body conditions. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum value between the original `ans` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is reset to 0.***
