You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, the array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        tmp = a[0]
        
        cnt = 0
        
        ans = n
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == tmp:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
                cnt = 0
        
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
        if n == 1 or ans == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` during the loop execution, updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the output is `-1`. Otherwise, the output is `ans`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` (length of the list `a`), and `a` (a list of integers). It processes the list `a` for each test case and returns a result based on the input.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
