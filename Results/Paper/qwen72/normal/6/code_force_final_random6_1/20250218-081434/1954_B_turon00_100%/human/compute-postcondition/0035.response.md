Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first integer in the new list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive appearances of `tmp` found in the new list `a` before the last sequence.**

Explanation:
- `cnt` is reset to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
