Output State: **`t` is equal to `b * 2 // 5 + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first input string, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t2` is equal to `a - t1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.
- `t2` is equal to `a - t1`.
- `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- Substituting `t2` and `t1` into the new value of `t`, we get `t = t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1`.
- Simplifying, `t = t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1`.
- Further simplifying, `t = t + (a + b * 4 - t * 15) // 15 + 1`.
- Therefore, `t` is equal to `b * 2 // 5 + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
