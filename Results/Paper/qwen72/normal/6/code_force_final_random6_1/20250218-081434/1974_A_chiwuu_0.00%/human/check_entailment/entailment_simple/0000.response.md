### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Initial Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The variable `t` is calculated as `b * 2`, which represents the total number of cells required for all 2x2 icons.
   - The program then calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons by dividing `t` by 5 (since each screen has 5 rows) and adding 1 if there is a remainder. This is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the total number of cells in a screen is 15 (5 rows * 3 columns).

3. **Remaining Cells for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The variable `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which represents the total number of cells available after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` (the remaining cells) is greater than or equal to `a` (the number of 1x1 icons), then no additional screens are needed, and `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, the program calculates the additional number of screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons. This is done by calculating `t2` as `a - t1` (the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed) and then determining how many more screens are needed by dividing `t2` by 15 and adding 1 if there is a remainder.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case, which is the final value of `t`.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Initial Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
  - The calculation `t = b * 2` is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and thus `b * 4` cells are needed.
  - The division `t // 5` and the addition of 1 if there is a remainder is also correct because each screen has 5 rows, and we need to ensure that all 2x2 icons fit within the screens.

- **Remaining Cells for 1x1 Icons**:
  - The calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is correct because it determines the total number of cells available after placing all 2x2 icons.
  - The check `if t1 >= a` is correct because it ensures that if there are enough remaining cells, no additional screens are needed.
  - The calculation for additional screens `t2 // 15 + 1` is correct because it ensures that all remaining 1x1 icons are placed, even if they don't completely fill a screen.

### Edge Cases:

- **Zero Icons**: The program correctly handles cases where both `a` and `b` are zero, outputting 0 screens.
- **Only 1x1 Icons**: The program correctly handles cases where only 1x1 icons are present, calculating the number of screens needed based on the total number of 1x1 icons.
- **Only 2x2 Icons**: The program correctly handles cases where only 2x2 icons are present, calculating the number of screens needed based on the total number of 2x2 icons.
- **Mixed Icons**: The program correctly handles cases where both 1x1 and 2x2 icons are present, ensuring that the minimum number of screens is used.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens needed to place all the icons, considering both 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The logic is sound and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
