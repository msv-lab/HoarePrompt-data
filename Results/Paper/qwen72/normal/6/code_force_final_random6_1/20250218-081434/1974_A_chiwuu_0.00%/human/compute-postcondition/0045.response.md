Output State: **`t` is equal to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first input string, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `b * 26`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t // 5 + 1`. Since `t` was initially `b * 2`, the new value of `t` becomes `b * 2 // 5 + 1`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `t1`) remain unchanged.
- `t1` was initially `t * 15 - b * 4`, which simplifies to `b * 30 - b * 4` or `b * 26`. This value remains the same after the code execution.
