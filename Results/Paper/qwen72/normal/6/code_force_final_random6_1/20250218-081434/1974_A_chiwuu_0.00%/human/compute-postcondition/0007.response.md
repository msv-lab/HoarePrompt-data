Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first input string, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t` is now equal to `2 * b // 5`.**

Explanation:
- `t` was initially set to `2 * b`, and it is divisible by 5.
- The code `t = t // 5` divides `t` by 5 and assigns the result back to `t`.
- Since `t` was divisible by 5, the new value of `t` is `2 * b // 5`.
- The new value of `t` is now an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2000, because `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, and `2 * b` is between 0 and 198, so `2 * b // 5` is between 0 and 39.6, which when integer divided by 5, results in an integer between 0 and 39.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
