The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is set to `a - t1`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1`.**
