### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 icons and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating the Number of Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons as `t = b * 2`. This is incorrect because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, not 2.
   - The correct calculation should be `t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15`. This formula ensures that the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is correctly calculated, accounting for any remainder.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the total number of cells available on the screens already used for 2x2 icons as `t * 15`.
   - It then subtracts the number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons: `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If the remaining space is sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`t1 >= a`), it does not need to add more screens.
   - If the remaining space is not sufficient, it calculates the additional number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons using `t2 = a - t1` and `t2 % 15`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Step 1**: Reading input and splitting it into `a` and `b` is correct.
- **Step 2**: The calculation `t = b * 2` is incorrect. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so the total number of cells occupied by `b` 2x2 icons should be `b * 4`. The number of screens required for `b` 2x2 icons should be `(b * 4 + 14) // 15` to account for the total cells and the remainder.
- **Step 3**: The calculation of remaining space `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is correct if `t` is correctly calculated.
- **Step 4**: The additional screens needed for 1x1 icons should be calculated correctly using `t2 = a - t1` and `(t2 + 14) // 15`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15  # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4  # Calculate the remaining space for 1x1 icons
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            t = t + (t2 + 14) // 15  # Calculate the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        print(t)
```

### Explanation of the Correction:

- **Step 2**: The formula `(b * 4 + 14) // 15` is used to calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons. This formula ensures that if there is a remainder, an additional screen is added.
- **Step 4**: The formula `(t2 + 14) // 15` is used to calculate the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons. This formula ensures that if there is a remainder, an additional screen is added.

### Conclusion:

The original program has a logical error in the calculation of the number of screens required for 2x2 icons. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
