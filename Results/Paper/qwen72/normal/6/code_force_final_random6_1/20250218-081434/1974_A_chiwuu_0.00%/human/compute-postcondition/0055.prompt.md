Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    t = b * 2
    if t % 5 == 0:
        t = t // 5
    else:
        t = t // 5 + 1
    t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
    if t1 >= a:
        t = t
    else:
        t2 = a - t1
        if t2 % 15 == 0:
            t = t + t2 // 15
        else:
            t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
    print(t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first input string, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is updated to `2 * b // 5` if `t` was divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is updated to `2 * b // 5 + 1`. If `t1` is less than `a`, then `t2` is equal to `a - t1`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, then `t` is updated to `2 * b // 5 + t2 // 15` if `t` was divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is updated to `2 * b // 5 + 1 + t2 // 15`. If `t2` is not divisible by 15, then `t` is updated to `2 * b // 5 + t2 // 15 + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is set to `a - t1`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is equal to `b * 2 // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is equal to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. `n` is greater than 2. `i` is 2. `a` is the integer value of the first input string. `b` is the integer value of the second input string. `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is updated based on the condition `t2 % 15 == 0`: if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`; otherwise, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
