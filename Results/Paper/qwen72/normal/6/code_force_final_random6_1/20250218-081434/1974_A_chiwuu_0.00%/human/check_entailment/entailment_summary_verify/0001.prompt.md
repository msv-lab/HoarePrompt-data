You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. It then calculates a value `t` based on `b` and updates `t` based on the relationship between `a` and a derived value `t1`. Finally, it prints the updated value of `t` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` test cases have been processed, and `t` has been printed for each case. The final state of the program includes the processed values of `t` for each test case, but the variables `a`, `b`, `t`, `t1`, and `i` are not retained for use outside the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 icons and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating the Number of Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a screen has 15 cells.
   - The formula `t = b * 2` is used to calculate the total number of 2x2 icons in terms of the number of cells they occupy.
   - The program then determines the number of screens needed for these icons using `t // 5` and `t % 5`. This is because each screen can fit 2 rows of 2x2 icons, which is 10 cells (5 cells per row).

3. **Calculating Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the total number of cells available on the screens already used for 2x2 icons: `t * 15`.
   - It then subtracts the number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons: `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If the remaining space is sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`t1 >= a`), it does not need to add more screens.
   - If the remaining space is not sufficient, it calculates the additional number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons using `t2 = a - t1` and `t2 % 15`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Step 1**: Reading input and splitting it into `a` and `b` is correct.
- **Step 2**: The calculation `t = b * 2` is incorrect. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so the total number of cells occupied by `b` 2x2 icons should be `b * 4`. The number of screens required for `b` 2x2 icons should be `b * 4 // 15` and `b * 4 % 15` to account for the total cells and the remainder.
- **Step 3**: The calculation of remaining space `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is correct if `t` is correctly calculated.
- **Step 4**: The additional screens needed for 1x1 icons should be calculated correctly using `t2 = a - t1` and `t2 % 15`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15  # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4  # Calculate the remaining space for 1x1 icons
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            t = t + (t2 + 14) // 15  # Calculate the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        print(t)
```

### Explanation of the Correction:

- **Step 2**: The formula `(b * 4 + 14) // 15` is used to calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons. This formula ensures that if there is a remainder, an additional screen is added.
- **Step 4**: The formula `(t2 + 14) // 15` is used to calculate the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons. This formula ensures that if there is a remainder, an additional screen is added.

### Conclusion:

The original program has a logical error in the calculation of the number of screens required for 2x2 icons. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
