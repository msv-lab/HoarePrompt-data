Output State: **`t` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`.**

The value of `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, where `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
