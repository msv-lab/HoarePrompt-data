Output State: **`t` is equal to `b * 2 // 5`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first input string, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `b * 26`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5`. The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `t1` remain unchanged. The expression `t1` is still equal to `b * 26` because it was initially set to `b * 30 - b * 4`, which simplifies to `b * 26`.
