Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`.** 

The variable `a` is now an integer, as it was converted from its initial integer value using the `int()` function. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
