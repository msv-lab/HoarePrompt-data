To determine what will be printed by the `print(t)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `x` and `y` are integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is the integer value of the first input string.
   - `b` is the integer value of the second input string.
   - `t1` is calculated as \(t1 = t \times 15 - b \times 4\).

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then:
     - If `t` is divisible by 5, update `t` to \(2 \times b // 5\).
     - Otherwise, update `t` to \(2 \times b // 5 + 1\).
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, then:
     - `t2` is calculated as \(t2 = a - t1\).
     - If `t2` is divisible by 15, update `t` to \(2 \times b // 5 + t2 // 15\).
     - If `t2` is not divisible by 15, update `t` to \(2 \times b // 5 + t2 // 15 + 1\).

3. **Determine the Final Value of `t`:**
   - First, calculate `t1` using the formula \(t1 = t \times 15 - b \times 4\).
   - Check if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`:
     - If true, check if `t` is divisible by 5:
       - If true, update `t` to \(2 \times b // 5\).
       - If false, update `t` to \(2 \times b // 5 + 1\).
     - If false, calculate `t2` using the formula \(t2 = a - t1\).
       - Check if `t2` is divisible by 15:
         - If true, update `t` to \(2 \times b // 5 + t2 // 15\).
         - If false, update `t` to \(2 \times b // 5 + t2 // 15 + 1\).

4. **Output:**
   - The final value of `t` will be printed.

Since the exact values of `t`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `t`. However, based on the given conditions, the final value of `t` will be determined by the steps outlined above.

Output: **t (where t is the final value of t after the conditions are applied as described)**
