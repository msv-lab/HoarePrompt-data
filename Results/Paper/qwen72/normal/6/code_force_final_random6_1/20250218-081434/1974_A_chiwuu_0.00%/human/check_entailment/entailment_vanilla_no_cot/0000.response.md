Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program provided has a logical flaw in how it calculates the number of screens needed. The issue lies in the way it handles the placement of 2x2 icons and the remaining 1x1 icons.

1. **Handling 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons by using `t = b * 2`. This is incorrect because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the grid is 5x3 (15 cells per screen). Therefore, the number of screens required for 2x2 icons should be calculated based on the total number of cells they occupy, not just the number of icons.
   - The correct way to calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is to determine how many 2x2 icons can fit in a single screen and then calculate the total number of screens required. Each screen can fit at most 3 (15 // 4) 2x2 icons. So, the number of screens required for 2x2 icons should be `b // 3 + (1 if b % 3 != 0 else 0)`.

2. **Handling Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the program calculates the remaining cells on the screens used for 2x2 icons and then checks if the remaining 1x1 icons can fit in those cells. This part is also flawed.
   - The program uses `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` to calculate the remaining cells, which is correct. However, it then checks if `t1 >= a` to see if the remaining 1x1 icons can fit. If they can't, it calculates the additional screens needed using `t2 = a - t1` and `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1`. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that 1x1 icons can be placed in any remaining cells, not just in full screens.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - First, calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
   - Then, calculate the remaining cells on those screens.
   - Finally, calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (b + 2) // 3
        
        # Calculate the remaining cells on the screens used for 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - b * 4
        
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        if remaining_cells >= a:
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2
        else:
            remaining_1x1 = a - remaining_cells
            additional_screens = (remaining_1x1 + 14) // 15  # Ceiling division
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens
        
        print(total_screens)
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of screens is calculated correctly for both 2x2 and 1x1 icons.
