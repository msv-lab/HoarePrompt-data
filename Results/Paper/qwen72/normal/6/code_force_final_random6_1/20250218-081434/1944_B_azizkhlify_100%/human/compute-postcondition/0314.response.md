Output State: **`res` is a list with all elements that satisfy `l[a[j] - 1] == 1` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, `ur` is `ur + 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `ur` is incremented by 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The specific values of `res`, `i`, `n`, `ul`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` are still valid, and the condition that `ul` is not equal to `ur` is still true.
