Based on the initial state provided, we know that `res` is a list with at least three elements, and `i` is the third element in `res`.

Let's break down the `print` statement:

1. `print(i, end=' ')`:
   - `i` is the third element in the list `res`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

Therefore, the `print` statement will print the third element of the list `res` followed by a space.

Output: **[third element of res] **

For example, if `res` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output will be:
Output: **3 **

If `res` is `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']`, the output will be:
Output: **c **

In general, the output will be the third element of the list `res` followed by a space.
