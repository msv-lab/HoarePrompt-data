Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains greater than 1.
- The value of `i` remains `n + 1`.
- The element in the list `r` at the index `a[i] - 1` is set to 0. The specific index depends on the value of `a[i]`, but it is updated to 0 in the list `r`.
