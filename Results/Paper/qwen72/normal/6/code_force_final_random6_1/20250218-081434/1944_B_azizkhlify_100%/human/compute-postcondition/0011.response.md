The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l[a[1] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**
