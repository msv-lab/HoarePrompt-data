To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
2. `i` is 0.
3. `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` is 0 if `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2 for any `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, and each other element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`.
4. `r` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` is incremented by 1.
5. `res` is an empty list.
6. `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` that had a count of 2 in `l` before the loop started.
7. `ur` is 0.
8. `re` is 0.
9. `k` is `2 * k - ul` and the current value of `k` is non-zero.
10. The current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is 0.
- The variable `a[i]` refers to the first element of the list `a`.
- The current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, which means the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) has a count of 1 in the list `a`.

### Output:
The code prints the first element of the list `a` followed by a space.

Output: **a[0] (where a[0] is the first element of the list a)**
