Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `l[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `r[a[k] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `k` from `n` to `2n-1`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 0.
- The operation `l[a[i] - 1] = 0` sets the element in the list `l` at the index `a[i] - 1` to 0. Initially, `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 2, but now it is 0.
- The operations involving `l[a[j] - 1]` and `r[a[k] - 1]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.
