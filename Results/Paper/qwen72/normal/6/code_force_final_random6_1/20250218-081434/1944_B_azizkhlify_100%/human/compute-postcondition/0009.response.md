The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l[a[0] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**
