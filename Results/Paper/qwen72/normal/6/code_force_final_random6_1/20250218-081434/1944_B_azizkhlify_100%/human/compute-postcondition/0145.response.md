To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1.
2. `i` is 2.
3. `l` is a list of length `n` where:
   - The element at index `a[1] - 1` is 0 if `l[a[1] - 1]` was 2.
   - Each other element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`.
4. `r` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` is incremented by 1.
5. `res` is an empty list.
6. `ul` is 4 if `l[a[0] - 1]` was 2 and `l[a[1] - 1]` was 2, otherwise `ul` is 2 if `l[a[0] - 1]` was 2.
7. `ur` is 0.
8. `re` is 0.
9. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2.
2. **List `a`**: The list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we can infer that it must be a list of integers of length at least 3 (since `i` is 2 and we are accessing `a[i]`).

### What is `a[i]`?
- Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` is the element at index 2 of the list `a`.
- The value of `a[2]` is not explicitly given in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact numerical value.

### Output:
The `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the value of `a[2]` twice, followed by a space. Since the exact value of `a[2]` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of its position in the list `a`.

Output: **a[2] a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list a)**
