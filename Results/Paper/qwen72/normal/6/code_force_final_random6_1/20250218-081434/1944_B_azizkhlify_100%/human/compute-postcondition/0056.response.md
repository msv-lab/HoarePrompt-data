The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop condition must still be true. This means `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be 1. For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than `i`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1.**
