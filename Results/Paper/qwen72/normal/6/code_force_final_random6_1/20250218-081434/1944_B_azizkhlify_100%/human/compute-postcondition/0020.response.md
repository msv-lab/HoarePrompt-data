Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `r[a[n] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is incremented by 1, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value `2 * n - 1`, which is the last index in the range from `n` to `2 * n - 1`. Each element in the list `a` from index `n` to `2 * n - 1` has been used to increment the corresponding element in the list `r` by 1. Specifically, `r[a[n] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is incremented by 1, and so on, up to `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` being incremented by 1. The initial condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
