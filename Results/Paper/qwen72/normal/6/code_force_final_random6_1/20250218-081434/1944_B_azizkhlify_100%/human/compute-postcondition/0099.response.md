Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the last element in `res` + 2, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, `res` is a non-empty list that has been fully iterated, `ul` is not equal to `ur` unless the condition `ul == ur` is met, `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0. If `ul == ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ur` is incremented by 2.**
