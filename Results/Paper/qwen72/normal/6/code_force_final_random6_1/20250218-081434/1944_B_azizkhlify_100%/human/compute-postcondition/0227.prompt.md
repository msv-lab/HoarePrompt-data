Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has finished executing, and all elements in `res` have been printed, one after another, separated by spaces. The values of `l`, `r`, `ul`, and `ur` remain unchanged from their initial states, except if `ul` is not equal to `ur`, in which case all elements in `res` that meet the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` have been printed, each element printed twice, separated by spaces, and `ur` may have been increased by 2 for each element in `a` that met this condition within the range `n` to `2 * n - 1`. The loop breaks if `ul` equals `ur` at any point during execution. The input must be a value greater than the number of iterations already completed for the loop to execute one more time. `n` and `k` are reassigned to the new input values. `a` is a list of integers. `l` is now a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. `r` is now a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, and `ur` is 0. `res` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    l[a[i] - 1] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l[a[0] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `l[a[0] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `l[a[1] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `l[a[0] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `l[a[1] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `l[a[2] - 1]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
