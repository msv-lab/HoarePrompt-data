Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `res` is a list with all elements that satisfy `l[a[j] - 1] == 1` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
2. `i` is `n`.
3. `n` is greater than 0.
4. `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
5. The current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is equal to `n`.
2. **Variable `n`**: `n` is greater than 0, so `i` is also greater than 0.
3. **List `a`**: The list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we know that `a[i]` is being accessed. Since `i` is `n` and `n` is greater than 0, `a` must have at least `n + 1` elements to avoid an index out of range error.
4. **Value of `a[i]`**: The initial state mentions that the current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2. This implies that `a[i]` is an index into the list `r` and the value at that index in `r` is 2. However, the exact value of `a[i]` is not provided.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not provided, we can only describe it as the value at index `i` of the list `a`, where `i` is equal to `n`.

Output: **[a[i]] [a[i]] (where a[i] is the value at index i of the list a, and i is equal to n)**
