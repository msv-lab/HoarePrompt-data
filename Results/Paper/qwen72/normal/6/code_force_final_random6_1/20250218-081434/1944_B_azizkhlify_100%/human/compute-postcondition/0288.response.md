Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `res` is a list with at least one element.
   - `i` is the first element in `res`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(i, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `i`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

4. **Determine the Output**:
   - Since `i` is the first element in the list `res`, the `print` statement will output the value of the first element in `res`.
   - The output will be followed by a space.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The exact value of `i` is not provided, but it is the first element of the list `res`.

Output: **[i] (where i is the first element of the list res) followed by a space**
