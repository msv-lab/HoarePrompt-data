Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `l[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `r[a[k] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `k` from `n` to `2n-1`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ul` is increased by 2 and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged. The current value of `ul` is equal to `k * 2`.**
