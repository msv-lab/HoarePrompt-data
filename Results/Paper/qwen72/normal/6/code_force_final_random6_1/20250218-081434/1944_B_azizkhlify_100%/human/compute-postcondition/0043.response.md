Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2` and the element at index `a[2] - 1` in list `l` is 2, then the element at index `a[2] - 1` in list `l` is set to 0 and `ul` is increased by 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ul` is not equal to `k * 2`, the state of the variables and list `l` remains unchanged.***
