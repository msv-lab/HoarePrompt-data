Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the last element in `res` + 2, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, `res` is a non-empty list that has been fully iterated, `ul` is not equal to `ur` unless the condition `ul == ur` is met, `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, `ur` is incremented by 2.**

Explanation: The value of `ur` is incremented by 2, but the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `res`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged. The condition `ul == ur` is still checked, but the only change is the increment of `ur`.
