Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `n` and `k` are the values from the input split, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is a list of integers from the input split, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0.** 

The variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are all initialized to 0, while the other variables (`n`, `k`, `_`, `a`, `l`, and `r`) retain their initial values and states.
