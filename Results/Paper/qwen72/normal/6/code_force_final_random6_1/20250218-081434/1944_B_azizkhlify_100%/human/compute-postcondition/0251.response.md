The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `l[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, and `r[a[k] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `k` from `n` to `2n-1`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `l[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, `ul` is increased by 2, and if `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the `break` statement has been executed, so we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.**
