Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is printing the value of `a[i]` twice.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Determine the Value of `a[i]`:**
   - From the initial state, we know that `i` is 0.
   - The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2. This implies that `a[i] - 1` is an index in the list `l` and the element at that index is 2.
   - Let's denote `a[i]` as `x`. Therefore, `l[x - 1]` is 2.
   - This means that `x - 1` must be an index in `l` and the element at that index is 2.
   - Since `x - 1` is an index, `x` must be an integer greater than 0 (because indices in Python are 0-based).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The value of `a[i]` is `x`, and since `l[x - 1]` is 2, `x` must be such that `l[x - 1]` is 2.
   - The exact value of `x` is not provided, but we know it is an integer that satisfies the condition `l[x - 1] = 2`.

Given the information, the `print` statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **[a[i]] [a[i]] (where a[i] is the integer value such that l[a[i] - 1] is 2)**
