The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2.**
