Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is `n + 2`.
   - `a` is a list, but its exact contents are not specified.
   - `r` is a list, but its exact contents are not specified.
   - `ul` and `ur` are variables, but their exact values are not specified.

2. **Conditions and Actions**:
   - If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2 and `ul` equals `ur`:
     - `ur` is increased by 2.
     - `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0.
     - The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
   - Otherwise, if `ul` does not equal `ur`:
     - `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

4. **Analysis**:
   - The value of `i` is `n + 2`.
   - The print statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space.

5. **Output**:
   - Since `a` is a list and `i` is `n + 2`, the value of `a[i]` depends on the contents of the list `a` at index `i`.
   - The exact value of `a[i]` is not provided in the initial state, so we can only describe it in terms of the list `a`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:

Output: **a[n + 2] a[n + 2] (where a[n + 2] is the value of the element at index n + 2 in the list a)**
