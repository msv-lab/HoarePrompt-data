The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The state before the loop starts should ensure that the input provided is a positive integer.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder**
