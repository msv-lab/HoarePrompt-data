Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The element at the index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is printing the value of `a[i]`.
   - Since `i` is 0, the statement is printing the value of `a[0]`.
   - The initial state does not provide the explicit value of `a[0]`, but it does give us a condition involving `a[0]` and the list `l`.

4. **Condition:**
   - The element at the index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 1.
   - This implies that `a[0] - 1` is a valid index in the list `l`, and the value at that index is 1.
   - Since `a[0] - 1` is a valid index, `a[0]` must be a positive integer (because `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0, so `a[0]` must be at least 1).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The value of `a[0]` is not explicitly given, but we know that `a[0]` is a positive integer.
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `a[0]` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **a[0] (where a[0] is a positive integer)**
