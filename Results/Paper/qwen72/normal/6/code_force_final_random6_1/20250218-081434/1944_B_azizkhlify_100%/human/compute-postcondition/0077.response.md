The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `res`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `res` must have at least one more element, and `i` must be set to the next element in `res`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0
- `i` is the next element in `res`
- `k` is `2 * k - ul`
- `res` must be a non-empty list with at least one more element

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `res` must still be a non-empty list with at least one more element
- `i` must be set to the next element in `res`

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the next element in `res`, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, `res` must be a non-empty list with at least one more element**
