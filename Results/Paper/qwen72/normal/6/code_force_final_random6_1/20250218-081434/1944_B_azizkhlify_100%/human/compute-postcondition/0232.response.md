The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `n` to `2 * n` (not inclusive), so `i` must be less than `2 * n` for the loop to execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1` and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n + 2`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `2 * n`, which means `n + 2` must be less than `2 * n`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `l[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `r[a[n] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is incremented by 1**
