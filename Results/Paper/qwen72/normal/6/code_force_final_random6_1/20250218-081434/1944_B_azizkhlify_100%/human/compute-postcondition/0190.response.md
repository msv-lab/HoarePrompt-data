Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is equal to `n`.
2. **Variable `a[i]`**: The code snippet uses `a[i]` twice in the `print` statement. Since `i` is equal to `n`, we need to determine the value of `a[n]`.
3. **Value of `r[a[i] - 1]`**: The initial state tells us that `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2. This implies that `a[i] - 1` is an index in the list `r` and the value at that index is 2.

Given that `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, we can infer that `a[i] - 1` must be an index in the list `r` that corresponds to the value 2. Therefore, `a[i]` must be 1 more than this index.

### Conclusion:
- Since `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `a[i] - 1` must be an index in `r` where the value is 2.
- Let's denote this index as `k`. Therefore, `a[i] - 1 = k` and `a[i] = k + 1`.

However, without the exact values of `r` and `a`, we can only describe the value of `a[i]` in terms of the index `k` in `r`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the value of a[i] and r[a[i] - 1] is 2)**

This means the output will be the value of `a[i]` repeated twice, followed by a space. The exact numerical value of `a[i]` is not provided, but it is known that `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.
