Output State: **The function should take a single integer `n` as input, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `n` is the length of the permutation `p`. `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of `a` are now reversed, while the elements at odd indices remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at even indices of the list `a`.
- The elements at odd indices of `a` remain the same.
- The length of the list `a` is still `n`, and it contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- The input constraints for `n` are still valid.
