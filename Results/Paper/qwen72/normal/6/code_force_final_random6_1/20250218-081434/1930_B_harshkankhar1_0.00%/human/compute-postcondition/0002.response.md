Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- The function takes a single integer `n` as input, where \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- The elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of `a` are reversed, while the elements at odd indices remain unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a` Construction**:
   - `a` is initially a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. For example, if `n = 5`, then `a` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

2. **Reversing Elements at Even Indices**:
   - The elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are reversed. For `n = 5`, the even indices are 0, 2, and 4.
   - The elements at these indices are `[1, 3, 5]`.
   - Reversing these elements gives `[5, 3, 1]`.

3. **Final State of List `a`**:
   - The elements at even indices are replaced with the reversed elements, while the elements at odd indices remain unchanged.
   - For `n = 5`, the final list `a` would be `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

### General Case:
- For any given `n`, the list `a` will be constructed as `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
- The elements at even indices will be reversed, while the elements at odd indices will remain in their original positions.

### Code Execution:
- The `print(a)` statement will print the modified list `a`.

### Example Output:
- If `n = 5`, the output will be `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.
- If `n = 6`, the output will be `[6, 2, 4, 4, 2, 6]` (Note: the last element is at an even index, so it is reversed).

### Final Answer:
The `print(a)` statement will print the list `a` where the elements at even indices are reversed, and the elements at odd indices remain unchanged.
Output: **[n, 2, n-2, 4, n-4, 6, ..., 1] (where n is the length of the permutation p and the list a is constructed as described)**

This output format ensures that the elements at even indices are reversed, and the elements at odd indices remain in their original positions.
