Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. Additionally, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from the input, and it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `a < b and b > c`, then the condition `a < b and b > c` holds. Otherwise, the condition `a < b and b > c` does not hold, and it is not the case that `a < b < c`.***
