To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
2. `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input.
3. `n` is greater than 1.
4. `i` is 1.
5. The conditions are:
   - If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`.
   - Otherwise, if `a < b and b > c`, then the condition `a < b and b > c` holds.
   - If neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b and b > c` holds, then neither of these conditions is true.

The `print` statement is:
```
print('PEAK')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
