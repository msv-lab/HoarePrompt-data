The given print statement is:
```
print('PEAK')
```

Based on the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the input.
- It is not the case that `a < b < c`.
- Additionally, `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`.

Given these conditions, we can deduce that the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` form a peak pattern, where `a < b` and `b > c`.

The print statement simply prints the string 'PEAK'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not directly used in the print statement, but the fact that they form a peak pattern is relevant to the context of the program.

Output: **PEAK**
