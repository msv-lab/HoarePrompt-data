Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from the input.**

Explanation: The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are now assigned based on the input provided, which is split and converted to integers. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
