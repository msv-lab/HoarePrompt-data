Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from the input, and it is not the case that `a < b < c`. Additionally, `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`.**
