The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input provided. The input is split into three parts, and each part is converted to an integer and assigned to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`, and if `a < b and b > c`, then the condition `a < b and b > c` holds. If neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b and b > c` holds, then neither of these conditions is true.**
