You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input, `n` is the input integer, and `i` is `n-1`. For each iteration from 0 to `n-1`, if `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`. If `a < b and b > c`, then the condition `a < b and b > c` holds. If neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b and b > c` holds, then neither of these conditions is true.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It then evaluates the relationship between these three integers and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b` and `b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. This is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `n` times, which is appropriate for processing each test case.

3. **Reading Test Case Input**: Inside the loop, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from a single line of input using `input().split()` and `map(int, ...)`. This is correct because the problem specifies that each test case contains three digits on a single line.

4. **Condition for Stair**: The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correct as per the problem description.

5. **Condition for Peak**: The program checks if `a < b` and `b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correct as per the problem description.

6. **Output for Other Cases**: If neither the stair nor the peak condition is met, the program outputs "NONE". This is correct as per the problem description.

7. **Output Format**: The program prints the result for each test case on a new line, which matches the required output format.

Given that the program correctly handles the input, processes the conditions, and outputs the results as specified in the problem description, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
