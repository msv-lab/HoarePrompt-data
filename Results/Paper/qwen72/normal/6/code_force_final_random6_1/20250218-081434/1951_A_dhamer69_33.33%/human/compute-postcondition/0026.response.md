Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `start` and `end` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{start} \leq \text{end}\).
2. `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0.
3. `n` is an input integer.
4. `s` is an input string.
5. If `n` is 2, the program executes the if part, and the state of `s` and the other variables remains unchanged.
6. If `n` is not 2, `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in `s`.
7. If `count_1` is odd, the current value of `count_1` is odd.
8. If `count_1` is even, the current value of `count_1` is even.
9. Additionally, if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', this condition is retained. Otherwise, the number of occurrences of the substring '11' in `s` is not equal to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet is a simple `print` statement that prints the string 'YES'.
- The initial state provides conditions and variables, but none of these conditions affect the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `count_1`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
