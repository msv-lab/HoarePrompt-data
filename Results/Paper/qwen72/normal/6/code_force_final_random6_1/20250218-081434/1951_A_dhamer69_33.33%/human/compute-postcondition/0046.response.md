Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `start` and `end` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{start} \leq \text{end}\).
   - `t` is defined as `t - 2` and must be greater than 2. This implies that the original `t` must be greater than 4.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in `s`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `n` is 2, the state of `s` and the other variables remains unchanged.
   - If `n` is not 2, `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in `s`.
   - If `count_1` is odd, the current value of `count_1` remains odd.
   - If `count_1` is even, the current value of `count_1` remains even.
   - If `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', this condition is retained.
   - Otherwise, the number of occurrences of the substring '11' in `s` is not equal to 1.

Given the `print('YES')` statement, the output is simply the string 'YES'. The conditions provided do not affect the output of the `print` statement directly, as the statement is not dependent on any of the variables or conditions mentioned.

Output: **YES**
