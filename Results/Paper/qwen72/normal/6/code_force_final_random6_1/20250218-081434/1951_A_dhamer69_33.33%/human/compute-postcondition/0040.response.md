Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `start` and `end` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{start} \leq \text{end}\).
   - `t` is defined as `t - 2` and `t` must be greater than 2.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is an input string.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `n` is 2, the state of `s` and the other variables remains unchanged.
   - If `n` is not 2, `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in `s`.
   - If `count_1` is odd, the current value of `count_1` remains odd.
   - If `count_1` is even, the current value of `count_1` remains even.
   - Additionally, if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', this condition is retained.
   - Otherwise, the number of occurrences of the substring '11' in `s` is not equal to 1.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains the statement `print('YES')`.

Given the initial state and conditions, the `print` statement will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s`. The conditions provided do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the `print` statement is simply printing a constant string 'YES'.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
