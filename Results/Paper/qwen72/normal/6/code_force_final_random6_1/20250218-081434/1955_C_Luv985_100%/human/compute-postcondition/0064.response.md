Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the converted input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and is now `T - 1`, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`, and if `a[r]` == 0, then `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3` and `ans` is updated to `ans + 1`. If `a[l]` == 0, then `l` is updated to 1 and `ans` is updated to 1, 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `ans` remains 0, 1, 2, or 3. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to `k % 2`, and if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is updated to 1, 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, 1, 2, or 3.***
