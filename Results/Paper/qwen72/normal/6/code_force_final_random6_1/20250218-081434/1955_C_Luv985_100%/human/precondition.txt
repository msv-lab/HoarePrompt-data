t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases; n and k are positive integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) representing the number of ships and the number of attacks by the Kraken, respectively; a is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the durability of each ship. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
