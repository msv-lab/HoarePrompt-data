Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the converted input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l, r <= n - 1, `ans` is an integer such that 0 <= ans <= n, and the loop has terminated. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`. Otherwise, `l` and `r` are not equal, and `ans` remains unchanged. `n` is now an integer.**
