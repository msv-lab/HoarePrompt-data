Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is now `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi` and `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum value between the updated `a[0]` and the updated `a[n - 1]`, and the first element of `a` (`a[l]`) is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so `l` is now 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
