Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0 or 1, and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - mi`, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is updated to `n - 2`, `ans` is 1, and the current value of `a[r + 1]` is 0. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is updated to 1, `ans` is 1, and the first element of `a` (`a[l]`) is 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to the remainder of `k` divided by 2, and `k` remains an integer greater than 0. If `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
