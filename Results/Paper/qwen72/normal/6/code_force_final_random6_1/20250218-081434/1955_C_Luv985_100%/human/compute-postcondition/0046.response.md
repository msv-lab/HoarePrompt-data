Postcondition: ***`t` is the result of `k % 2`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the converted input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and is now `T - 1`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 or 1.***
