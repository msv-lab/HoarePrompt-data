Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, and the loop has terminated. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`. Otherwise, `l` and `r` are not equal, and `ans` remains 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0 or 1, and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - mi`, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is updated to `n - 2`, `ans` is 1, and the current value of `a[r + 1]` is 0. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is updated to 1, `ans` is 1, and the first element of `a` (`a[l]`) is 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to the remainder of `k` divided by 2, and `k` remains an integer greater than 0. If `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, and `mi` is the minimum value between the original `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - mi`, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is updated to 1 and `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `ans` is 0, 1, or 2. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to `k % 2`, and if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi`, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi` if `a[r]` is not 0, or `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi` and `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `a[r]` is 0. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is updated to 1 or 2, and `ans` is updated to 1, 2, 3, or 4 if `a[r]` is not 0, or 2, 3, 4, or 5 if `a[r]` is 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to `k % 2`, and if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is updated to 1, 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, 1, 2, or 3. In both cases, `l` must be less than `r`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
