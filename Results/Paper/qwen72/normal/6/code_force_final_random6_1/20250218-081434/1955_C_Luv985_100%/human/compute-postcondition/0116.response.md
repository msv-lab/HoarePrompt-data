Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, and `mi` is the minimum value between the original `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - mi`, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is updated to 1 and `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `ans` is 0, 1, or 2. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to `k % 2`, and if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
