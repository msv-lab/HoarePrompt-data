You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x ≠ y.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = abs(n - m)
        
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)
        
    #State: `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x ≠ y, `i` is the number of iterations specified by the input, `n` and `m` are the last input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, the state remains unchanged. If `n` == 0 and `m` is odd or even, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k`, and `q` is 2 raised to the power of (p - 1).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple pairs of integers from the user and prints a value based on the absolute difference between each pair. For each pair `(n, m)`, if the absolute difference `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`. If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, it prints 1. If `n` is 0 and `m` is even, it prints 2. Otherwise, it prints the difference between `k` and the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input parameters `x` and `y` mentioned in the annotations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the length of the longest common subsegment is flawed. The program uses the expression `k = abs(n - m)` to calculate the difference between `n` and `m`, and then checks if `k` is a power of 2 using `if k & k - 1 == 0`. However, this approach does not correctly identify the longest common subsegment for all possible values of `x` and `y`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the test case with `x = 1` and `y = 2`. The sequences `a` and `b` will be:
- `a = [1, 0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, ...]`
- `b = [2, 3, 0, 1, 6, 7, 4, 5, ...]`

The longest common subsegment here is `[1, 0, 3, 2]`, which has a length of 4. However, the program will output `1` for this test case, which is incorrect.

### Analysis:
The program's logic is based on the assumption that the length of the longest common subsegment is related to the difference `k = abs(n - m)`, but this is not always true. The correct approach involves understanding the properties of the XOR operation and how it affects the sequences `a` and `b`. The longest common subsegment can be determined by finding the highest power of 2 that divides the difference `k`, which is not correctly implemented in the given program.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
