Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\) and \(x \neq y\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `m` is an odd integer greater than 0.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, which is \(|n - m|\). Since `n` is 0 and `m` is an odd integer greater than 0, `k` will be equal to `m` (because \(|0 - m| = m\)).
   - `k` is not a power of 2.

2. **Code snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement in the code snippet simply prints the integer 1.
   - The values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` do not affect the execution of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1**
