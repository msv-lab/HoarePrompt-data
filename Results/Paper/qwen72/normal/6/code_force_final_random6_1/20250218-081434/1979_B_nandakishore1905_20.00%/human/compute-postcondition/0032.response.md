The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the input integer from `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than the input integer. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the input integer must be greater than 1.

State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are new input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `n` == 0 and `m` is odd or even, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k`, and `q` is 2 raised to the power of (p - 1). The input integer must be greater than 1.**
