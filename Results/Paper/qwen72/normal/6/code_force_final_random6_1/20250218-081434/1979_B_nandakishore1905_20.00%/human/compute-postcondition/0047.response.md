Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple pairs of integers from the user and prints a value based on the absolute difference between each pair. For each pair `(n, m)`, if the absolute difference `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`. If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, it prints 1. If `n` is 0 and `m` is even, it prints 2. Otherwise, it prints the difference between `k` and the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input parameters `x` and `y` mentioned in the annotations. **
