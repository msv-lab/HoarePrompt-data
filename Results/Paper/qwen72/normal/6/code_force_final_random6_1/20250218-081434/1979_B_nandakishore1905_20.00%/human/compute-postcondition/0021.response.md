Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are new input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.** 

The code snippet `k = abs(n - m)` calculates the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and assigns it to `k`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged. The conditions for `n` and `m` being greater than 0 and `x` and `y` being distinct non-negative integers within the specified range are still valid. The value of `k` is now the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, but no further conditions or calculations are applied in this snippet, so the output state reflects the updated value of `k` and retains all other initial conditions.
