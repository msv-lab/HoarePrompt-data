To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions given:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\) and \(x \neq y\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., \(k = |n - m|\).
   - `k` is a power of 2.

2. **Understanding `k`:**
   - Since `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `k` is a power of 2, `k` can be any value in the set \(\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, \ldots\}\).
   - The exact value of `k` depends on the specific values of `n` and `m` provided as input.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and is a power of 2.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific numerical value of `k`. However, we know that `k` will be a power of 2.

Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between n and m and is a power of 2)**
