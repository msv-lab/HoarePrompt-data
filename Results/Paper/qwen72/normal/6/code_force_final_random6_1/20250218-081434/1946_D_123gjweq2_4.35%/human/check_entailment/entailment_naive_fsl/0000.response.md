Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1` always calls `find_max` with a fixed bit length of 31, which does not take into account the value of `x`. This can lead to incorrect results when `x` has a different bit length.

For example, consider the test case:
```
n = 3, x = 1
arr = [1, 2, 3]
```
The correct output should be `2` (as explained in the problem description), but the program will not necessarily produce this output because it does not correctly handle the bitwise operations based on the value of `x`.

The function `find_max` should be called with the appropriate bit length based on the value of `x` to ensure that the bitwise operations are correctly evaluated. Additionally, the logic within `find_max` needs to be carefully reviewed to ensure it correctly handles the constraints and conditions specified in the problem description.
