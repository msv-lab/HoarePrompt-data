Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list that contains the first element of `cur_arr` if the bit at position `bit` in the first element of `cur_arr` is 0, otherwise `new_arr` contains the value of `xor`, `xor` is the result of `xor` XOR `i`, `thing1` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `new_arr.append(xor)` appends the value of `xor` to the list `new_arr`.
- `cur_arr`, `i`, `bit`, and `thing1` remain unchanged.
- The value of `xor` is updated to the result of `xor` XOR `i` before it is appended to `new_arr`.
- If the bit at position `bit` in the first element of `cur_arr` was 0, `new_arr` initially contained the first element of `cur_arr`. After the code execution, `new_arr` now contains the first element of `cur_arr` and the value of `xor`.
- If the bit at position `bit` in the first element of `cur_arr` was not 0, `new_arr` initially was an empty list. After the code execution, `new_arr` now contains the value of `xor`.
