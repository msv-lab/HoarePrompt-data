### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments `[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], ..., [l_k, r_k]` in an array `a` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to a given number `x`.
   - The segments must be contiguous and cover the entire array, with the first segment starting at index 1 and the last segment ending at index `n`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the number `x`.
   - It then reads the array `arr` and calls the function `func_1(arr, x)` to find the maximum number of segments.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calls `find_max(arr, 31)`, which is incorrect because the maximum value of `bit` should be 29 (since `x` is less than \(2^{30}\)).
   - The function `find_max` is supposed to recursively find the maximum number of segments by considering the bits of the XOR results.

4. **Function `find_max`**:
   - The function `find_max` takes a list `cur_arr` and an integer `bit`.
   - It initializes `new_arr` to store the XOR results where the bit at position `bit` is 0.
   - It iterates through `cur_arr`, updating `xor` with the current element.
   - If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, it appends `xor` to `new_arr` and resets `xor` to 0.
   - After the loop, it checks if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1. If it is, it sets `thing1` to -1. Otherwise, it recursively calls `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.
   - It then checks if the bit at position `bit` in `x` is 1. If it is, it returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`. Otherwise, it returns `thing1`.

5. **Issues**:
   - The initial call to `find_max` in `func_1` uses `31` as the bit position, which is incorrect. It should be `29` to match the problem constraints.
   - The function `find_max` does not correctly handle the condition where the bitwise OR of the XOR results exceeds `x`. It should ensure that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of the segments is less than or equal to `x`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it uses the wrong initial bit position and does not correctly handle the condition where the bitwise OR of the XOR results exceeds `x`.

**Correctness: False**
