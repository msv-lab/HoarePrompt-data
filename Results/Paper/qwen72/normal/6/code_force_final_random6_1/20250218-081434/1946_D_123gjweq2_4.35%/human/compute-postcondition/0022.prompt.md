Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, and bit is not equal to -1, new_arr is an empty list, xor is 0, thing1 is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in cur_arr:
    xor ^= i
    if not xor >> bit & 1:
        new_arr.append(xor)
        xor = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list that may contain the first element of `cur_arr` if the bit at position `bit` in `i` is 0, otherwise `new_arr` remains an empty list, `xor` is the result of `i` XOR `0` (which is `i`), and `thing1` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list that contains the first element of `cur_arr` if the bit at position `bit` in the first element of `cur_arr` is 0, otherwise `new_arr` remains an empty list, `xor` is 0 if the bit at position `bit` in the first element of `cur_arr` is 0, otherwise `xor` retains its original value, and `thing1` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list that contains the first element of `cur_arr` if the bit at position `bit` in the first element of `cur_arr` is 0, otherwise `new_arr` contains the value of `xor`. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, `xor` is set to 0 and `thing1` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
