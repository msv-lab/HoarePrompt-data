Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the values of `xor` at the end of each iteration where the bit at position `bit` in `xor` was 0, `xor` is 0 if the last element of `cur_arr` resulted in `xor` having the bit at position `bit` set to 0, otherwise `xor` is the final value after all elements of `cur_arr` have been processed, and `thing1` is 0. Additionally, the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0.**
