Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the values of `xor` at the end of each iteration where the bit at position `bit` in `xor` was 0, `xor` is 0 if the last element of `cur_arr` resulted in `xor` having the bit at position `bit` set to 0, otherwise `xor` is the final value after all elements of `cur_arr` have been processed, and `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`. Additionally, the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` updates the value of `thing1` to the result of the function `find_max` called with `new_arr` and `bit - 1` as arguments.
- The values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, `new_arr`, and `xor` remain unchanged.
- The bit at position `bit` in `xor` is still 0, as this condition was part of the initial state and is not affected by the code.
- The value of `thing1` is now the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.
