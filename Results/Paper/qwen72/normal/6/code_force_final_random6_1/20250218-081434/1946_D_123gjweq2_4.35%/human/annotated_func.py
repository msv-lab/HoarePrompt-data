#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find_max` accepts a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` (0 <= bit < 30). It returns the length of `cur_arr` if `bit` is -1. Otherwise, it processes the list `cur_arr` to create a new list `new_arr` containing the values of `xor` at the end of each iteration where the bit at position `bit` in `xor` was 0. If the bit at position `bit` in the final `xor` value is set to 1, the function returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`. If the bit at position `bit` in the final `xor` value is 0, the function returns the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.
