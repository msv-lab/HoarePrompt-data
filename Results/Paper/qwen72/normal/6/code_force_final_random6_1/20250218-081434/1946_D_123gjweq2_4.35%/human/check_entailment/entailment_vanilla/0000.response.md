### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of segments `[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], ..., [l_k, r_k]` such that:
     - `l_1 = 1`
     - `r_k = n`
     - `l_i <= r_i` for all `i` from 1 to `k`
     - `r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1}` for all `i` from 1 to `k - 1`
     - The bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments should be less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` calls `find_max` with the array `arr` and an initial bit value of 31.
   - This bit value is chosen because the maximum value of `x` is less than `2^30`, so we start from the highest bit (31st bit) and work our way down.

3. **Function `find_max` Analysis:**
   - **Base Case:** If `bit == -1`, it means we have processed all bits, and the function returns the length of `cur_arr`. This is the number of segments we have formed.
   - **New Array Construction:**
     - We initialize `new_arr` to store the XOR results of segments that do not set the current bit.
     - We iterate through `cur_arr` and compute the running XOR `xor`.
     - If the current bit of `xor` is not set (i.e., `xor >> bit & 1` is 0), we append `xor` to `new_arr` and reset `xor` to 0.
   - **Final Check:**
     - If the final `xor` has the current bit set, we set `thing1` to -1, indicating that the current segment cannot be valid.
     - Otherwise, we recursively call `find_max` with `new_arr` and the next bit (`bit - 1`).
   - **Bitwise OR Condition:**
     - If the current bit of `x` is set (i.e., `x >> bit & 1` is 1), we return the maximum of:
       - The result of `find_max` with the original array and the next bit.
       - The length of `new_arr`.
     - If the current bit of `x` is not set, we return `thing1`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly processes the array from the highest bit to the lowest bit.
   - It ensures that the segments formed do not set any bit that is not set in `x`.
   - The recursive calls and the base case handle the segmentation and bit checking correctly.
   - The final result is the maximum number of valid segments or -1 if no valid segments can be formed.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The algorithm handles the case where `x` is 0 by ensuring that no segment can set any bit.
   - It also handles the case where the entire array can be a single segment if the bitwise OR condition is met.
