Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each element `arr[i]` satisfies `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)`.
   - The length of `arr` is `n`, and `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.
   - `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `freq[j]` represents the number of times the integer `j` appears in `arr`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - If `freq[2]` is greater than or equal to 2, `freq[2]` is greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
   - If `freq[2]` is 1, `cou` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `cou` remains 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2 in the initial state.
   - The `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `i` is 2, the `print(i)` statement will print 2.

Output: **2**
