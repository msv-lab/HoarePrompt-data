Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for all `i`.
   - The length of `arr` is `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5).
   - `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `freq[j]` represents the number of times the integer `j` appears in `arr`.
   - `cou` is 0 or 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - If `freq[i]` is 1, `cou` is set to 1.
   - If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, the program continues to the next iteration or the next statement.
   - The current value of `cou` is 2 or the current value of `freq[i]` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly given as 0 in the initial state.
   - The value of `i` is not modified between the initial state and the print statement.
   - Therefore, the value of `i` that will be printed is 0.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `i`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
