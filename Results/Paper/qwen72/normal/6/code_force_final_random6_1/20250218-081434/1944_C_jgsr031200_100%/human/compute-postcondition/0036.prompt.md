Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where 0 <= `arr[i]` < len(`arr`) for all i, and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5). `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `freq[j]` represents the number of times the integer `j` appears in `arr`. `cou` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if freq[i] >= 2:
        continue
    if freq[i] == 1:
        cou += 1
    if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
        print(i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for all `i`, and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5). `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `freq[j]` represents the number of times the integer `j` appears in `arr`. `cou` is 0 or 1, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `freq[i]` is 1, `cou` is set to 1. If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, the program continues to the next iteration or the next statement. If `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for all `i`, and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5). `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `freq[j]` represents the number of times the integer `j` appears in `arr`. `cou` is 0 or 1, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration or statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for all `i`, and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5). `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `freq[j]` represents the number of times the integer `j` appears in `arr`. `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `freq[2]` is greater than or equal to 2, `freq[2]` is greater than 0 for the loop to continue. If `freq[2]` is 1, `cou` is 1. Otherwise, `cou` remains 0. If `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
