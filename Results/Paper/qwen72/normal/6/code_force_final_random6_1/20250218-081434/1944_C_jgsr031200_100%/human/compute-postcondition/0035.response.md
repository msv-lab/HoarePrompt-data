Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for all `i`, and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5). `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `freq[j]` represents the number of times the integer `j` appears in `arr`. `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `freq[2]` is greater than or equal to 2, `freq[2]` is greater than 0 for the loop to continue. If `freq[2]` is 1, `cou` is 1. Otherwise, `cou` remains 0. If `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
