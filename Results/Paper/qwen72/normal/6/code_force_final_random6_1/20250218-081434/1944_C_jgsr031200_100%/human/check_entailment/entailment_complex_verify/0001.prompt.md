You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

If the loop did not break early, `cou` is 0 or 1, and no integer `j` in the range `[0, n]` has a frequency of 0 or 2. If the loop broke early, `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0 for some `i` in the range `[0, n]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers, where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the list's length is between 1 and 200,000. It prints the first integer `i` in the range `[0, n]` that either appears exactly once in `arr` (if there are at least two such integers) or the first integer that does not appear in `arr` (if there are fewer than two integers that appear exactly once). If the loop completes without finding such an integer, it prints the last integer in the range `[0, n]` that has a frequency of 0 or 1. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and deleting them.
   - Alice appends the element to a new array `c` and wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob deletes the element from `a` and wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty, and the score is the MEX of `c`.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should always try to pick the smallest element that is not already in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should try to pick the smallest element that is not already in `c` to minimize the MEX, but he cannot append it to `c`.

3. **Frequency Analysis**:
   - The array `c` will eventually contain elements that are picked by Alice.
   - If an element appears at least twice in `a`, Bob can always pick one of the duplicates, and Alice can still pick the other.
   - If an element appears only once, Bob can pick it, and Alice will not be able to pick it.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - The program calculates the frequency of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the elements from 0 to `n` and checks:
     - If the frequency of the element is at least 2, it continues.
     - If the frequency of the element is 1, it increments a counter.
     - If the counter reaches 2 or the frequency of the element is 0, it prints the current element and breaks the loop.

5. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the frequency of each element in `a` using a list `freq`.
   - It then iterates through the elements from 0 to `n` and applies the logic described above.
   - The logic ensures that the first element that cannot be picked by both players (either because it appears only once or not at all) is the MEX of `c`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `a` is empty or contains only one element.
   - It also handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same.

7. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
