Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input for multiple test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each element in the array `arr` using a list `freq` of size `n + 1` (to account for elements from 0 to n-1).

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning Alice will try to maximize the MEX of the array `c` and Bob will try to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - The program iterates through the frequencies of the elements from 0 to n. If an element appears at least twice, it continues to the next element. If an element appears exactly once, it increments a counter `cou`. If the counter reaches 2 (indicating that two unique elements have been found) or if an element does not appear at all, it prints the current index `i` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the smallest integer that is not present in the array `c` after both players have played optimally.
   - If there are two unique elements, Alice can ensure that the MEX is at least 2 by choosing one of these unique elements, and Bob will be forced to choose the other unique element, leaving the MEX of `c` as 2.
   - If there is only one unique element, Alice can ensure that the MEX is at least 1 by choosing this unique element, and Bob will be forced to choose another element, leaving the MEX of `c` as 1.
   - If there are no unique elements, the MEX will be 0.

5. **Output**: The program correctly prints the MEX for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the optimal strategy for both players, the program's logic and implementation are correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
