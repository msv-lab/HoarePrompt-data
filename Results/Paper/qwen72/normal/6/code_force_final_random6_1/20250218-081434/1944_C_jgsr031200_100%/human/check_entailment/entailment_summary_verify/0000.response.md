### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem. Let's break down the issues and the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Game Logic and Optimal Strategy:**
   - The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to pick elements from the array `a` and append them to `c` (Alice) or delete them (Bob).
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The optimal strategy for both players is not straightforward and involves careful selection of elements to influence the MEX of `c`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` counts the frequency of each element in the array `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the range `[0, n]` and prints the first integer `i` where the frequency of `i` is less than 2.
   - This approach does not simulate the game turns or the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It simply finds the first integer that either does not appear or appears exactly once in `arr`.

3. **Example Case Analysis:**
   - **Input:**
     ```
     1
     5
     0 1 2 2 3
     ```
   - **Expected Output:**
     ```
     4
     ```
   - **Actual Output:**
     ```
     2
     ```
   - **Explanation:**
     - The array `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, 2, 3]`.
     - The optimal game could be:
       1. Alice picks `2` (since it appears twice and can be used to delay the MEX).
       2. Bob picks `0`.
       3. Alice picks `2` again.
       4. Bob picks `1`.
       5. Alice picks `3`.
     - The final array `c` would be `[2, 2, 3]`, and the MEX of `c` is `4`.
     - However, the provided program prints `2` because it incorrectly assumes that the MEX is the first index where the frequency of an element is less than 2.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game turns and consider the optimal strategies of both players.
   - Alice will try to pick elements that delay the appearance of smaller integers in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick elements that force the appearance of smaller integers in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - The correct approach involves a more complex simulation or a strategic algorithm to determine the final MEX of `c`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic to determine the MEX of `c` after both players have played optimally. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
