The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `arr` (through its length `n`). The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1 to ensure `i < n + 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented to 1.
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for all `i`, and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5). `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `freq[j]` represents the number of times the integer `j` appears in `arr`. `cou` is 0 or 1, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.**
