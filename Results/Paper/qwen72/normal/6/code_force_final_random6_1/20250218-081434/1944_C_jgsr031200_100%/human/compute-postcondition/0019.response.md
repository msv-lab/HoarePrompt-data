Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for all `i`, and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5). `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `freq[j]` represents the number of times the integer `j` appears in `arr`. `cou` is 0 or 1, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `freq[i]` is 1, `cou` is set to 1. If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, the program continues to the next iteration or the next statement. If `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
