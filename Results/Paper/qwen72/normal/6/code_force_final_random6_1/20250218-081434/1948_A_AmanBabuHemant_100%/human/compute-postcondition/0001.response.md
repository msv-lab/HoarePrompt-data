The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is being iterated over the range defined by `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` is an input integer, and it is mentioned that the function should handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50). However, `n` itself is not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted directly for the loop to execute. The loop will execute `t` times, and each iteration will handle a test case defined by `n`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1, and we do not need to adjust the state of `n` or any other variable that is not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
