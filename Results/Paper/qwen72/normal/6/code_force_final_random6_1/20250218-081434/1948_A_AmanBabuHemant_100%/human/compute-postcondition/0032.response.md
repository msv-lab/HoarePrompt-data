Output State: **`t` is 0, and for each input integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50) provided during the loop, if `n` is odd, "NO" was printed. If `n` is even and the length of the string `s` (constructed as 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times) is less than 200, "YES" followed by the string `s` was printed. If `n` is even and the length of the string `s` is 200 or more, "NO" was printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because it has been decremented by 1 for each iteration. For each input integer `n` given during the loop, the following conditions were checked and the corresponding output was printed:
- If `n` was odd, the output "NO" was printed.
- If `n` was even and the length of the string `s` (which is constructed by repeating 'AAB' `n // 2` times) was less than 200, the output "YES" followed by the string `s` was printed.
- If `n` was even and the length of the string `s` was 200 or more, the output "NO" was printed.
