Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and the function should be designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50). The function should return a string "NO" if no suitable string can be constructed, or a string "YES" followed by a valid string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters, and the length of the string should not exceed 200.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n % 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
        if len(s) < 200:
            print('YES')
            print(s)
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t` or `n`. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n` is even and the initial length of `s` was less than 200. The length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n` is even and the initial length of `s` was greater than or equal to 200.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1`), `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, `s` remains unchanged. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n` is even and the initial length of `s` was less than 200. The length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n` is even and the initial length of `s` was greater than or equal to 200.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1`), `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, `s` remains unchanged. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n` is even and the initial length of `s` was less than 200. The length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n` is even and the initial length of `s` was greater than or equal to 200.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
