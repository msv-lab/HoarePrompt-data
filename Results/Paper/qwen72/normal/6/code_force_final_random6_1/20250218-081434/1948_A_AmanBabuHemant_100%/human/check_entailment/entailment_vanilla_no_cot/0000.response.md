Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly addresses the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads the integer `n`.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**: If `n` is odd, the program prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where a special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because special characters must come in pairs (e.g., "AA", "BB").

3. **Even `n` Handling**: If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. This ensures that each 'A' in the pattern is a special character, and the total number of special characters is `n`.

4. **String Length Check**: The program checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If the length exceeds 200, it prints 'NO'. This is a valid check because the problem guarantees that if a solution exists, there is one of length at most 200.

5. **Output**: The program outputs the correct format for both 'NO' and 'YES' cases, as specified in the problem description.

Given these points, the program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem.
