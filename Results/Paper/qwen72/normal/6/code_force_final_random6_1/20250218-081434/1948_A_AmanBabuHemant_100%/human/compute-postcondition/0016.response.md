Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0, and it is now `t - 1`.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t` or `n`.
4. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
5. The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n` is even and the initial length of `s` was less than 200.
6. The length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n` is even and the initial length of `s` was greater than or equal to 200.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string 'NO'.
- The initial state and the conditions described do not affect the `print` statement directly because the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print 'NO' regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`.

Output: **NO**
