Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1`), `n` is an input integer, and `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. If the initial length of `s` was less than 200 and `n` is even, the length of `s` remains less than 200. If the initial length of `s` was greater than or equal to 200 and `n` is even, the length of `s` remains greater than or equal to 200.***
