The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). If `n` is odd, it prints "NO". If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern 'AAB' `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the string `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
