#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should return a string "NO" if no suitable string can be constructed, or a string "YES" followed by a valid string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, and the length of the string should not exceed 200.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is 0, and for each input integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50) provided during the loop, if `n` is odd, "NO" was printed. If `n` is even and the length of the string `s` (constructed as 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times) is less than 200, "YES" followed by the string `s` was printed. If `n` is even and the length of the string `s` is 200 or more, "NO" was printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). If `n` is odd, it prints "NO". If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern 'AAB' `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the string `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
