Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t` or `n`. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n` is even and the initial length of `s` was less than 200. The length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n` is even and the initial length of `s` was greater than or equal to 200.***
