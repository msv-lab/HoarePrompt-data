Reasoning:  
The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 50). The goal is to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly \( n \) special characters, where a special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program checks if \( n \) is odd or even. If \( n \) is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is part of a pair. If \( n \) is even, it constructs a string by repeating the pattern "AAB" \( n // 2 \) times, which ensures that each "A" in the pattern is a special character (since it is equal to one of its neighbors but not both). The program then checks if the length of the constructed string is less than 200. If it is, it prints "YES" followed by the string. If the length is 200 or more, it prints "NO".

However, there is a potential issue with the program's logic. The problem statement guarantees that if a suitable string exists, there will be a string of length at most 200. The program constructs a string of length \( 3 \times (n // 2) = 1.5 \times n \). Since \( n \) is at most 50, the maximum length of the string \( s \) is \( 1.5 \times 50 = 75 \), which is always less than 200. Therefore, the check `if len(s) < 200` is unnecessary and can be removed.

Given this, the program will always print "YES" followed by the string \( s \) when \( n \) is even, and "NO" when \( n \) is odd, which is correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
