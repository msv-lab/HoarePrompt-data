Output State: **`v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, `i` is `n + 1`, and `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i` for any `i` in the range from 1 to `n`. The program returns nothing.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` has reached the value `n + 1`, and the loop has checked all elements from `1` to `n` in the list `v`. For each of these elements, the condition `v[v[i]] == i` was never met, so the loop did not print `2` or return anything. The list `v` and the integer `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
