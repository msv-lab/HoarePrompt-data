Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `v` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - The first element of `v` is 0.
   - The remaining elements of `v` are integers provided by the user.
   - `n` is an input integer between 2 and 50.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i` for any `i` in the range from 1 to `n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(3)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the integer 3.
   - The initial state provides information about the list `v` and the integer `n`, but none of this information is used in the `print` statement.
   - The value of `i` is `n + 1`, but it is not referenced in the `print` statement.
   - The condition `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i` for any `i` in the range from 1 to `n` is also not relevant to the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the integer 3, regardless of the values of `v`, `n`, or `i`.

Output: **3**
