### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` with zeros and then reads the list of best friends, appending it to `v` starting from index 1. This is done to align the indices with the friend numbers, which is a correct approach.

3. **Checking for Mutual Best Friends:**
   - The program iterates through each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if `v[v[i]] == i`, which means if the best friend of `v[i]` is `i`. This condition correctly identifies mutual best friends.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns immediately. This is correct because inviting both mutual best friends will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

4. **Default Case:**
   - If no mutual best friends are found, the program prints `3`. This is based on the assumption that if there are no mutual best friends, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3.
   - However, this assumption is not always correct. For example, consider the case where `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`:
     - Inviting friends 1 and 2 will ensure that both come to the party because friend 1's best friend is 2, and friend 2's best friend is 3, who is invited. The correct answer should be `2` in this case, not `3`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness for Mutual Best Friends:**
  - The program correctly identifies and handles the case where there is a pair of mutual best friends and prints `2`.

- **Correctness for No Mutual Best Friends:**
  - The program incorrectly prints `3` in all cases where there are no mutual best friends. This is not always the minimum number of invitations needed. For example, in the case `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`, the correct answer should be `2`, but the program prints `3`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where there are no mutual best friends but it is still possible to invite fewer than 3 friends to ensure at least 2 come to the party.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
