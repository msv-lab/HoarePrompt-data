Output State: **The program returns nothing.** 

In the provided code snippet, there is no value or variable specified to be returned. The `return` statement is empty, which means the function will return `None` by default in Python. However, since the initial state and the code snippet do not indicate any specific operation or change to the variables, and the return statement is empty, the program effectively returns nothing.
