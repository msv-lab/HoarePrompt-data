The given Python code snippet is:
```python
print(2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `v` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - The first element of `v` is 0.
   - The remaining elements of `v` are integers provided by the user.
   - `n` is an input integer between 2 and 50.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement simply prints the integer `2`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects defined in the initial state. It directly prints the integer `2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2**
