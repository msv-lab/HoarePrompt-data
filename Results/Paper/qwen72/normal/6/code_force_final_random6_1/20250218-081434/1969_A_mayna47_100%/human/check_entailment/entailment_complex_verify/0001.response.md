### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - It reads the number of friends `n`.
   - It initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` with zeros.
   - It then reads the list of best friends and appends it to `v` starting from index 1. This is done to align the indices with the friend numbers.

3. **Checking for Mutual Best Friends:**
   - The program iterates through each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if `v[v[i]] == i`, which means if the best friend of `v[i]` is `i`. This condition indicates that friends `i` and `v[i]` are mutual best friends.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns immediately. This is correct because inviting both mutual best friends will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

4. **Default Case:**
   - If no mutual best friends are found, the program prints `3`. This is based on the assumption that if there are no mutual best friends, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3.
   - However, this assumption is not always correct. For example, consider the case where `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`:
     - Inviting friends 1, 2, and 3 will ensure that friends 1 and 2 come to the party, but inviting friends 1 and 2 alone will also ensure that both come to the party. The correct answer should be `2` in this case, not `3`.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The function `func_1` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list `p` of length `n` containing integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n; p_i ≠ i; all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. The function should calculate and return the minimum number of invitations needed for at least 2 friends to attend the party.
- **Inside `func_1`:**
  - The list `v` is correctly initialized and populated with the best friends' data.
  - The loop correctly checks for mutual best friends and prints `2` if such a pair is found.
  - If no mutual best friends are found, the program prints `3`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where there are no mutual best friends but it is still possible to invite fewer than 3 friends to ensure at least 2 come to the party. The program should be modified to handle this case correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**
