Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2.** 

The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2. The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates `n` to the value provided by the input. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The conditions for `word` are still pending based on the new value of `n`.
