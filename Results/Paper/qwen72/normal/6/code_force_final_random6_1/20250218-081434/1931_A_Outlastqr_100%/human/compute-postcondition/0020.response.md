Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `word` is an empty string.**

The code snippet provided does not change the values of `t`, `i`, or `n`. It only initializes `word` to an empty string, which was already specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only change being the explicit initialization of `word` to an empty string.
