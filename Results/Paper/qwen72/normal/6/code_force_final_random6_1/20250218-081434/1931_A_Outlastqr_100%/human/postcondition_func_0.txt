The function processes a number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing an encoded word. It prints a decoded word for each test case based on the value of `n`. If `n` > 52, the word is the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string followed by 'zz'. If `n` > 27 and `n` ≤ 52, the word is the string 'a' + the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string + 'z'. If `n` is 27, the word is 'aay'. If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), the word is 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3` in the `alphabet` string. The function does not return any value; it only prints the decoded words.
