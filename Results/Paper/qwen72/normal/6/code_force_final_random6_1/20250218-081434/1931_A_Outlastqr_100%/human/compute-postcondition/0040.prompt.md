Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should accept an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) as the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word. `alphabet` is set to 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    word = ''
    if n > 52:
        word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
    elif n > 27:
        word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
    elif n == 27:
        word = 'aay'
    else:
        word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
    print(word)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `word` is an empty string initially. If `n` > 52, `word` is the string formed by concatenating the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string with 'zz'. If `n` is less than or equal to 52 and `n` > 27, `word` is the string 'a' concatenated with the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string, and then concatenated with 'z'. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. If `n` is less than 27, `word` is 'aa' followed by the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer. If `n` > 52, `word` is the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string followed by 'zz'. If `n` > 27 and `n` <= 52, `word` is the string 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. Otherwise, if `n` <= 27, `word` is 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3` in the string `alphabet`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `word` is an empty string before the if-else block. If `n` > 52, `word` is the string formed by concatenating the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string with 'zz'. If `n` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. If `n` is between 2 and 26 (inclusive), `word` is 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3` in the string `alphabet`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
