The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is expected to handle an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing an encoded word. The function should return a list of results, where each result corresponds to the decoded word for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes a number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing an encoded word. It returns a list of decoded words, one for each test case.**
