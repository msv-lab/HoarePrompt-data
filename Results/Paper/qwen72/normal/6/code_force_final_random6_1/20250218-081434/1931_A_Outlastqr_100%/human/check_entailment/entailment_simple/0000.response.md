### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n` (3 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 78).
   - The alphabet is indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, ..., 'z' is 26.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and determines the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums to `n`.

3. **Breaking Down the Logic:**
   - **Case 1: `n > 52`**
     - If `n` is greater than 52, the program constructs the word by adding the character at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'.
     - This is correct because the maximum sum of two 'z' characters is 52 (26 + 26), so the first character must be the one that makes up the remaining value.
   - **Case 2: `n > 27` and `n <= 52`**
     - If `n` is between 28 and 52, the program constructs the word by adding 'a' followed by the character at index `n - 28` and then 'z'.
     - This is correct because the maximum sum of one 'z' character is 26, so the second character must make up the remaining value.
   - **Case 3: `n == 27`**
     - If `n` is exactly 27, the program constructs the word 'aay'.
     - This is correct because the only way to sum to 27 with three characters is 'a' (1) + 'a' (1) + 'y' (25).
   - **Case 4: `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive)**
     - If `n` is between 3 and 26, the program constructs the word 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3`.
     - This is correct because the smallest possible sum of three characters is 3 ('a' + 'a' + 'a'), and the third character must be the one that makes up the remaining value.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 3 (smallest possible sum) and 78 (largest possible sum).
   - The logic for each case ensures that the word is lexicographically smallest.

5. **Input and Output:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case correctly.
   - The output format matches the problem description, printing one word per test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word for each given sum `n` within the specified range. The edge cases are handled appropriately, and the output format is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
