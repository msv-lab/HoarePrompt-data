Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `word` is the string 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'.**

Explanation: The code concatenates the string 'a' with the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string and then appends 'z' to it. The resulting string is assigned to the variable `word`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
