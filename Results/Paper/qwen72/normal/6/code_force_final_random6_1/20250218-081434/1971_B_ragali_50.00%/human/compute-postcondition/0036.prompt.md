Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a new string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed; `i` is the integer value that is 1 more than the value it had at the end of the previous iteration; `a` is an empty set; `t` must be greater than `i` for the loop to execute again. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of the new `s` with the first half of the new `s`, and if `newstr` is not equal to the new `s`, then `newstr` is not equal to the new `s`. If `newstr` is equal to the new `s`, then `newstr` is equal to the new `s`. If `isreverse` is not equal to the new `s`, then `isreverse` is the reversed string of the new `s`. Otherwise, `isreverse` is equal to the new `s`. If the length of `a` is 1 or less, no changes are made to the new `s`, `i`, or `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    a.add(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed; `i` will be set to each character in `s` during the loop; `a` is a set that contains all unique characters from `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed; `i` is the first character of `s`; `a` is a set that contains the first character of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string of length at least 2 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed; `i` is the second character of `s`; `a` is a set that contains the first character of `s` and the second character of `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
