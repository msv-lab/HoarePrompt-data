Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed; `i` is 1 greater than the last integer value of `i` used in the loop; `a` is an empty set; if `len(a) > 1`, then `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`, and `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `newstr` is not equal to `s`. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `newstr` is equal to `s`. If `len(a) == 1`, then `a` contains exactly one unique character. `t` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    a.add(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s`; `i` has taken on the values of the characters in `s` during the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s` including the next character `i`; `i` will take on the next character in `s` after the current one.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s` including the next character `i` and the current character `i`; `i` is the next character in `s` after the current one.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
