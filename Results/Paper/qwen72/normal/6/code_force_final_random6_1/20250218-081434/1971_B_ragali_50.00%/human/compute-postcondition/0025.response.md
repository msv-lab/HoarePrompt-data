Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed.
- `i` is the last character of `s`.
- `a` contains all unique characters from `s`.
- The length of `a` is 1 or less.

### Analysis:
1. **String `s`**:
   - `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with no leading or trailing spaces.
   - The length of `s` is at most 10.

2. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is the last character of `s`.
   - If `s` is empty, `i` will be an empty string.

3. **Variable `a`**:
   - `a` contains all unique characters from `s`.
   - The length of `a` is 1 or less, meaning `s` can have at most one unique character.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
- The code snippet is a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'NO'`.
- The values of `s`, `i`, and `a` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement is not dependent on any of these variables.

### Output:
Output: **NO**
