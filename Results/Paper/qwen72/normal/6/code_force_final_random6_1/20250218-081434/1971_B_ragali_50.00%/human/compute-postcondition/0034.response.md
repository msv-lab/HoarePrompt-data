The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first character of `s`, and `a` is a set that contains this first character.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `s` must be considered. Since `i` is the loop variable that takes on the value of each character in `s` in sequence, `i` should now be the second character of `s`. The length of `s` is at most 10, and it is non-empty, so for the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 2 characters.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at least 2 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed; `i` is the second character of `s`; `a` is a set that contains the first character of `s`**.
