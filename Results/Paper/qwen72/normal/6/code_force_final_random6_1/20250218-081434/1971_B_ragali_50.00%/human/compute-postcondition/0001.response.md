The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `t` must be such that it is a positive integer to ensure the loop runs at least once. The variable `i` will start at 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, each string `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters**
