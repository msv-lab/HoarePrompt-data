You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and each string s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is reduced to 0, and the loop has processed `t` strings `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, each stripped of leading and trailing spaces. For each string `s` processed, a set `a` containing all unique characters from `s` was created. If the length of `a` was greater than 1, the program printed 'YES' and then printed either the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half, the reversed string of `s`, or the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half again, depending on which condition was met. If the length of `a` was 1 or less, the program printed 'NO' for that string. The variable `i` has taken on the values of all characters in each string `s` during the loop, and the variable `a` has been reset for each new string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from user input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. It then processes `t` strings, each of length at most 10 and consisting of lowercase English letters, also read from user input. For each string `s`, it checks if the string contains more than one unique character. If so, it prints 'YES' and then prints a modified version of the string: either the string formed by concatenating the second half with the first half, the reversed string, or the string formed by concatenating the second half with the first half again, depending on which condition is met first. If the string contains one or fewer unique characters, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` strings, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the string `s`.

2. **Set Creation**:
   - The program creates a set `a` to store unique characters from the string `s`.
   - This is done to check if the string contains more than one unique character.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - If the length of the set `a` is greater than 1, it means the string `s` has more than one unique character, and it is possible to rearrange the string to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`.
   - If the length of the set `a` is 1, it means the string `s` consists of the same character repeated, and it is impossible to rearrange it to form a different string. In this case, the program correctly outputs "NO".

4. **Rearrangement Logic**:
   - The program attempts to rearrange the string `s` in three different ways:
     - `newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]`: This splits the string into two halves and swaps them.
     - `isreverse = s[::-1]`: This reverses the string.
     - `s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2]`: This is a redundant check, as it is the same as the first rearrangement.
   - The program checks if any of these rearrangements are different from the original string `s`:
     - If `newstr` is different from `s`, it prints `newstr`.
     - If `newstr` is the same as `s` but `isreverse` is different, it prints `isreverse`.
     - If both `newstr` and `isreverse` are the same as `s`, it prints `newstr` again (which is the same as the first rearrangement).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the string `s` has only one unique character correctly by outputting "NO".
   - The program also handles the case where the string `s` has more than one unique character and can be rearranged correctly.

6. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "YES" followed by the rearranged string if a valid rearrangement is found.
   - It outputs "NO" if no valid rearrangement is possible.

### Correctness:
- The program is generally correct in its logic and handles the given problem requirements.
- However, the third rearrangement check `s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2]` is redundant and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.
