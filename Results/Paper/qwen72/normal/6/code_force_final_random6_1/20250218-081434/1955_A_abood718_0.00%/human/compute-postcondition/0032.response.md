The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates within a context where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers with specific ranges. The function is expected to return a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function operates within a context where it processes `t` test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
