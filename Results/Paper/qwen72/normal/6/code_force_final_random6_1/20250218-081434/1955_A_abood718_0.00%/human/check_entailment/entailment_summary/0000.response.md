Reasoning:  
The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts, given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. However, there are a few issues in the program that need to be addressed:

1. **Variable Naming**: The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` are used in the program, but according to the problem description, they should be `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. This is a minor issue but can lead to confusion.

2. **Logic for Odd `n`**: When `n` is odd, the program prints `X` (which is `n // 2`) and then prints `X * C + B`. This is incorrect because the program should only print the final result, not an intermediate value.

3. **Correct Calculation for Odd `n`**: When `n` is odd, the correct calculation should be to buy `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotional price and 1 additional yogurt at the regular price. The final result should be `X * C + B`.

4. **Output Format**: The program should only print the final result for each test case, not intermediate values.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            X = n // 2
            if n % 2 == 0:
                print(X * b)
            else:
                print(X * b + a)
```

Given the issues in the original program, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
