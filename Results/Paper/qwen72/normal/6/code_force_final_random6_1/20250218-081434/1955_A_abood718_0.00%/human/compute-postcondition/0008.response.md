Output State: **`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `A`, `B`, and `C` are the values input by the user, split by spaces, `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, `A` is an odd integer, `X` is `A // 2`.**

Explanation:
- `X` is assigned the value of `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.
- Since `A` is an odd integer, `X` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `A / 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
