Initial State: `i` is 2, `A`, `B`, and `C` are the integers input by the user, split by spaces. If `B * 2 < C`, there are no changes to the variables. Otherwise, if `A` is even, there are no changes to the variables. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`. The input range must be greater than 1.

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

1. The line `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input, splits them by spaces, and assigns them to `A`, `B`, and `C`.
2. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
3. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are now the specific integers provided by the user.
4. The condition `B * 2 < C` is checked. If this condition is true, no further changes are made to the variables.
5. If `B * 2 < C` is false, the next condition `A % 2 == 0` is checked. If `A` is even, no further changes are made to the variables.
6. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `A`, `B`, and `C` are the integers input by the user, split by spaces. If `B * 2 < C`, there are no changes to the variables. Otherwise, if `A` is even, there are no changes to the variables. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**
