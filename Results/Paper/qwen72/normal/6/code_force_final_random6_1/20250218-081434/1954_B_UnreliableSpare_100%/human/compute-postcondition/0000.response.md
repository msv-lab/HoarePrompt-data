Output State: **The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the provided function definition does not include any. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, and the array `a` itself. The input should be such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, with the additional constraint that the array `a` is beautiful in every test case, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5. `n` is an input integer.**
