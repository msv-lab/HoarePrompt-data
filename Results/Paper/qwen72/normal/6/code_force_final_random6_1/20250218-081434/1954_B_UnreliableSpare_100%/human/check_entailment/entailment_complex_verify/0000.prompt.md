You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the provided function definition does not include any. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, and the array `a` itself. The input should be such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, with the additional constraint that the array `a` is beautiful in every test case, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.

    n = int(input())

    #State: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, and `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index where the first inequality was found.

        if arr[i] == val:

    #State: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index where the first inequality was found, `ans` is the minimum of the lengths of consecutive sequences of `val` in `arr` if any inequality was found, otherwise `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity'), `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is the length of the last consecutive sequence of `val` in `arr` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `cnt` is 0.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: *`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `val` is `arr[0]`. If `flag` is True, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the minimum of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is the length of the last consecutive sequence of `val` in `arr`. If `flag` is False, `i` is the index where the first inequality was found, `ans` is the minimum of the lengths of consecutive sequences of `val` in `arr`, and `cnt` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the input. It checks if all elements in `arr` are equal. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the first element in `arr` and prints this value. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is not entirely composed of the same elements but still meets the criteria of being a beautiful array. Specifically, the program is only checking for the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element (`arr[0]`). This approach is flawed because it does not consider other elements that might also form sequences that can be reduced to make the array non-beautiful.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The expected output is `1`, as removing the last element (or any other element that is `1`) will make the array non-beautiful. However, the program will output `3` because it only considers the minimum count of consecutive `1`s starting from the first element, which is `3` (the first three elements).

This shows that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and thus is incorrect.
