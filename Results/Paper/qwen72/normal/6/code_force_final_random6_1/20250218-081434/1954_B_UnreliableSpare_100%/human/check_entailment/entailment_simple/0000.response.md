Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling the `func_1` function. However, the function `func_1` does not take any parameters, which is a design flaw. Ideally, the function should take the array and its length as parameters, but since the function reads the input directly, it is still functional for the given problem.

2. **Checking if All Elements are Equal**: The program checks if all elements in the array are equal by iterating through the array and setting a `flag` to `False` if any two consecutive elements are not equal. This is a valid approach to determine if the array is composed entirely of the same element.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove**: The program then tries to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It does this by iterating through the array and counting the length of consecutive sequences of the first element (`arr[0]`). If a different element is found, it updates the minimum count of consecutive sequences. Finally, it updates the minimum count with the length of the last sequence.

4. **Output**: If the `flag` is `True`, it means all elements are the same, and the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, so it prints `-1`. If the `flag` is `False`, it prints the minimum count of elements to remove.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For an array of length 1, the program correctly prints `-1` because a single-element array is always beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful.
   - For an array where all elements are the same, the program correctly prints `-1`.
   - For an array with different elements, the program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simpler `float('inf')` or a large integer like `10**9`.
   - The program does not handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful (i.e., no operation can make all elements the same). However, the problem statement guarantees that the input array is always beautiful, so this is not a concern.

Given the problem constraints and the provided states, the program appears to correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
