Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, `ans` is 0, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0, and `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`.**

The value of `cnt` is set to 0, and all other variables remain unchanged. The initial condition that `arr[i]` is not equal to `val` still holds, and `val` is still the value at `arr[0]`. The state of `flag` is determined by the condition that all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0. The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `ans`, and `val` remain as they were in the initial state.
