Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by calling the `func_1` function. However, the function `func_1` is called without passing any arguments, which is incorrect. The function should be defined to accept the number of test cases, the length of the array, and the array itself as parameters.

2. **Checking All Elements Equal**: The program checks if all elements in the array are equal by iterating through the array and setting a flag `flag` to `False` if any element is not equal to the previous one. This is a correct approach to determine if the array is composed of identical elements.

3. **Finding Minimum Consecutive Sequence Length**: The program then calculates the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the first element in the array. This is intended to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the condition that makes the array beautiful. However, this approach is flawed because it only considers consecutive sequences of the first element, and it does not correctly handle the case where the array is beautiful but not composed of identical elements.

4. **Output**: The program prints `-1` if all elements are equal (which is correct because an array of identical elements cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements). If not, it prints the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the first element. This is incorrect because it does not consider the correct condition for breaking the beauty of the array.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will output `1`, which is correct. However, if the array is `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program will output `3`, which is correct, but the logic is not robust enough to handle all cases.

6. **Logical Flaw**: The program fails to correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition. It only considers sequences of the first element, which is not sufficient. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program should consider removing the middle element to break the beauty condition, but it does not.

Given these points, the program is not correct for all cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
