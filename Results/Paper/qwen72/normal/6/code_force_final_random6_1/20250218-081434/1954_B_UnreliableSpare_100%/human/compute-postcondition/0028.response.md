Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
- If `cnt` is 0, `ans` will be 0 because 0 is the minimum value.
- If `cnt` is 1 and `ans` was previously `Decimal('Infinity')`, `ans` will be 1.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `flag`, and `val` remain unchanged.
