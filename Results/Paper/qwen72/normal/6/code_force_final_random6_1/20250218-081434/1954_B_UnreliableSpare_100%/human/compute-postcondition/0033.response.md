Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 2 if `arr[1]` is equal to `val`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value (`Decimal('Infinity')`) and the value of `cnt`.
- If `arr[1]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 2, and `ans` becomes 2.
- If `arr[1]` is not equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 0, and `ans` becomes 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `arr`, `flag`, `val`) remain unchanged.
