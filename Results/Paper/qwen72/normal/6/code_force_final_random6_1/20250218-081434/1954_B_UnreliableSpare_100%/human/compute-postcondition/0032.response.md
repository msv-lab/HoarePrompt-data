Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 3 if `arr[1]` is equal to `val`, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity') if `arr[1]` is equal to `val`, otherwise `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`.**
