Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed when the `print` statement executes.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer, which represents the length of the list `arr`.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from input.
- `flag` is `True`.
- `i` is `n-1`, which means `i` is the index of the last element in the list `arr`.
- `ans` is the minimum of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt`.
- `val` is `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the list `arr`.
- `cnt` is the length of the last consecutive sequence of `val` in `arr`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
- The values of `n`, `arr`, `flag`, `i`, `ans`, `val`, and `cnt` are not directly used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print `-1`, regardless of the values of the variables and objects described in the initial state.

Output: **-1**
