Postcondition: **_ is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations. If `k` is not 0, `ans` is increased by `k // n` and `res` is increased by `k % n`. If `k` is 0, `ans` and `res` remain unchanged.**
