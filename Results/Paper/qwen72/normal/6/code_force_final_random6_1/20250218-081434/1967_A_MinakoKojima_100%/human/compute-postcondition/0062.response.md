Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations, `res` is the final value after all iterations, and `k` is not 0 (it is the remaining value after the last iteration).**
