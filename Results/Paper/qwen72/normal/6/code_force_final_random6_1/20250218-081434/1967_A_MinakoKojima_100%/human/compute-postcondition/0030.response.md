Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a`, `dif` is equal to `a[2] - a[1]`. If `dif` is not 0, `res` remains equal to `n - 1`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is equal to `n - 2`. If `k` is 0 and `dif` is not 0, `ans` is set to the first element of `a`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
