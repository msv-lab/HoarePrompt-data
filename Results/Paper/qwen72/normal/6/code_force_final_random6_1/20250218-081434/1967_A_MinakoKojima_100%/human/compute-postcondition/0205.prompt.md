Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins available to buy new cards, respectively. a is a list of n integers, each a_i where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the number of cards of type i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5. `ans_list` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = a[0]
    res = n - 1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
        if dif == 0:
            res -= 1
        if dif != 0:
            if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                ans += dif
                k -= dif * (i + 1)
                res -= 1
            else:
                ans += k // (i + 1)
                if i != 0:
                    res += k % (i + 1)
                k = 0
                break
            if k == 0:
                break
    if k != 0:
        ans += k // n
        res += k % n
    ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
    ans += res
    ans_list.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `res` is the final value after all iterations plus `k % n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains the final value after all iterations, `k` is 0 or the remaining value after the last iteration, `ans_list` contains the value of `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `res` is the final value after all iterations plus `k % n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `res` is the final value after all iterations, `k` is 0 or the remaining value after the last iteration, `ans_list` contains the value of `a[0]` and the final value of `ans` after the update, and `ans_list` now has one more element, which is the current value of `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `res` is increased by `k % n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `ans_list` now contains `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
