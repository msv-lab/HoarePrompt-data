Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations plus `k // n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `ans` remains the final value after all iterations. `res` is the final value after all iterations plus `k % n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains the final value after all iterations. `k` is 0 or the remaining value after the last iteration.***
