Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a` plus `dif`, `dif` is equal to `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` remains equal to `n - 1` if `dif` is not 0, otherwise `res` is equal to `n - 2`, `k` is now `k - dif * (i + 1)` which simplifies to `k - dif * 2`.**
