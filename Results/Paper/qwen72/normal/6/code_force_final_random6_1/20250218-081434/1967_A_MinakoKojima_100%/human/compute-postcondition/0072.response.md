Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `res` is the final value after all iterations plus `k % n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains the final value after all iterations, `k` is 0 or the remaining value after the last iteration, `ans_list` contains the value of `ans`.**

The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
