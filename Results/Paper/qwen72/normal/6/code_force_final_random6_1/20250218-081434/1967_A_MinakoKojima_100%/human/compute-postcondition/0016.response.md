Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is now equal to `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a` plus `dif`, `i` is 0, `dif` is the difference between the second and the first element of `a`, `dif` is not 0, `res` is equal to `n - 2`.**

The value of `res` is decremented by 1, so it is now `n - 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
