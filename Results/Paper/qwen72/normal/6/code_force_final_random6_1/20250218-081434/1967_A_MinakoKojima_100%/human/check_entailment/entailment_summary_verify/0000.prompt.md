You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

- Program:
import math

def func():
    ans_list = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        ans = a[0]
        res = n - 1
        for i in range(n - 1):
            dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
            if dif == 0:
                res -= 1
            if dif != 0:
                if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                    ans += dif
                    k -= dif * (i + 1)
                    res -= 1
                else:
                    ans += k // (i + 1)
                    if i != 0:
                        res += k % (i + 1)
                    k = 0
                    break
                if k == 0:
                    break
        if k != 0:
            ans += k // n
            res += k % n
        ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
        ans += res
        ans_list.append(ans)
    for a in ans_list:
        print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by the number of distinct types of cards `n`, the number of coins available `k`, and a list `a` of the number of cards of each type. For each test case, it calculates the maximum number of distinct types of cards that can be obtained by using the available coins to buy additional cards. The function then prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that `t` results are printed, where `t` is the number of test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of coins `k` is large enough to ensure that the minimum number of cards for each type can be increased to the point where all card counts are equal to or greater than `n`. This is a critical edge case that the program fails to handle correctly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 9
1 2 3
```
The expected output should be `22`, but the program outputs `21`.

Here's why:
- The initial counts of cards are `[1, 2, 3]`.
- We have 9 coins, which means we can buy 9 additional cards.
- The optimal strategy is to increase the counts of the cards to `[4, 4, 4]` by buying 3 cards of type 1, 2 cards of type 2, and 4 cards of type 3.
- This results in a total of 12 cards, and the number of subarrays of length 3 that are permutations of `[1, 2, 3]` is `10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 22`.

However, the program does not correctly handle the distribution of the remaining coins after the initial adjustments, leading to an incorrect result.
