Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 2, `dif` is equal to `a[3] - a[2]`, `k` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
