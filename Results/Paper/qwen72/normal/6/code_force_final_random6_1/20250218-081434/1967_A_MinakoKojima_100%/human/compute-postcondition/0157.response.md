Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is the first element of `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`, `dif` is not 0, `res` is `n - 1`. If `i` is not 0, `res` is `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`. `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`.**
