Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is 0, `ans` is `a[0]`, `res` is `n - 1`, `k` is 0 or the remaining value after the last iteration, `ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]` calculates the difference between the second element and the first element of the sorted list `a`.
- Since `i` is 0, `a[i + 1]` refers to `a[1]` and `a[i]` refers to `a[0]`.
- Therefore, `dif` is assigned the value `a[1] - a[0]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
