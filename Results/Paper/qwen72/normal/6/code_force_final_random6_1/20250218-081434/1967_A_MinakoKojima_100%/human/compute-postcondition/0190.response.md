Postcondition: ***`_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`. If `i` is not 0 and `dif` is 0, `res` is `res - 1 + k % 3`. If `i` is not 0 and `dif` is not 0, `res` is `res + k % 3`. In both cases, `ans` is increased by `k // 3`. If `i` is 0, the variables remain unchanged.***
