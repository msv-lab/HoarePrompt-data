Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it calculates the threshold `s` to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins. The approach used in the loop to increment `s` does not correctly simulate the casino's betting rules and the promotion of not losing more than `x` times in a row.

To correctly determine if Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row and then wins once. This cycle can be repeated to ensure that Sasha can always recover and eventually reach any desired number of coins.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to ensure recovery
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s = s * k
        s = s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
```

Explanation:
1. **Initial Bet**: Sasha starts with a bet of 1 coin.
2. **Worst-Case Recovery**: If Sasha loses `x` times in a row, he will need to have enough coins to recover after the `x`-th loss. The amount of coins needed after `x` losses can be calculated as \( s = k^x \).
3. **Recovery Calculation**: After `x` losses, Sasha needs to win once to recover. The total number of coins needed to ensure recovery is \( s = \frac{k^x}{k-1} + 1 \).

This ensures that Sasha can always recover from the worst-case scenario and continue betting, eventually reaching any desired number of coins. The original solution does not correctly account for this recovery mechanism.
