Output State: **`n` and `m` are the new input integers, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2`, and the current value of `g` is less than `countmins`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
