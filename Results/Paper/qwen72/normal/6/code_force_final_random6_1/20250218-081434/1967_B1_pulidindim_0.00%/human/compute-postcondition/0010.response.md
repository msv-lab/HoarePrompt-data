Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is equal to `n / 2`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
