You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input. It then calculates a value `ans` based on `n` and `m` using a specific formula and prints the integer value of `ans`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `m` are the final input integers for the last test case, `t` is the total number of test cases, `i` is `t - 1`, `count` is `m + 1`, and `ans` is the final calculated value for the last test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), it must be true that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - This implies that \(\frac{a + b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\) must be an integer.
   - Simplifying, we get \(\frac{a}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} + \frac{1}{\gcd(a, b)}\) must be an integer.
   - Since \(\gcd(a, b)\) divides both \(a\) and \(b\), let \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(d = \gcd(a, b)\) and \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\).
   - The condition becomes \(\frac{d \cdot a' + d \cdot b'}{d \cdot b' \cdot d} = \frac{a' + b'}{b' \cdot d}\) must be an integer.
   - This simplifies to \(\frac{a' + b'}{b' \cdot d}\) must be an integer, which means \(a' + b'\) must be a multiple of \(b' \cdot d\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided program initializes the count of valid pairs to \(n\) (which is correct because for \(b = 1\), \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\) and \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1\)).
   - It then iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values by considering the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The program uses a variable `countmins` which is set to `count - 1` (i.e., \(b - 1\)).
   - It then calculates \(g = \frac{n}{b}\) and checks if \(g < countmins\). If true, it breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates the answer by adding \(\frac{g - countmins}{b} + 1\) to `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The initial value of `ans` being set to \(n\) is correct because all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid.
   - The loop correctly iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 2 to \(m\).
   - The condition \(g < countmins\) is used to break the loop early if no more valid pairs can be found, which is a valid optimization.
   - The update to `ans` is based on the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\), but the formula \(\frac{g - countmins}{b} + 1\) is not entirely clear and may not correctly count all valid pairs.

5. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula \(\frac{g - countmins}{b} + 1\) is intended to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b\).
   - However, this formula does not accurately capture the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) because it does not account for the \(\gcd(a, b)\) condition properly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count all valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. The formula used in the loop is not accurate for the problem's requirements.
