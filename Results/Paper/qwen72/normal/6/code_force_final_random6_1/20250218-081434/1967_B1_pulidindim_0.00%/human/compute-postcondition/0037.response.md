Output State: **`n` and `m` are the input integers, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / m - (m - 1)`, and `m` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

The value of `countmins` is updated to 1, which is the result of `count - 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
