Output State: **`n` and `m` are the input integers, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n + sum((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1 for k in range(2, m + 1) if (n / k - (k - 1)) >= (k - 1))`, `countmins` is `m`, `g` is equal to `n / m - (m - 1)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.**
