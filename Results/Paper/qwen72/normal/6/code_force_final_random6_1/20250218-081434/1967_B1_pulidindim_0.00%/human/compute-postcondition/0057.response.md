Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are the input integers, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 5, `countmins` is 4, and `g` is `n / 5`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `countmins`, and `g` remain unchanged, and `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (g / 5 + 1)`.***
