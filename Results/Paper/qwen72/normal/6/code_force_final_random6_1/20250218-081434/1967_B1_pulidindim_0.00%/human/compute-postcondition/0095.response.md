The function `func` does not have any parameters listed in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints given, it seems that the function should accept two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. Since the output is not specified, we cannot determine the exact return value. However, we can describe the expected parameters.

Functionality: **The function is expected to accept two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The return value is not specified.**
