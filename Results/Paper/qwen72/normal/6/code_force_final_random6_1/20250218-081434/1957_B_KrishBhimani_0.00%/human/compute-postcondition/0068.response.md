Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 8 (using integer division) and must be greater than 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 3, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements being zeros. If `k0` was odd, `arr` contains `[0, 1, 2]`. If `k0` was even, `arr` contains `[1, 2]`.**
