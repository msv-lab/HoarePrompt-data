Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `k` to a new variable `k0`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `k0` now holds the same integer value as `k`, which is the integer value of the second element in the list `l1`.
