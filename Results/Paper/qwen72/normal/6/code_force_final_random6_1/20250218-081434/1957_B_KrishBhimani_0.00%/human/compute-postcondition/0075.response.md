Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least one element, `ans` is a list containing the value `k0`, `c` is 0, and `c` is equal to `n - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
