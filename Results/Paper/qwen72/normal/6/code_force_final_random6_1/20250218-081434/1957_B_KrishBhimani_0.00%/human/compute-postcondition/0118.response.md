Output State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, `c` is the number of iterations, and `ans` is an empty list.**

The code snippet `ans = []` initializes `ans` as an empty list, overriding its previous value. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
