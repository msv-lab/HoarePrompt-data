Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 8 (using integer division) and must be greater than 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements being zeros. If `k0` was odd, `arr` contains `[0, 1, 2]`. If `k0` was even, `arr` contains `[1, 2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by performing a right shift operation (`k = k >> 1`), which is equivalent to dividing `k` by 2 using integer division.
- Since `k` was initially the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 4, after the right shift, `k` is now the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 8.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `l1`, `n`, `k0`, `i`, `ans`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
