Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `c` is the number of elements in `arr`.
2. `ans` contains the values `1 << i` for each index `i` in `arr` up to `n-1` elements.
3. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` also contains an additional element which is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`.
4. `ans` is now a list of length `n`, with the remaining elements (if any) being zeros.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(*ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the length of `ans`**:
   - `ans` is a list of length `n`.
   - The first `c` elements of `ans` are `1 << i` for each index `i` in `arr`.
   - If `c` equals `n - 1`, the `n`-th element of `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`.
   - Any remaining elements (if `c < n - 1`) are zeros.

2. **Construct `ans`**:
   - For each index `i` in `arr`, the value `1 << i` is a left shift operation, which is equivalent to `2^i`.
   - If `c` equals `n - 1`, the last element of `ans` is calculated as `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`.

3. **Print `ans`**:
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `arr = [0, 1, 2]` and `n = 4`, `k0 = 15`.
  - `c = len(arr) = 3`.
  - The first `c` elements of `ans` are:
    - `1 << 0 = 1`
    - `1 << 1 = 2`
    - `1 << 2 = 4`
  - Since `c = 3` and `n = 4`, the last element of `ans` is:
    - `k0 - sum([1, 2, 4]) = 15 - 7 = 8`
  - Therefore, `ans = [1, 2, 4, 8]`.

- Suppose `arr = [0, 1]` and `n = 5`, `k0 = 10`.
  - `c = len(arr) = 2`.
  - The first `c` elements of `ans` are:
    - `1 << 0 = 1`
    - `1 << 1 = 2`
  - Since `c < n - 1`, the remaining elements are zeros:
    - `ans = [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]`.

### General Description:
- The first `c` elements of `ans` are `2^i` for each index `i` in `arr`.
- If `c` equals `n - 1`, the last element of `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`.
- Any remaining elements (if `c < n - 1`) are zeros.

### Final Output:
Output: **[2^i for each index i in arr, followed by k0 - sum([2^i for each index i in arr]) if c equals n-1, and then zeros for the remaining elements if any]**
