Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least one element, `ans` is a list containing the value `k0`, `c` is 0, and `c` is equal to `n - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`.
- Initially, `ans` is an empty list, so `sum(ans)` is 0.
- Therefore, the value appended to `ans` is `k0 - 0`, which is just `k0`.
- After this operation, `ans` contains the value `k0`.
- All other variables remain unchanged, so their initial states are still valid.
