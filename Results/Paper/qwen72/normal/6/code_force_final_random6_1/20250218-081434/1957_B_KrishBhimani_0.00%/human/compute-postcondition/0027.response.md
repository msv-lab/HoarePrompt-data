Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least one element, `ans` is a list containing the value `k0`, `c` is an integer such that `c` equals `n - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`.
- Initially, `ans` is an empty list, so `sum(ans)` is 0.
- Therefore, `k0 - sum(ans)` simplifies to `k0 - 0`, which is just `k0`.
- After executing the code, `ans` contains the value `k0`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `arr`, `c`) remain unchanged.
