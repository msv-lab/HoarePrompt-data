The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `k` must be non-zero.

Since `k` is already defined as the integer value of the second element in `l1`, and for the loop to execute, `k` must be non-zero, we need to ensure that the second element in `l1` is a non-zero integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` and must be non-zero, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` and must be non-zero, `i` is 0**
