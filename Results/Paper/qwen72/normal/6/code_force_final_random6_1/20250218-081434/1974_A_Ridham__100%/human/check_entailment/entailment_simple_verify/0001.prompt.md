You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

For each test case, if `space_x` (which is `x`) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells` (which is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`), `result` contains the value of `screen_require_for_y` (which is `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd). If `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `result` contains the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells` and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to place `x` applications with 1x1 icons and `y` applications with 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens.
   - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means each screen has 15 cells.
   - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of screens used.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `y`.
   - It calculates the total space required for 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).
   - It calculates the total space required for 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`).
   - It then determines the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons:
     - If `y` is even, the number of screens required is `y // 2`.
     - If `y` is odd, the number of screens required is `y // 2 + 1`.
   - It calculates the remaining cells on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons (`remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`).
   - If the remaining cells are enough to place all the 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), it appends the number of screens required for 2x2 icons to the result.
   - If the remaining cells are not enough, it calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells` is the space still needed for 1x1 icons.
     - If `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, the additional screens required is `extra_space // 15`.
     - Otherwise, it is `extra_space // 15 + 1`.
   - It then appends the total number of screens required (`extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`) to the result.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `x = 0` and `y = 0`, the program correctly outputs `0` screens.
   - If `x = 0` and `y > 0`, the program correctly calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons.
   - If `x > 0` and `y = 0`, the program correctly calculates the number of screens required for 1x1 icons.
   - If both `x` and `y` are non-zero, the program correctly calculates the number of screens required for both types of icons.

4. **Verification with Example:**
   - For the test case `1 1`:
     - `space_x = 1`, `space_y = 4`, `total_space = 5`.
     - `screen_require_for_y = 1` (since `y = 1` is odd).
     - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 4 = 11`.
     - `space_x <= remaining_cells` is true, so it outputs `1`.
   - For the test case `12 4`:
     - `space_x = 12`, `space_y = 16`, `total_space = 28`.
     - `screen_require_for_y = 2` (since `y = 4` is even).
     - `remaining_cells = 15 * 2 - 16 = 14`.
     - `space_x <= remaining_cells` is true, so it outputs `2`.
   - For the test case `0 9`:
     - `space_x = 0`, `space_y = 36`, `total_space = 36`.
     - `screen_require_for_y = 5` (since `y = 9` is odd).
     - `remaining_cells = 15 * 5 - 36 = 39`.
     - `space_x <= remaining_cells` is true, so it outputs `5`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles all the edge cases and the example provided.
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens required is sound and follows the problem constraints.
