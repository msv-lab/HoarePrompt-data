Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, and `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is an even integer, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2) - (y * 4)`. If `y` is an odd integer, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - (y * 4)`. `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`. If `extra_space % 15 == 0`, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`.***
