The only object in the loop head is the variable `n`, and the loop control variable `_` is not referenced outside the loop head. Therefore, the only state that can be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to have executed at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0 (since the loop has already executed once, reducing `n` by 1).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is a list. If `y` is an even integer, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2) - (y * 4)`. If `y` is an odd integer, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - (y * 4)`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.**
