Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; n is an input integer; `result` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    space_x = x * 1
    space_y = y * 4
    total_space = space_y + space_x
    if y % 2 == 0:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2
    else:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
    remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
    if space_x <= remaining_cells:
        result.append(screen_require_for_y)
    else:
        extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
        if extra_space % 15 == 0:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15
        else:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
        result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is a list. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains the value of `screen_require_for_y`. If `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `result` contains the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space` is divisible by 15, or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise. `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is an even integer or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is an odd integer, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list. If `y` is an even integer, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2) - (y * 4)`. If `y` is an odd integer, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - (y * 4)`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` <= `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells` and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
