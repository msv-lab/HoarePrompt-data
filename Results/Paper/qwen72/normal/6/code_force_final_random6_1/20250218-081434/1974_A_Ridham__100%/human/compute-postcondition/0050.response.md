Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`.**

Explanation:
- `extra_space` is calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`.
- `remaining_cells` is already defined as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- `screen_require_for_y` is defined as `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.
- `space_x` is equal to `x`.
- `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.
- `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `result`) remain unchanged.
