Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the minimum number of screens required. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is always `y // 2 + (y % 2)`, which is not always the optimal solution. This approach does not consider the possibility of placing 1x1 icons in the remaining spaces on the screens where 2x2 icons are placed, which can lead to an overestimation of the required screens.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
1. Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).
2. A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
3. We should first place as many 2x2 icons as possible on the screens, and then place the 1x1 icons in the remaining spaces.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total_cells = 15
        screens = 0
        
        # Place 2x2 icons first
        while y > 0:
            if y >= 4:
                # Place 4 2x2 icons on one screen
                y -= 4
                screens += 1
            elif y >= 2:
                # Place 2 2x2 icons on one screen
                y -= 2
                screens += 1
                remaining_cells = total_cells - (2 * 4)
                x -= remaining_cells  # Place 1x1 icons in the remaining cells
            else:
                # Place 1 2x2 icon on one screen
                y -= 1
                screens += 1
                remaining_cells = total_cells - 4
                x -= remaining_cells  # Place 1x1 icons in the remaining cells
        
        # Place remaining 1x1 icons
        if x > 0:
            screens += (x + total_cells - 1) // total_cells  # Ceiling division to account for partial screens
        
        result.append(screens)
    
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that we place the 2x2 icons first and then use the remaining space on each screen to place as many 1x1 icons as possible. Finally, it calculates the number of additional screens needed for any remaining 1x1 icons. This approach should correctly determine the minimum number of screens required for all test cases.
