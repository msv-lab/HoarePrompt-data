Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2) - (y * 4)` if `y` is even or `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - (y * 4)` if `y` is odd, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`.**
