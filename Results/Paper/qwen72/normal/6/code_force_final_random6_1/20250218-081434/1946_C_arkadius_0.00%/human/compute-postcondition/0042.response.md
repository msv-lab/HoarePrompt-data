Output State: **The `tree` remains a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is still an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is still a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `v` is the last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is the last boolean value in the stack, and `stack` is the stack with the tuple `(v, True)` followed by tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v` appended to the stack.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `tree` object, the starting vertex `s`, and the minimum size `x` remain unchanged. The variable `v` is still the last vertex in the stack, and `postorder` is still the last boolean value in the stack. The `stack` now contains the tuple `(v, True)` followed by tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v`, reflecting that all children of `v` have been added to the stack with the boolean value `False`.
