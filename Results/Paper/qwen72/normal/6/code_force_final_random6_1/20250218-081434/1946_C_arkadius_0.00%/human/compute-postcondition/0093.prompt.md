Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `v` is the new last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is the new last boolean value in the stack, and `stack` is the stack with the last tuple removed but still contains at least one tuple. `postorder` is True, and the stack does not contain any children of `v` as the last elements.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `v` is the new last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is True, the stack does not contain any children of `v` as the last elements, the stack still contains at least one tuple, `tree.vertices[v].children` must contain at least one child, and `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is now equal to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].good_components`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is now equal to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tree.vertices[v].good_components` is now equal to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].good_components`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is now equal to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `v` is the new last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is True, the stack does not contain any children of `v` as the last elements, the stack still contains at least one tuple, `tree.vertices[v].children` must contain at least one child, and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tree.vertices[v].good_components` is now equal to its previous value plus 1 if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is now equal to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].good_components`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` remains unchanged if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise, it is now equal to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `v` is the new last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is True, the stack does not contain any children of `v` as the last elements, the stack still contains at least one tuple, `tree.vertices[v].children` must contain at least two children, and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
