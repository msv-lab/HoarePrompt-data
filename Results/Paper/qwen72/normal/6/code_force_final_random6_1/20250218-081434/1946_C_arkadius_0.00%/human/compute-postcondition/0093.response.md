Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components` is equal to its initial value plus the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of `v` that have been processed. Additionally, for each child `u` of `v` that has a `remaining_size` less than `x`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is equal to its initial value plus the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for these children. If any child `u` has a `remaining_size` greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is incremented by 1 for each such child. The stack still contains at least one tuple, `postorder` is True, and `v` is the new last vertex in the stack, with no children of `v` as the last elements in the stack.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop, the `good_components` of the vertex `v` will have been updated to include the `good_components` of all its children, plus one for each child whose `remaining_size` is at least `x`. The `remaining_size` of `v` will have been updated to include the `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. The stack will still contain at least one tuple, `postorder` will remain True, and `v` will be the last vertex in the stack, with no children of `v` as the last elements in the stack.
