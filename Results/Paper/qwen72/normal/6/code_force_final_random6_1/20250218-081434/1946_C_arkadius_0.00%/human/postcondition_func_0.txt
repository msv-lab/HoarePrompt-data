The function `func_1` accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `s` representing the starting vertex, and a non-negative integer `x` representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component. It processes the tree to count the number of good components (subtrees) rooted at each vertex, where a good component is defined as a subtree with a size of at least `x`. After processing, it returns the total number of good components rooted at vertex `s` and the size of the subtree rooted at `s` after removing all the good components.
