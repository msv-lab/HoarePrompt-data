The function `func_5` reads input values for `n` and `k` (integers where 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5) and a series of `n-1` edges represented by pairs of integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n). It constructs a tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, roots the tree at node 0, and prints the number of nodes at depth `k` in the tree. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
