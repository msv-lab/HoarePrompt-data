Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `k` < `n`, `mid` is (`beg` + `end` + 1) // 2, `beg` is now equal to `mid`, `beg` is less than `end`.**

The value of `beg` is updated to be equal to `mid`, which is calculated as (`beg` + `end` + 1) // 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
