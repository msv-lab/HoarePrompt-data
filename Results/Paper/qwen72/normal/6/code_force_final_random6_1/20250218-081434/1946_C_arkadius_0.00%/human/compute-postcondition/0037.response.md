Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `v` is the last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is the last boolean value in the stack, `stack` is the stack with the tuple `(v, True)` and `(u, False)` appended, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child, `u` is the first child of `v`.** 

The tuple `(u, False)` has been appended to the stack, where `u` is the first child of `v`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
