Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `v` is the new last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is the new last boolean value in the stack, `stack` now contains the tuple `(v, True)` as the second-to-last element and all the children of `v` as the last elements in the stack, each with the boolean value `False`. `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least as many children as the number of iterations the loop has executed.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the `tree` remains unchanged. The `s` and `x` variables also remain unchanged. The `stack` now contains the tuple `(v, True)` as the second-to-last element, and the last elements in the stack are all the children of `v`, each paired with the boolean value `False`. The number of children in `tree.vertices[v].children` must be at least as many as the number of times the loop has executed.
