Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component. If `postorder` is `True`, `stack` remains an empty list, `v` is a valid vertex in the tree, `tree.vertices[v].children` has been fully iterated over. `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is now equal to its initial value plus the sum of `good_components` of all its children, plus 1 for each child whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is now equal to its initial value plus the sum of `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. If `postorder` is `False`, `stack` is a list containing the tuple `(v, True)` followed by tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`.***
