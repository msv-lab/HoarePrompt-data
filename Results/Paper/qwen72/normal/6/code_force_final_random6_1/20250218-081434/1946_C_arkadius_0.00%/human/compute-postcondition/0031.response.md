Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `postorder` is `True`, `stack` remains an empty list, `v` is a valid vertex in the tree, `tree.vertices[v].children` has been fully iterated over. `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is now equal to its initial value plus the sum of `good_components` of all its children, plus 1 for each child whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is now equal to its initial value plus the sum of `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing all iterations, the `good_components` of vertex `v` will have been updated to include the `good_components` of all its children and an additional 1 for each child whose `remaining_size` meets or exceeds the threshold `x`. The `remaining_size` of vertex `v` will have been updated to include the `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is below the threshold `x`. All other variables and properties remain unchanged.
