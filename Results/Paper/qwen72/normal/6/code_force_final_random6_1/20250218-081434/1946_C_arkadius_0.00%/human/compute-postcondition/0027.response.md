Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `postorder` is `True`, `stack` remains an empty list, `v` is a valid vertex in the tree, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least three children, `u` is the third child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`.** 

The code updates the `good_components` attribute of the vertex `v` by adding the `good_components` attribute of its third child `u`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
