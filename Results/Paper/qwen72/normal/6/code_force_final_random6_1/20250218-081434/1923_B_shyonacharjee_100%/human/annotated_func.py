#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, and test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: (n, k, a, x). n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and x is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        
        bullets_used = 0
        
        can_survive = True
        
        for pos, health in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` and `x` are lists of integers input by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by the absolute value of the first element in the tuple, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all the tuples in `monsters` that were processed before the loop broke or completed, `can_survive` is False if at any point `total_bullets_needed` (which is `bullets_used + health` for the current tuple) exceeds `distance * k` for any tuple, otherwise `can_survive` is True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a series of test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of four elements: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`. The function determines whether it is possible to survive by using a certain number of bullets to defeat monsters, where `n` is the number of monsters, `k` is the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per unit distance, `a` is a list of the health points of the monsters, and `x` is a list of the positions of the monsters. The function prints 'YES' if it is possible to defeat all the monsters without exceeding the bullet limit for any monster, and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the state where `t` is 0, `n` and `k` are the input integers for the last test case, `a` and `x` are the lists of integers for the last test case, `monsters` is a list of tuples `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by the absolute value of the position, `bullets_used` is the total number of bullets used in the last test case, and `can_survive` is a boolean indicating whether it was possible to survive the last test case.
