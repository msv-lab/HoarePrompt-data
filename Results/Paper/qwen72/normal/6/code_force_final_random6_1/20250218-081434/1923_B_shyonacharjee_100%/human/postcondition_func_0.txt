The function `func_1` reads a series of test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of four elements: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`. The function determines whether it is possible to survive by using a certain number of bullets to defeat monsters, where `n` is the number of monsters, `k` is the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per unit distance, `a` is a list of the health points of the monsters, and `x` is a list of the positions of the monsters. The function prints 'YES' if it is possible to defeat all the monsters without exceeding the bullet limit for any monster, and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the state where `t` is 0, `n` and `k` are the input integers for the last test case, `a` and `x` are the lists of integers for the last test case, `monsters` is a list of tuples `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by the absolute value of the position, `bullets_used` is the total number of bullets used in the last test case, and `can_survive` is a boolean indicating whether it was possible to survive the last test case.
