Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` and `x` are lists of integers input by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples where each tuple is `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by the absolute value of the first element in the tuple, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all tuples in `monsters` that were processed before the loop either completed or broke, `can_survive` is False if at any point the total bullets needed exceeded the product of the distance and `k` for any monster, otherwise `can_survive` is True.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all iterations:
- The variable `bullets_used` will contain the total sum of the health values of all the monsters that were processed before the loop either completed or encountered a condition where the total bullets needed exceeded the product of the distance and `k`.
- The variable `can_survive` will be False if at any point during the loop, the total bullets needed to defeat a monster exceeded the product of the distance to that monster and the rate `k`. If the loop completes without encountering this condition, `can_survive` will remain True.
