It seems there was a misunderstanding in the function definition provided. Based on the problem description, the function should take parameters to handle the input data. Here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def can_survive(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, and test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: (n, k, a, x). n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and x is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
