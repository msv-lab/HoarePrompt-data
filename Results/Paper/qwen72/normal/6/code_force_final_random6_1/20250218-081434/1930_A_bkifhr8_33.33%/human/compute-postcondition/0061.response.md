Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `2n`, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is unchanged, the length of `lst` is 2 or 0, depending on whether `n` is even or odd, respectively.** 

The value of `ans` before the if-else block is appended to the list `ans_f`, and no other variables are affected. The length of `lst` remains 2 or 0, depending on whether `n` is even or odd, respectively.
