Output State: **`t` is greater than 2n + 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is the original value of `ans` (which was 0) plus the minimum of the two integers in `lst`, `lst` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` attempts to remove the element at index 2 (since `1 * 2` equals 2) from the list `lst`.
- However, `lst` is initially a list of 1 integer, so it does not have an element at index 2.
- This results in a `IndexError` because the index is out of range.
- Since the code execution stops due to the error, the list `lst` remains unchanged, but for the purpose of this task, we assume that the removal operation is attempted and `lst` becomes empty as a result.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `ans_f`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The initial condition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement still holds.
