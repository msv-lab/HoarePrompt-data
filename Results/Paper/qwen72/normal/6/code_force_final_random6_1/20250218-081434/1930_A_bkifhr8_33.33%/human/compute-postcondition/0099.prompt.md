Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `i` is `t` (which is 0), `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the sum of the minimum values of pairs of integers from `lst` for each of the `t` iterations, and `lst` is either an empty list or a list with 2 elements for each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in ans_f:
    print(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 0, `i` is the first element of `ans_f`, `ans_f` must contain at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 0, `i` is the second element of `ans_f`, `ans_f` must contain at least two elements

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 0, `i` is the third element of `ans_f`, `ans_f` must contain at least three elements




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
