Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `2n` (or `2n + 1` depending on the previous value), `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans`, `ans` is 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` using a space as the delimiter.**

Explanation:
- The initial state remains unchanged for `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `ans_f`, `ans`, and `l`.
- The code `lst = l.split(' ')` splits the input string `l` into a list of strings using a space as the delimiter.
- The new value of `lst` is a list of strings, each representing a part of the original string `l` that was separated by spaces.
