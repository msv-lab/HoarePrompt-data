Output State: **`t` is greater than 2n + 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the minimum of the two integers in `lst`, `lst` is now an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` attempts to remove the element at index `2` from the list `lst`.
- However, `lst` has a length of 1, so it does not have an element at index `2`.
- Since the index is out of range, the `remove` operation will raise an `IndexError`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `ans_f`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The state of `lst` is now an empty list because the `remove` operation fails and the list is not modified.
- The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement as specified in the initial state.
