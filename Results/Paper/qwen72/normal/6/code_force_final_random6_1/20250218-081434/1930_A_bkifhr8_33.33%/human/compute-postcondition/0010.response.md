Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is `ans` + `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces, and the length of `lst` is not equal to 2. The first element of `lst` has been removed.**

Explanation:
- The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the first element of the list `lst` (since `0 * 2` is 0).
- The length of `lst` is now one less than it was before, but it still does not equal 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
