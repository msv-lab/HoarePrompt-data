Output State: **`t` is greater than 2n + 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is the original value of `ans` (which was 0) plus the minimum of the two integers in `lst`, `lst` is a list of 1 integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
