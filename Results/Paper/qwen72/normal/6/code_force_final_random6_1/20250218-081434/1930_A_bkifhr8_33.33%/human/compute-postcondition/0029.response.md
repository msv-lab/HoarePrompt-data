Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, and `l` is an input string. If `len(lst) != 2`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value of the first two integers in the list `lst`, and `lst` is a list with two elements removed: the first element is now the second element from the initial state, and the third element from the initial state is also removed. If `len(lst) == 2`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value of the first two integers in the list `lst`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
