Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, and the length of `lst` is either 2 or reduced by 1 with the element at index 2 removed. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
