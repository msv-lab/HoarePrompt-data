The code snippet updates the value of `count` by adding the values associated with `mod_x` and `mod_y` in the `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries, respectively. If `mod_x` or `mod_y` are not keys in their respective dictionaries, the `.get()` method returns 0.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **`mod_x` Calculation**: `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x`.
2. **`mod_y` Calculation**: `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`.
3. **`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`**: Both dictionaries contain the key `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` with a value of 2. Since `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` and `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y`, `mod_x` and `mod_y` will match these keys.
4. **`count` Update**: `count` is incremented by the sum of the values associated with `mod_x` and `mod_y` in their respective dictionaries. Since both `mod_x` and `mod_y` match keys in their dictionaries, each will contribute 2 to the sum.

Therefore, the value of `count` is incremented by 4.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 6, `mod_x_map` now contains the key `mod_x_key` with a value of 2, `mod_y_map` now contains the key `mod_y_key` with a value of 2, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y`.**
