The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers. Each `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, each `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and each element in the list of integers is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list `results` containing the final value of `count` for each tuple in `test_cases`. Each `count` is the total sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for all elements in the corresponding list of integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list of `n` integers. It returns a list of integers, where each integer is the sum of the counts of elements in the corresponding list that have a specific remainder when divided by `x` or `y`.**
