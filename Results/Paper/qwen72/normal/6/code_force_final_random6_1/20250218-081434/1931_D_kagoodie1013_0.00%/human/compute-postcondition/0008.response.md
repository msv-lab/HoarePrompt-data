The code snippet updates the `count` variable by adding the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` to it. Since `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are both empty dictionaries, the `get` method will return `0` for any key, including `mod_x` and `mod_y`. Therefore, `count` will be incremented by `0 + 0`, which means `count` remains `0`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`.**
