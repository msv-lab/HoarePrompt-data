Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is the sum of all the values added during the loop iterations, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with keys representing the unique remainders of `-num % x` for all elements in `arr` and values representing the count of each remainder, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with keys representing the unique remainders of `num % y` for all elements in `arr` and values representing the count of each remainder, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.**

In natural language, after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The `test_cases` list and the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` remain unchanged.
- The `arr` list must have at least `n` elements.
- The `num` variable holds the value of the last element in `arr`.
- The `results` list contains the final value of `count`.
- The `count` variable is the sum of all the values added during the loop iterations, which are the counts of previously seen remainders for both `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
- The `mod_x_map` dictionary contains keys representing the unique remainders of `-num % x` for all elements in `arr`, and the values represent the count of each remainder.
- The `mod_y_map` dictionary contains keys representing the unique remainders of `num % y` for all elements in `arr`, and the values represent the count of each remainder.
- The `mod_x` variable is the remainder of `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`.
- The `mod_y` variable is the remainder of `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.
- The `mod_x_key` variable is the remainder of `num % x` for the last element of `arr`.
- The `mod_y_key` variable is the remainder of `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.
