Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x`.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value of `num % x` to the variable `mod_x_key`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mod_x_key` is now the same as `mod_y`, since both are computed as `num % x`. The initial state's conditions for `test_cases`, `arr`, `results`, `count`, `mod_x_map`, and `mod_y_map` remain valid. The values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` are also still valid, as they were not modified by the code snippet.
