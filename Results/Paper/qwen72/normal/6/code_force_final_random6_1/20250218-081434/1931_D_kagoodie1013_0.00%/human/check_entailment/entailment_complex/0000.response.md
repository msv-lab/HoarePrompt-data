### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array for multiple test cases. A beautiful pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is defined by the conditions:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program reads the input, processes each test case, and computes the number of beautiful pairs using the following approach:
- It maintains two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to count the occurrences of remainders when elements of the array are taken modulo \(x\) and \(y\), respectively.
- For each element in the array, it calculates the required remainders and checks if there are any previous elements that satisfy the conditions for forming a beautiful pair.
- It updates the count of beautiful pairs and the dictionaries accordingly.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic used to count the beautiful pairs:
- The program increments the count by the sum of the values in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the current element's remainders. This approach is incorrect because it does not ensure that both conditions are satisfied simultaneously for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\).
- To correctly count the beautiful pairs, we need to check if both conditions are satisfied for each pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (where \(i < j\)) and increment the count only if both conditions hold.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation of the Flaw:
- The current implementation counts pairs where either \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) or \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\), but it does not ensure that both conditions are met simultaneously.
- For example, in the test case where \(x = 5\) and \(y = 2\), the program might incorrectly count pairs that only satisfy one of the conditions, leading to an incorrect result.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (where \(i < j\)) and check both conditions for each pair. If both conditions are satisfied, we increment the count.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (arr[i] + arr[j]) % x == 0 and (arr[i] - arr[j]) % y == 0:
                    count += 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

This approach ensures that both conditions are checked for each pair, and the count is incremented only when both conditions are satisfied. However, this approach has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), which might be too slow for large inputs. A more efficient approach would involve using a different data structure or algorithm to reduce the time complexity.
