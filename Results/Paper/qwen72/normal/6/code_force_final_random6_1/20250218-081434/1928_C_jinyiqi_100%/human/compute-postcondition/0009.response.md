Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 2]` if `x` is divisible by `1` and `2`, otherwise `output1` remains `[1]`. `output2` is a list containing `[x, x // 2]` if `x` is divisible by `1`, otherwise `output2` remains `[x // 2]`. `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` remains the same, as it is not modified by the code.
- The value of `output1` remains the same, as it is not modified by the code.
- The value of `output2` is updated by appending the result of `int(x / i)`, which is `x // 2` since `i` is 2.
- The value of `i` remains 2, as it is not modified by the code.
