### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the pattern alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers from 1 to \( k \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - If \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \), it calls `func_1` with \( n + x - 2 \).
     - If \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \), it calls `func_1` with \( n - x \).
   - The function `func_1` returns all divisors of the given number in descending order.
   - The program then filters the divisors to ensure they are even and greater than or equal to \( x \).
   - It collects all valid \( k \) values in the `output` list, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the list.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in descending order.
   - It does this by iterating from 1 to the square root of \( x \), checking for divisors, and appending both the divisor and its corresponding quotient to the lists `output1` and `output2`.
   - The lists are then combined and returned in descending order.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program is to check if \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even, and if so, find their divisors.
   - The divisors are then filtered to ensure they are even and greater than or equal to \( x \).
   - The valid \( k \) values are collected in the `output` list, and duplicates are removed using `set`.

5. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic for finding divisors and filtering them is correct.
   - The conditions for checking if \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even are appropriate because the settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and \( k \) must be a natural number greater than 1.
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when \( n \) and \( x \) are close to the upper limit of \( 10^9 \).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the conditions and filtering are appropriate for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
