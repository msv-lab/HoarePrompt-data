Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list containing `[1]` if `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), otherwise `output1` remains an empty list. `output2` is a list containing `[x]` if `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), otherwise `output2` remains an empty list. `i` is 1.***
