The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9 and returns a list of all divisors of `x` in descending order. The list includes all integers that divide `x` without leaving a remainder, starting from the largest divisor down to 1. If `x` is a perfect square, the square root of `x` will appear only once in the list.
