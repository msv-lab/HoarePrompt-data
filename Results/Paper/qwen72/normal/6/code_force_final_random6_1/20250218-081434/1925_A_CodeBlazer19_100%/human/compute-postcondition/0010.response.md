Output State: **`t` iterations have completed, `i` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are input integers.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the loop counter `i` will have reached the value `t-1` (since it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration). The variables `n` and `k` will be the input integers provided during the last iteration of the loop. The loop will have printed the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' truncated to the first `k` characters, repeated `n` times, for each of the `t` iterations.
