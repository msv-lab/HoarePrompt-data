Output State: **`tc` is 2 or 3, `N` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0, `t` is the number of unique elements in `a` that appeared exactly once in the list `a` from index 0 to `N-1` up to the point where `t` reached 2 or a non-unique element was found, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int, and `cnt[a[0]]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `0` of the list `a` in the defaultdict `cnt`. Since `i` is initially 0, this operation affects only `cnt[a[0]]`, setting it to 1. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
