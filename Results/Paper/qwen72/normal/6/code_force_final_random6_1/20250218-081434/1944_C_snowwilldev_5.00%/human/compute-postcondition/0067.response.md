Output State: **`tc` is 2 or 3, `N` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `N-1`, `t` is the number of unique elements in `a` that appeared exactly once in the list `a` from index 0 to `N-1` up to the point where `t` reached 2 or a non-unique element was found, and `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int where `cnt[a[i]]` is the count of how many times each integer in `a` appeared in the list `a` from index 0 to `N-1`.**

Explanation:
- `N` is updated to the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer greater than 1.
- The values of `tc`, `a`, `i`, `t`, and `cnt` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
