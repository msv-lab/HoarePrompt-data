Output State: **`tc` is 1 or 2, `N` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `t` is the number of times `cnt[i]` was 1 for `i` from 0 to `N-1`, and `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int where `cnt[a[0]]` is 1 and `cnt[a[1]]` is 1 or 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1.
- If `a[1]` was already in `cnt` and had a value of 1, it is now 2.
- If `a[1]` was not in `cnt` before, it is now 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
