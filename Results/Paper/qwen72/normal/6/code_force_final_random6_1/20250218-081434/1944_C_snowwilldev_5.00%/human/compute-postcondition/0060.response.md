Output State: **`tc` is 1 or 2, `N` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int where `cnt[a[i]]` is the count of how many times each integer in `a` appeared in the list `a` from index 0 to `N-1`. If `t` was less than 2 and `cnt[i]` is not 0, `t` is now `t + 1` and `cnt[a[i]]` is 1. If `t` was greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, `t` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
