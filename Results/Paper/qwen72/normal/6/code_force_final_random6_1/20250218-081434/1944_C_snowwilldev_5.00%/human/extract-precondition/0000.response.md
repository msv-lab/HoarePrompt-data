Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array a, and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array a. The function should also handle an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, and it is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
