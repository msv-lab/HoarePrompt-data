Postcondition: ***`tc` is 0, `N` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `i` is 1. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `t` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[i]` is 1, and the program continues.***
