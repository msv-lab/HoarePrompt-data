Output State: **`tc` is 1 or 2, `N` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `N-1`, `t` is the number of unique elements in `a` that appeared exactly once in the list `a` from index 0 to `N-1` up to the point where `t` reached 2 or a non-unique element was found, and `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int where `cnt[a[i]]` is the count of how many times each integer in `a` appeared in the list `a` from index 0 to `N-1`. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or a non-unique element was found, the loop breaks and the final value of `i` is the index where the loop broke. Otherwise, the loop completes and `i` is `N-1`.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `tc` remains either 1 or 2, `N` is still the input integer greater than 1, and `a` is the same list of integers provided by the user. The variable `i` will be the index where the loop broke if `t` reached 2 or a non-unique element was found, otherwise, `i` will be `N-1` (indicating the loop completed all iterations). The variable `t` will be the number of unique elements in `a` that appeared exactly once, up to the point where the loop broke or completed. The `cnt` dictionary will contain the counts of how many times each integer in `a` appeared in the list from index 0 to `N-1`.
