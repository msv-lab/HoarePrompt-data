The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` 2, and `N` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2**
