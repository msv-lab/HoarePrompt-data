#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array a, and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array a. The function should also handle an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, and it is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
        t = 0
        
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
        
    #State: `tc` is `int(input()) - 1`, `N` is the last input integer greater than 0, `a` is the last list of integers provided by the user, `i` is the index at which the loop breaks or `N-1` if it completes all iterations, `t` is the number of times an element with a count of 1 has been encountered before the loop breaks or completes all iterations, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int, and `cnt[a[j]]` is the count of how many times the element `a[j]` appears in the list `a` for each `j` from 0 to `N-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` handles multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of size `n`. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each element in `a` and prints the first index `i` where the count of `i` is 1 or where the count of `i` is 0. If no such index is found, it prints the last index `N-1`. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.
