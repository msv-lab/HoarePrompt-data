Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`, `ca[a[r]]` is incremented by 1, `sm` and `ans` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ca[a[r]]` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `cb`, `sm`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The condition `if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]` and the subsequent logic for `sm` and `ans` are not affected by this update.
