Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`. `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`. `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of the common elements between the sorted sublist `a[:m]` and the sorted list `b`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
        sm += 1
    ca[a[r]] += 1
    if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
        sm -= 1
    ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`, `ca[a[r]]` is incremented by 1, `ca[a[r - m]]` is decremented by 1, and `ans` remains unchanged if `sm` is less than `k`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`, `ca[a[r - m]]` is decremented by 1, `ca[a[r]]` is incremented by 1, `r` is `r + 1` and must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again. If `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, `sm` is `sm - 1`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`, `r` is `r + 1` and must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again, `ca[a[r - m]]` is decremented by 1. If `ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]` was true before the execution, `sm` is `sm - 1`. If `ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]` was true before the execution, it may no longer be true after the execution. If `sm >= k`, `ans` is `ans + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
