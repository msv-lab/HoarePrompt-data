Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It processes these inputs to count how many times a sliding window of size `m` in the list `a` contains at least `k` elements that are also present in the list `b`. The function returns this count as an integer. The input constraints ensure that `t` is an integer within a specified range, and `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with `1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5`. The lists `a` and `b` contain integers within the range `1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` holds the number of valid sliding windows in `a` that meet the condition. **
