Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical error in the way it updates the count of matches (`sm`) as it slides the window over the array `a`. Specifically, the conditions for incrementing and decrementing `sm` are not correctly implemented. The logic should be adjusted to accurately reflect the addition and removal of elements from the current window and how these changes affect the number of matches with elements in `b`.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(b)
    ca = Counter(a[:m])
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    for r in range(m, n):
        # Add the new element to the window
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        if a[r] in cb and ca[a[r]] <= cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        
        # Remove the old element from the window
        if a[r - m] in cb and ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    return ans

# Example usage
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))
```

In this corrected version:
- When adding a new element to the window (`a[r]`), we check if this element is in `b` and if its count in `ca` is less than or equal to its count in `cb`. If so, we increment `sm`.
- When removing an old element from the window (`a[r - m]`), we check if this element is in `b` and if its count in `ca` is less than or equal to its count in `cb`. If so, we decrement `sm`.

This ensures that `sm` correctly reflects the number of matching elements between the current window in `a` and the elements in `b`.
