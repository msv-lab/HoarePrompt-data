### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes a `Counter` object `cb` for the sorted list `b` and a `Counter` object `ca` for the sorted sublist `a[:m]`.
   - It then calculates the initial sum `sm` of the minimum frequencies of the common elements between `a[:m]` and `b` using `(ca & cb).values()`.
   - If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans` by 1.

2. **Sliding Window:**
   - The function uses a sliding window approach to iterate over the list `a` from index `m` to `n-1`.
   - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window:
     - It checks if the frequency of `a[r]` in `ca` is less than its frequency in `cb`. If so, it increments `sm` by 1.
     - It increments the frequency of `a[r]` in `ca`.
   - For each element `a[r-m]` removed from the window:
     - It checks if the frequency of `a[r-m]` in `ca` is less than or equal to its frequency in `cb`. If so, it decrements `sm` by 1.
     - It decrements the frequency of `a[r-m]` in `ca`.
   - After updating `sm`, it checks if `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`. If so, it increments `ans` by 1.

3. **Output:**
   - The function returns the count `ans` of subsegments that are good.

### Analysis:
- **Initial Check:**
  - The initial check correctly counts the number of common elements in the first subsegment of length `m` and updates `ans` if the count is at least `k`.

- **Sliding Window Logic:**
  - The sliding window logic is designed to efficiently update the count of common elements as the window moves one position to the right.
  - The conditions for incrementing and decrementing `sm` are correct:
    - Increment `sm` if the new element `a[r]` is not already in the required frequency in `ca`.
    - Decrement `sm` if the element `a[r-m]` being removed was in the required frequency in `ca`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles edge cases where `m` is equal to `n` or `k` is equal to `m` correctly.
  - The function also handles cases where the elements in `a` and `b` are not unique.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subsegments in the array `a` based on the given constraints and problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
