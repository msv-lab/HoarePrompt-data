Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively`, `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + min(len(sng), k - min(k, 2 * len(rdb)))`, `sng` is a list that must have at least `min(len(sng), k - min(k, 2 * len(rdb)))` elements, and `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was printed. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop breaks.**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `i` remains `n - 1`.
- The list `rdb` remains unchanged and still contains all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively.
- The value of `sz` is increased by the number of elements printed from `sng`, which is the minimum of the length of `sng` and the difference between `k` and the initial value of `sz`.
- The list `sng` must have at least as many elements as were printed.
- The variable `elem` holds the last element from `sng` that was printed before the loop either completed or broke because `sz` reached or exceeded `k`.
