Output State: **`a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `T` must be greater than 0, `_` is not relevant for the loop to execute, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `lft` is the first n elements of `lst`, `rgt` is the last n elements of `lst`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `rgt = lst[n:]` assigns the last n elements of the list `lst` to the variable `rgt`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
