Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + 2`, `sng` is a list that must have at least three elements, and `elem` is the third element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
