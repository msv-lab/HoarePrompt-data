Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `sz` is `sz + 1`: This indicates that `sz` is incremented by 1.
2. `elem` is the second element in `sng`: This means `elem` is set to the value of the second element in the list `sng`.
3. `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks: This implies that the list `rdb` has enough elements to ensure that the loop continues until `sz` is no longer less than `k`.
4. `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0: This means that `k` is greater than or equal to `sz`.
5. `sng` must have at least 2 elements: This ensures that `sng` has at least two elements, allowing the second element to be accessed.
6. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited: This means that the loop or if statement will terminate when `sz` reaches or exceeds `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`.

### Output:
Since `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`, the output will be the value of the second element in `sng` followed by a space.

Output: **[second element of sng] **

To make it more precise:
Output: **[elem] (where elem is the second element of the list sng)**
