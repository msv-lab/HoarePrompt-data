The only objects in the loop head are the variables `elem` and the list `sng`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in `sng` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `elem` is the first element in `sng`, and `sng` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least two elements, and `elem` will be the second element in `sng`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + 1`, `sng` is a list that must have at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `sng`**
