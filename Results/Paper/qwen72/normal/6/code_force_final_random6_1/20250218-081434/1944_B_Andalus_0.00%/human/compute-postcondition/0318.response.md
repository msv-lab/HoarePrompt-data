To determine what will be printed by the `print()` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`i`**: The loop has finished executing, so `i` is `n - 1`.
2. **`n`**: This is an input integer that represents the number of elements in the `lft` list.
3. **`k`**: This is another input integer.
4. **`ldb`**: A list containing all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element.
5. **`sng`**: A list containing all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next element (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`).
6. **`rdb`**: A list containing all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element.
7. **`lst`**: A list of integers read from input.
8. **`lft`**: The first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
9. **`rgt`**: The elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.
10. **`elem`**: The last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished.
11. **`sz`**: The minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)` plus the number of elements processed from `sng`.

Given the `print()` statement is empty, it will not print any specific values or strings. The `print()` function without any arguments will simply print a newline character.

Output: **(an empty line)**
