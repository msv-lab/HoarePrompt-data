The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `sng`. If `sng` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in `sng`, and `sz` is `sz + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, and `elem` will be the third element in `sng`.

However, the condition `sz < k` must also be satisfied for the loop to continue. Given that `sz` is `sz + 2` at the end of the previous iteration and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `sz` must still be less than `k` for the loop to execute again. This means `k - (sz + 2)` must be greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`sz` is `sz + 2`, `elem` is the third element in `sng`, `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks, `k - (sz + 2)` is greater than or equal to 0, and `sng` must have at least 3 elements.**
