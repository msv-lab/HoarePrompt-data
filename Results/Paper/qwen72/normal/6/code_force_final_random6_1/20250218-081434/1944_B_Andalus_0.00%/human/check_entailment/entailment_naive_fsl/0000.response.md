Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the elements in the left and right halves of the array are not in the same order. The program assumes that the elements in the left and right halves will be sorted and that pairs of identical elements will be adjacent. However, this is not guaranteed by the problem description, and the program will fail to correctly identify the subsets `l` and `r` in such cases.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 2
1 3 2 4 1 3 2 4
```
In this case, the left half is `[1, 3, 2, 4]` and the right half is `[1, 3, 2, 4]`. The program will sort both halves, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 4]` for both `lft` and `rft`. The program will then try to find pairs of identical elements, but since the elements are not adjacent after sorting, the program will not correctly identify the pairs and will fail to produce the correct output.

The correct output for this case should be:
```
1 3 2 4
1 3 2 4
```
However, the program will not produce this output because it relies on the elements being adjacent after sorting, which is not always the case.
