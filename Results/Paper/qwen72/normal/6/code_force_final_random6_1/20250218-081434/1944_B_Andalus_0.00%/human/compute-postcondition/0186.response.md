To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to understand the context and the values of the variables and objects involved based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`i` is `n - 1`**: This indicates that `i` is the last index of the list `lft` if `n` is the length of `lft`.
2. **`n` is unchanged**: The length of `lft` remains the same.
3. **`ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element**: This means `ldb` is a list of elements from `lft` where each element is the same as the one before it.
4. **`sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element) and must have at least 1 element**: This means `sng` is a list of elements from `lft` that are unique in their position (neither equal to the previous nor the next element).
5. **`k` is unchanged**: The value of `k` remains the same.
6. **`lst` is unchanged**: The list `lst` remains the same.
7. **`lft` is unchanged**: The list `lft` remains the same.
8. **`rgt` is unchanged**: The list `rgt` remains the same.
9. **`sz` is the smallest even number that is greater than or equal to `k` or the total number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller**: This means `sz` is either the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` or `2 * len(ldb)`, whichever is smaller.
10. **`_` is `T`**: This variable `_` is set to `T`, but it is not used in the print statement.
11. **`rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`**: This means `rdb` is a list of elements from `rgt` where each element is the same as the one before it, starting from the second element.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

To determine what `elem` is, we need to understand the context in which this statement is executed. The statement is printing an element `elem` with a space at the end, which suggests that `elem` is part of a loop or a sequence of elements being printed.

### Possible Contexts:
1. **Loop over `lft`**: If the print statement is inside a loop that iterates over `lft`, then `elem` will be each element of `lft` printed with a space.
2. **Loop over `sng`**: If the print statement is inside a loop that iterates over `sng`, then `elem` will be each element of `sng` printed with a space.
3. **Loop over `ldb`**: If the print statement is inside a loop that iterates over `ldb`, then `elem` will be each element of `ldb` printed with a space.
4. **Loop over `rdb`**: If the print statement is inside a loop that iterates over `rdb`, then `elem` will be each element of `rdb` printed with a space.

### Determining the Output:
Since the exact context (which list `elem` is part of) is not provided, we need to consider the most likely scenarios based on the initial state.

1. **If `elem` is from `lft`**:
   - Output: **elements of `lft` separated by spaces**

2. **If `elem` is from `sng`**:
   - Output: **elements of `sng` separated by spaces**

3. **If `elem` is from `ldb`**:
   - Output: **elements of `ldb` separated by spaces**

4. **If `elem` is from `rdb`**:
   - Output: **elements of `rdb` separated by spaces**

### Conclusion:
Without more context, the most precise description of the output is based on the list `elem` is part of. Since the initial state does not specify which list `elem` is from, we can only provide a general description.

Output: **elements of [list] separated by spaces (where [list] is the list from which `elem` is taken, which could be `lft`, `sng`, `ldb`, or `rdb`)**
