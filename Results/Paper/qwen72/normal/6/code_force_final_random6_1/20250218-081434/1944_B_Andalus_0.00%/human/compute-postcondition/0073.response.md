Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus 2, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, separated by spaces, `sng` must be a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sz` is incremented by 1, so `sz` is now the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
