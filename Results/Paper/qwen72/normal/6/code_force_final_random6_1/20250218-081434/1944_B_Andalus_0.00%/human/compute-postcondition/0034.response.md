The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented from 1 to 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

The state of `rdb` and `rgt` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `rgt[1]` is equal to `rgt[0]`, `rdb` is a list that now contains the value of `rgt[1]`.**
