Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + min(len(sng), k - min(k, 2 * len(rdb)))`, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was printed (which is now undefined because `sng` is empty), `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `T` for the loop to execute again, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is the elements from index `n` to the end of `lst`, `ldb` is an empty list.**
