To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `rdb`.

### Analysis:
1. **`elem`**: This variable will be assigned the elements of `rdb` during the loop iterations.
2. **`rdb`**: This is the list that the loop will iterate over. For the loop to execute, `rdb` must contain at least one element.

### Given State:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is unchanged
- `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element
- `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element)
- `k` is unchanged
- `lst` is unchanged
- `lft` is unchanged
- `rgt` is unchanged
- `sz` is 0
- `_` is `T`
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`
- `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished

### Adjustments:
- **`rdb`**: For the loop to execute, `rdb` must contain at least one element. If `rdb` is empty, the loop will not execute.
- **`elem`**: This variable will be assigned the elements of `rdb` during the loop iterations, and it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

### Conclusion:
The state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `rdb` is not empty. The other variables and lists (`i`, `n`, `ldb`, `sng`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `sz`, `_`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element), `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is 0, `_` is `T`, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished**
