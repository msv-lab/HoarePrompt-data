Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + min(len(sng), k - min(k, 2 * len(rdb)))`, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is undefined, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `T` for the loop to execute again, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the elements from index `n` to the end of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is an empty list.**

The code snippet `rgt.sort()` sorts the list `rgt` in ascending order. All other variables and their values remain unchanged. The new state of `rgt` is now sorted, while the initial conditions for the other variables are still valid.
