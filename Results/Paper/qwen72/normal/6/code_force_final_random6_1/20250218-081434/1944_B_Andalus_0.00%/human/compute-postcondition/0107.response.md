Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively.
   - `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb))`.
   - `sng` is a list that must have at least one element.
   - `elem` is the first element in `sng`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem`.
   - `elem` is defined as the first element in the list `sng`.
   - Since `sng` is guaranteed to have at least one element, `elem` will always have a value.
   - The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the value of `elem` followed by a space.

Given that `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`, and we don't have the explicit value of `sng` or `elem`, we can only describe it in terms of the list `sng`.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the first element in the list sng)**
