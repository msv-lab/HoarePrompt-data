Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively and must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`. If `k - sz >= 2`, `sz` is incremented by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, `sz` is reset to 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block. If `k - sz < 2`, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block without modifying `sz`.***
