Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element), `n` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is unchanged, `elem` is undefined, `_` is `T`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 1`, which is the last index that the loop iterates over.
- **`ldb`**: This list will contain all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element. For example, if `lft` is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, `ldb` will be `[1, 2]` because `lft[1] == lft[0]` and `lft[3] == lft[2]`.
- **`sng`**: This list will contain all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element). For example, if `lft` is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, `sng` will be `[3]` because `lft[4]` is not equal to `lft[3]` and it is the last element.
- **`n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `sz`, `elem`, `_`**: These variables remain unchanged from their initial state. `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is the original list of integers, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the elements from index `n` to the end of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `sz` is calculated based on the initial conditions, `elem` is undefined, and `_` is the loop counter that has reached `T` (the total number of iterations).
