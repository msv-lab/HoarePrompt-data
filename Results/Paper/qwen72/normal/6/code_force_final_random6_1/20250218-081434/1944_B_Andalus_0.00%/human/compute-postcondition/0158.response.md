Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element), `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is unchanged, `elem` is undefined, `_` is `T`. If the fourth element of `rgt` is equal to the third element of `rgt`, `rdb` now contains the fourth element of `rgt`. Otherwise, `rdb` remains unchanged.***
