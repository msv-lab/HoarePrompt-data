The code snippet `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the value of `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Given that `i` is 2, the value `rgt[2]` is appended to `rdb`. The initial condition states that if `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[1]`, `rdb` has `rgt[2]` appended to it. Since the code is appending `rgt[2]` regardless of the condition, `rdb` will now include `rgt[2]` as its new last element. The other conditions (`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `rdb` has `rgt[2]` appended to it.**
