Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `sz` is 0, `ldb` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`, and the current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `i`, `rdb`, `sz`, `ldb`, and `elem` remain unchanged. The condition that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` is still valid. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside.
