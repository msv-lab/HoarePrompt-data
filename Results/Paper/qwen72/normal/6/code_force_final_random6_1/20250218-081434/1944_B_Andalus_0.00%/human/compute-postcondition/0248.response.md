The code snippet `rgt.sort()` sorts the list `rgt` in ascending order. The other variables and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `sz` is the minimum of the new `k` and the number of elements in `rdb` times 2 plus the number of elements printed from `sng`, `_` is `T + 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, `lst` is a list of integers read from input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.**
