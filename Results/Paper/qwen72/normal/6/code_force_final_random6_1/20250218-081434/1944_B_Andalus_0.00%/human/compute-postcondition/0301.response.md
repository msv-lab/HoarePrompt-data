To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects directly involved in the loop head, which in this case is the list `sng` and the variable `elem`.

1. **`sng` must be a non-empty list**: For the loop to execute at least once, `sng` must contain at least one element. If `sng` is empty, the loop will not execute.
2. **`elem` is the first element in `sng`**: Before the loop starts, `elem` should be set to the first element of `sng` to ensure the loop can begin its first iteration.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `sng` is not empty and that `elem` is set to the first element of `sng`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next element (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`), `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `lst` is a list of integers read from input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `elem` is the first element in `sng`, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)`, and `sng` must have at least 1 element**.
