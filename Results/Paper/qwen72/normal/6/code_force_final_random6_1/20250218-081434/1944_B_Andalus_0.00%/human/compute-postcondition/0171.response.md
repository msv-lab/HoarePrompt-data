Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element and must have at least two elements, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element), `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is 2 if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `sz` remains 0, `elem` is the second element in `ldb`, `_` is `T`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
