Output State: **`sz` is `sz + 3`, `elem` is the third element in `sng`, `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks, `k - (sz + 3)` is greater than or equal to 0, and `sng` must have at least 3 elements. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sz` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `sz + 1` from its initial value of `sz + 2`.
- The other conditions and variables (`elem`, `rdb`, `k`, and `sng`) remain unchanged.
- The updated condition for the loop or if statement is now `sz + 3 < k`, which simplifies to `k - (sz + 3) >= 0`.
- The precondition that `sng` must have at least 3 elements and `rdb` must have enough elements to satisfy the loop condition remains valid.
