The only objects in the loop head are the variables `elem` and the list `sng`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If `sng` has at least two elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` has at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element in `sng`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least three elements, and `elem` will be the third element in `sng`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + 2`, `sng` is a list that must have at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `sng`**
