Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `ldb` must have at least one element, and `elem` is the first element in `ldb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is updated to 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` after this update, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0.***
