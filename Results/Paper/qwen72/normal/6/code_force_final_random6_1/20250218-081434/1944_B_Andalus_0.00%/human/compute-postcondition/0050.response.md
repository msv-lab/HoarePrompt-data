The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `ldb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `ldb`. If `ldb` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `ldb` must have at least one element, and `elem` is the first element in `ldb`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ldb` must have at least two elements, and `elem` will be the second element in `ldb`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `ldb` must have at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element in `ldb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is updated to 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` after this update, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0.**
