Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `n` is unchanged
   - `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element and must have at least one element
   - `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element)
   - `k` is unchanged
   - `lst` is unchanged
   - `lft` is unchanged
   - `rgt` is unchanged
   - `sz` is 0
   - `elem` is the first element in `ldb`
   - `_` is `T`
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`
   - The current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `elem` is described as the first element in the list `ldb`.
   - `ldb` is a list that contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, and it is guaranteed to have at least one element.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `elem` is the first element in `ldb`, and `ldb` contains elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `elem` will be printed twice.
   - The exact value of `elem` is not provided, but it is known to be the first element in `ldb`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the first element in the list `ldb`)**
