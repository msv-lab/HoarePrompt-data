Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `rdb` is a list with at least two elements.
   - `elem` is the second element in `rdb`.
   - `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The print statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `elem` is the second element in the list `rdb`.

Since the exact values of `rdb`, `k`, and `sz` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the second element in the list `rdb`)**
