Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is unchanged
- `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element
- `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element) and must have at least 1 element
- `k` is unchanged
- `lst` is unchanged
- `lft` is unchanged
- `rgt` is unchanged
- `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `rdb` times 2
- `_` is `T`
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`
- `elem` is the first element in `sng`

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`elem`**: This variable is defined as the first element in the list `sng`. According to the initial state, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element) and must have at least 1 element.
   - Therefore, `elem` is the first element in `sng`.

2. **`print(elem, end=' ')`**: This statement prints the value of `elem` followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).

### Conclusion:
The code will print the first element in the list `sng` followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the first element in the list `sng`)**
