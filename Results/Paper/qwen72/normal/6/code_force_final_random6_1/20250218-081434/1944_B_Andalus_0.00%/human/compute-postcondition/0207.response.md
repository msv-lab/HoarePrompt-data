Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element), `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is 2, `_` is `T`, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, and the difference between `k` and `sz` is at least 0.**

Explanation:
- `sz` is incremented by 2, so `sz` is now 2.
- The difference between `k` and `sz` is now at least 0 (since `sz` was 0 and is now 2, and the difference between `k` and `sz` was at least 2 initially).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
