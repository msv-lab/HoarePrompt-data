Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is not relevant for the loop to execute, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `lft` is the first n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the last n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`.**
