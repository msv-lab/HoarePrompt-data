### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and the list `lst` of length `2n`.

2. **Splitting the List**:
   - The list `lst` is split into two halves: `lft` (first half) and `rgt` (second half).

3. **Sorting**:
   - Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted. This is a good approach because it helps in identifying pairs of duplicate elements easily.

4. **Identifying Duplicates and Singles**:
   - The function iterates through `lft` to identify pairs of duplicate elements and single elements.
     - If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, it is a duplicate and is added to `ldb` (left duplicates).
     - If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `lft[i + 1]`, it is a single element and is added to `sng` (single elements).
   - Similarly, the function iterates through `rgt` to identify pairs of duplicate elements and adds them to `rdb` (right duplicates).

5. **Constructing the Output Arrays**:
   - The function constructs the output arrays `l` and `r` by printing elements from `ldb` and `sng`:
     - For `l`, it prints pairs of duplicate elements from `ldb` until it has printed `2k` elements.
     - If it still needs more elements, it prints single elements from `sng`.
     - The same process is repeated for `r` using `rdb`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function ensures that it does not print more than `2k` elements by using the `sz` variable to keep track of the number of elements printed.
   - The function handles the case where `k` is 1 by printing single elements if necessary.

7. **XOR Property**:
   - The XOR of a number with itself is 0, so printing pairs of duplicate elements ensures that the XOR of these pairs is 0.
   - The XOR of a single element is the element itself, so if `k` is 1 and there are no pairs, the function prints a single element from `sng`.

8. **Guaranteed Solution**:
   - The problem guarantees that a solution always exists, and the function's approach of using pairs of duplicates and single elements ensures that it will always find a valid solution.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies pairs of duplicate elements and single elements from the sorted halves of the input list. It then constructs the output arrays `l` and `r` by printing the required number of elements to ensure the XOR condition is met. The program handles edge cases and guarantees a solution for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
