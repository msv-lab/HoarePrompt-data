Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, the list `ldb` has been appended with the element at index 1 of `lft`. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` is a list that includes the value of `lft[i]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains unchanged.***
