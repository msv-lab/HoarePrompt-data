Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string with at least three elements, and `c` is the third element of `s`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [3, 0], and `ans` is `zeroes - 1` (from the if part) or `zeroes - 2 + zeroes - 3` (from the else part). If `c` is not 0, `cnt` is [0, 3], and `ans` is `2 * (zeroes - 1) - 1` (from the if part) or `2 * (zeroes - 1) - 2 + zeroes` (from the else part).***
