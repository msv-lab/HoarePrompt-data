Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least 3 elements, `c` is the third element in `s`, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s` which is at least 1. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [1, 2] or [0, 3] or [2, 1], and `ans` is 1 if the first element was 0, or `zeroes - cnt[0] + 1` if the first element was 1. If `c` is 1, `cnt` is updated to [1, 2] if the first element was 0 and `c` is 1, or [2, 0] if the first element was 0 and `c` is 0, or [0, 3] if the first element was 1 and `c` is 1, or [2, 1] if the first element was 1 and `c` is 0, and `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]` if the first element was 0 or `2 * (zeroes - cnt[0])` if the first element was 1.**
