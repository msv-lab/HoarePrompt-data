The only objects in the loop head are the list `s` and the variable `c`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `s`. If `s` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements, and `c` is the second element of `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least three elements, and `c` will be the third element of `s`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string with at least three elements, `c` is the third element of `s`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [2, 0], and `ans` is `zeroes - 2`. Otherwise, `cnt` is [0, 2], and `ans` is `2 * (zeroes - 1) - 2`.**
