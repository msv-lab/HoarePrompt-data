Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least 1 element, `c` is the first element in `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0] with `cnt[c]` incremented by 1, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`, and `c` is not 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of `zeroes - cnt[0]` to its current value.
- Since `ans` was initially 0, the new value of `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.
- The value of `cnt[0]` is 0 because `c` is not 0, and `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, which means `cnt[1]` is 1 if `c` is 1.
- The values of `n`, `s`, `c`, `cnt`, and `zeroes` remain unchanged.
