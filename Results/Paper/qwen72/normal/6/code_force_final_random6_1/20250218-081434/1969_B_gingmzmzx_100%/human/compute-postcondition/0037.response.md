Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least one integer, `c` is the first integer in `s`, `cnt` is [1, 0] if `c` is 0, or [0, 1] if `c` is 1, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is `zeroes - 1`.***
