Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least one integer, `c` is the first integer in `s`, `cnt` is [0, 1] if `c` is 1, `ans` is `zeroes - 1`, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`, and `c` is not 0.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`.
- Since `c` is not 0, `cnt` is [0, 1].
- Therefore, `ans` becomes `zeroes - 1`.
- The values of `n`, `s`, `c`, `cnt`, and `zeroes` remain unchanged.
