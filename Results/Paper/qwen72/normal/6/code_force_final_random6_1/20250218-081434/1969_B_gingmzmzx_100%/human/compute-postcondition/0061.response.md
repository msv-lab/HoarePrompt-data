Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least 1 element, `c` is the first element in `s`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [1, 0] with `cnt[c]` incremented by 1, `ans` is 0, and `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s` which is at least 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is [0, 1] with `cnt[c]` incremented by 1, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`, and `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`.**
