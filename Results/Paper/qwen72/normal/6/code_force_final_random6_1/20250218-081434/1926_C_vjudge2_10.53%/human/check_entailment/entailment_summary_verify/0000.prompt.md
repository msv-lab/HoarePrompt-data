You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    values = [0 for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, and then reads `t` integers, each representing the largest number for each test case. It calculates the sum of a sequence of values for each number up to the largest number in the test cases, where each value is determined by the sum of the value of the last digit and the value of the remaining digits of the number. The function prints the cumulative sum of these values for each test case number. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the input number `n` is not the same as the maximum number in the list of test cases. The `for` loop that calculates the `values` and `sum_values` arrays runs up to `n + 1`, but `n` should be the maximum number in the `numbers` list. This can lead to incorrect results if `n` is smaller than the maximum number in the list of test cases. For example, if the input is:
```
2
12
5
```
The program will calculate the `values` and `sum_values` arrays up to 12, but for the second test case (n=5), it will use the precomputed values up to 12, which is incorrect. The correct approach should be to compute the `values` and `sum_values` arrays up to the maximum number in the `numbers` list, and then use these arrays to find the results for each test case.
