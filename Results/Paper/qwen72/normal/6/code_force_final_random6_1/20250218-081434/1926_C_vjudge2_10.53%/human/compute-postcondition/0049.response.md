Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 45, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `values[10]` is 0, `values[11]` is 0, `values[12]` is 1, `values[13]` is 1, `values[14]` is 2, `values[15]` is 2, `values[16]` is 3, `values[17]` is 3, `values[18]` is 4, `values[19]` is 4, `values[20]` is 5, `values[21]` is 5, `values[22]` is 6, `values[23]` is 6, `values[24]` is 7, `values[25]` is 7, `values[26]` is 8, `values[27]` is 8, `values[28]` is 9, `values[29]` is 9, `sum_values[10]` is 0, `sum_values[11]` is 0, `sum_values[12]` is 1, `sum_values[13]` is 2, `sum_values[14]` is 4, `sum_values[15]` is 6, `sum_values[16]` is 9, `sum_values[17]` is 12, `sum_values[18]` is 16, `sum_values[19]` is 20, `sum_values[20]` is 25, `sum_values[21]` is 30, `sum_values[22]` is 36, `sum_values[23]` is 42, `sum_values[24]` is 49, `sum_values[25]` is 56, `sum_values[26]` is 64, `sum_values[27]` is 72, `sum_values[28]` is 81, `sum_values[29]` is 90, and so on up to `sum_values[n]` is the sum of all `values` from 0 to `n`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n + 1`, indicating that the loop has completed. The `values` list will have been updated such that for each index `i` from 10 to `n`, `values[i]` is the sum of `values` at the indices corresponding to the last digit and the remainder of `i`. The `sum_values` list will have been updated to contain the cumulative sum of the `values` list up to each index `i`. The other variables (`t`, `numbers`, `total`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
