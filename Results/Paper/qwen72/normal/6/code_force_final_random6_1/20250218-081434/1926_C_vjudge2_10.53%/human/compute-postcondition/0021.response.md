Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 1, `i` is 1, `values[1]` is 1, `sum_values[0]` is 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `i`. Since `i` is 1, `total` becomes 1.
- The values of `t`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`, and `values[1]` remain unchanged.
- The value of `sum_values[0]` remains 0.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
