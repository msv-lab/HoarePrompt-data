Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` must still be greater than or equal to 0. The list `numbers` will contain `t` input integers, where each integer `n` is within the range of 1 to 200,000 (inclusive). The variable `n` will be the last input integer that was read and appended to the list `numbers`.
