### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the `t` integers representing the values of `n` for each test case. This is consistent with the problem description and the annotated code.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The lists `values` and `sum_values` are initialized to store the sum of digits for each number and the cumulative sum of these values, respectively. The size of these lists is `max(numbers) + 1`, which is appropriate to handle the largest `n` in the test cases.
   - The first 10 values in `values` are correctly set to their respective digits (0 to 9), and the cumulative sum `sum_values` is updated accordingly for the first 10 numbers.

3. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - The function correctly calculates the sum of digits for numbers from 10 to `n` using the previously computed values.
   - The sum of digits for a number `i` is calculated by converting `i` to a string, extracting the last digit, and the remainder of the number (all digits except the last one).
   - The sum of digits for `i` is then computed as the sum of the last digit and the sum of digits of the remainder.
   - The cumulative sum `sum_values` is correctly updated for each `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - For each `n` in the `numbers` list, the function prints the cumulative sum of the sum of digits up to `n`. This is consistent with the problem description and the annotated code.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The function uses dynamic programming to avoid recalculating the sum of digits for each number, which is efficient.
   - However, the function calculates the sum of digits for all numbers up to the maximum `n` in the test cases, which might be unnecessary if the test cases have different values of `n`. This could lead to inefficiency in cases where the test cases have a large range of `n` values.

6. **Time Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of the function is \(O(n)\) for the dynamic programming part, where `n` is the maximum number in the test cases.
   - Given the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test and the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), the function should be able to handle the input within the time limit. However, the inefficiency mentioned in the previous point could be a concern for large inputs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is logically correct and should produce the correct output for the given problem. However, it can be optimized to avoid unnecessary calculations for each test case. Despite this, the current implementation is efficient enough to meet the time constraints for the given problem.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
