Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 3, `i` is 2, `values[1]` is 1, `sum_values[1]` is 1, `values[2]` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `i`.
- The initial value of `total` is 1, and the initial value of `i` is 2, so `total` becomes 3.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
