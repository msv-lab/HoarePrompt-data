Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the variable `total`, which is now explicitly set to 0.
