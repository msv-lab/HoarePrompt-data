The function `func_1` should accept two parameters: `t` and `n`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `n` is a list of integers, where each element represents the largest number for each test case, with the constraint that 1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, if the largest number `n[i]` is even, the function returns `True` for that test case; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases) and `n` (a list of integers where each element represents the largest number for each test case). It returns a list of boolean values, where each value is `True` if the corresponding largest number in `n` is even, and `False` if it is odd.**
