The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range `10`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `10`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The range `10` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 1, `i` is 2, `values[1]` is 1, `sum_values[1]` is 1.**
