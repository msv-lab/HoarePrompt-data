The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 11 and `n` is greater than or equal to 11. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to 12, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 12.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 45, `i` is 12, `n` must be greater than or equal to 12, `word` is "11", `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `values[10]` is 0, `sum_values[10]` is 0, `sum_total` is 0, `values[11]` is 0, `sum_values[11]` is 0**
