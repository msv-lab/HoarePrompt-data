Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 0, `i` is 0, `values[0]` is 0.**

The code `total += i` does not change the value of `total` because `i` is 0. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
