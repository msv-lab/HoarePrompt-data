Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: t and n, where t is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and n is a list of integers where each element represents the largest number for each test case (1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5).**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def func_1(t, n):
```

With the corrected function definition, the precondition is:

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and n is a list of integers where each element n[i] satisfies (1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5).**
