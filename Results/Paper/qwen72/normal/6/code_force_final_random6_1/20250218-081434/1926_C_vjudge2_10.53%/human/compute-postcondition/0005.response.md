The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing the input integer `n`, and `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` is decreased by 1, so `t` must now be greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing the input integer `n`, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.**
