The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range value `10`. The loop will execute 10 times regardless of the values of `t`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`, and `total`. However, to ensure that the loop can start its first iteration, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to reflect its initial value before the loop starts.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
