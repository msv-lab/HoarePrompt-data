You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]

        sum_values[i] = sum_total
    for n in numbers:

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, and then reads `t` integers, each representing the largest number for each test case. It calculates the sum of a sequence of values for each number up to the largest number in the test cases, where each value is determined by the sum of the value of the last digit and the value of the remaining digits of the number. The function prints the cumulative sum of these values for each test case number. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then reads `t` integers, each representing a value of `n`, and stores them in the list `numbers`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, are initialized to store the sum of digits for each number and the cumulative sum of these values, respectively.
   - The size of these lists is `max(numbers) + 1` to ensure they can hold values for the largest `n` in the test cases.

3. **Base Case:**
   - The first 10 values in `values` are set to their respective digits (0 to 9).
   - The cumulative sum `sum_values` is updated accordingly for the first 10 numbers.

4. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - For numbers from 10 to `n`, the function calculates the sum of digits using the previously computed values.
   - The sum of digits for a number `i` is calculated by converting `i` to a string, extracting the last digit, and the remainder of the number (all digits except the last one).
   - The sum of digits for `i` is then computed as the sum of the last digit and the sum of digits of the remainder.
   - The cumulative sum `sum_values` is updated for each `i`.

5. **Output:**
   - For each `n` in the `numbers` list, the function prints the cumulative sum of the sum of digits up to `n`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Sum Calculation:**
  - The sum of digits for numbers from 1 to 9 is correctly initialized.
  - For numbers greater than 9, the sum of digits is calculated using the last digit and the remainder, which is a valid approach.
  - The cumulative sum `sum_values` is correctly updated for each number.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The function uses dynamic programming to avoid recalculating the sum of digits for each number, which is efficient.
  - However, the function calculates the sum of digits for all numbers up to the maximum `n` in the test cases, which might be unnecessary if the test cases have different values of `n`.

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The time complexity of the function is \(O(n)\) for the dynamic programming part, where `n` is the maximum number in the test cases.
  - Given the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test and the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), the function should be able to handle the input within the time limit.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct in terms of logic and should produce the correct output for the given problem. However, it can be optimized to avoid unnecessary calculations for each test case.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
