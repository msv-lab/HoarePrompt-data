Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 45, `i` is 11, `n` must be greater than or equal to 11, `word` is "11", `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `values[10]` is 0, `sum_values[10]` is 0, `sum_total` is 0**

Explanation:
- `last` is assigned the value of the last character of `word` converted to an integer. Since `word` is "11", the last character is "1", and `int("1")` is 1.
- The values of `t`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`, `total`, `i`, `n`, `word`, `remainder`, `values[10]`, `sum_values[10]`, and `sum_total` remain unchanged.
