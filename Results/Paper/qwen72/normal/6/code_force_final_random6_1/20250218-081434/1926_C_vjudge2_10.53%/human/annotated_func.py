#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, and then reads `t` integers, each representing the largest number for each test case. It calculates the sum of a sequence of values for each number up to the largest number in the test cases, where each value is determined by the sum of the value of the last digit and the value of the remaining digits of the number. The function prints the cumulative sum of these values for each test case number. The function does not return any value.
