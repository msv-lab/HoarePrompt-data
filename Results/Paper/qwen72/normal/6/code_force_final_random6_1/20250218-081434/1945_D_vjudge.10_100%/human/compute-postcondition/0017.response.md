Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes five parameters: `pergunta` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `a` (a list of integers), `b` (a list of integers), `n` (a non-negative integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill), and `m` (a non-negative integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill). It modifies the value of `pergunta` based on the elements of `a` and `b` and the constraints defined by `m`. The function prints the final value of `pergunta`, which is the minimum value between the original `pergunta` and the sum of `x` and `a[i]` for all `i` where `i < m`, where `x` is the sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the function does not return any value. **
