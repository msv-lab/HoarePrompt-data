Output State: **`pergunta` is updated to the minimum value between the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`, `a` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `b` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is `x + min(a[n-1], b[n-1])`, `i` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `pergunta` to the minimum value between the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`.
- The value of `x` is `x + min(a[n-1], b[n-1])`, which means `x` is increased by the minimum value of the last elements of `a` and `b`.
- The value of `i` is `n - 2`, which means `i` is set to the second-to-last index of the lists `a` and `b`.
- The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- The condition `i < m` is checked, but it does not affect the output state directly; it only influences whether `pergunta` is updated. If `i` is less than `m`, `pergunta` is updated to the minimum value between the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`. If `i` is not less than `m`, `pergunta` remains unchanged.
