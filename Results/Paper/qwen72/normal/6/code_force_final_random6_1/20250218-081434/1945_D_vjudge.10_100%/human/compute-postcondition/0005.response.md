Output State: **`pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), `a` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `b` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is `x + min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` is `n - 1`. If `i` is less than `m`, `pergunta` is updated to the minimum value between the original `pergunta` and `a[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is incremented by the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- The value of `i` remains `n - 1`.
- The value of `pergunta` is updated to the minimum value between the original `pergunta` and `a[i]` if `i` is less than `m`.
- The states of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
