You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCasos`).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')`, which is a good choice to ensure it starts with the highest possible value and can be updated with the minimum cost.

3. **Loop and Cost Calculation:**
   - The program iterates over the list `a` and `b` in reverse order, starting from the last person in the queue (`n-1`).
   - For each person `i`:
     - If `i` is less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of its current value and the sum of `x` and `a[i]`. This step is intended to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position `j` such that `j < i` and `j < m`.
     - It then adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`. This step is intended to accumulate the cost of moving past each person in the queue.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the value of `pergunta`, which should be the minimum cost for Kirill to be among the first `m` people in the queue.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- The program aims to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position `j` such that `j < m`.
- The loop iterates in reverse order, which is correct because Kirill starts at the end of the queue and can only move forward.
- The update `pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])` is intended to find the minimum cost to move to a position `j` where `j < i` and `j < m`.
- The accumulation `x += min(a[i], b[i])` is intended to account for the cost of moving past each person in the queue.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic:
- The program does not correctly account for the cost of moving past multiple people in a single move. Specifically, if Kirill moves from position `i` to position `j` where `j < i`, he should pay `a[j]` and `b[k]` for each `k` such that `j < k < i`. The current implementation only adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`, which is not sufficient to handle the cost of moving past multiple people.

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position `j` such that `j < m` because it does not account for the cumulative cost of moving past multiple people in a single move.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
