Output State: **`pergunta` is updated to the minimum value between the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]` if `i` is less than `m`; otherwise, `pergunta` remains unchanged. `a` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `b` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is `x + min(a[n-2], b[n-2])`, `i` is `n - 3`.**

Explanation:
- The code `pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])` updates the value of `pergunta` to the minimum between its original value and `x + a[i]`.
- If `i` is less than `m`, `pergunta` is updated as described.
- If `i` is not less than `m`, `pergunta` remains unchanged.
- The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `x`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state.
