Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the initial value of `pergunta` set to `float('inf')`, but the function does not return any value. Instead, it directly prints the result. This is not a good practice and can lead to unexpected behavior if the function is used in a more complex context.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic inside `func_1` is flawed. The program attempts to calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position less than or equal to `m` by iterating from the end of the queue to the beginning. However, the way it calculates the cost is incorrect.
   - The variable `x` is supposed to accumulate the cost of bribing people, but it is incremented by `min(a[i], b[i])` for each person. This does not correctly account for the cost of moving to a specific position.
   - The condition `if i < m:` is used to update `pergunta` with the minimum cost, but this does not consider the correct sequence of moves Kirill can make to reach a position `j` where `j < i`.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, you need to use a dynamic programming approach or a priority queue to keep track of the minimum cost to move to each position.
   - For each position `i`, you need to consider the cost of moving to all positions `j` where `j < i` and update the minimum cost accordingly.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem:

```python
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

def min_cost(n, m, a, b):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    dp[n] = 0  # Kirill starts at position n+1 (end of the queue)
    
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        dp[i] = dp[i + 1] + b[i]  # Cost to stay in the same position
        for j in range(i + 1, min(m, n + 1)):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + a[j - 1] + sum(b[i:j-1]))
    
    return min(dp[:m])

index = 0
numCasos = int(data[index])
index += 1

results = []
for _ in range(numCasos):
    n = int(data[index])
    m = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    b = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    results.append(min_cost(n, m, a, b))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The input is read in one go using `sys.stdin.read` and split into a list of strings. This is more efficient for large inputs.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost for Kirill to be in position `i` or better.
   - The program initializes `dp[n]` to 0 because Kirill starts at the end of the queue.
   - For each position `i` from `n-1` to `0`, it calculates the cost to stay in the same position (`dp[i] = dp[i + 1] + b[i]`) and the cost to move to any position `j` where `j < i` and `j < m`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results for each test case and prints them at the end.

This corrected program should correctly solve the problem as described.
