Postcondition: ***`pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), `a` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `b` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is `x + min(a[n-1], b[n-1])`, `i` is `n - 2`. If `i` is less than `m`, `pergunta` is updated to the minimum value between the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`. Otherwise, `pergunta` remains unchanged.***
