The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`, and the lists `a` and `b`. The loop is iterating in reverse, starting from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `a` and `b` are lists of `n` integers.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n - 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

State: **`pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), `a` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `b` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is `x + min(a[n-1], b[n-1])`, `i` is `n - 2`. If `i` is less than `m`, `pergunta` is updated to the minimum value between the original `pergunta` and `a[i]`.**
