The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the integers in the list. The input list `numbers` must contain at least one integer. After the function concludes, the program state is such that the GCD of all elements in `numbers` is returned, and the input list `numbers` remains unchanged.
