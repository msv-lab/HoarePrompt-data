### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), if it wins, the amount received is \(k_i \times x_i\), where \(x_i\) is the bet on outcome \(i\).
   - The total amount bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\).
   - The condition to satisfy is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \(n\) and the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers \(k_i\) and stores it in \(m\).
   - It then calculates the bet for each outcome \(x_i\) as \(m / k_i\).
   - It computes the highest common factor (HCF) of all bets \(x_i\) using the function `func_1`.
   - It reduces each bet by dividing it by the HCF.
   - It checks if the sum of the reduced bets is less than \(m / \text{HCF}\). If it is, it prints the reduced bets; otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

3. **Mathematical Justification:**
   - The product \(m\) of all multipliers \(k_i\) ensures that each \(x_i = m / k_i\) is an integer.
   - The HCF of all \(x_i\) is used to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the same ratios.
   - The condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < m / \text{HCF}\) ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all multipliers \(k_i\) are the same, the program correctly identifies that no solution exists (since the sum of bets would equal the product divided by the HCF).
   - For different multipliers, the program correctly calculates the bets and checks the condition.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the HCF of a list of numbers using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.

### Annotated Code Analysis:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `t` is the number of test cases.
  - `n` is the number of outcomes for the current test case.
  - `k` is a list of multipliers for the current test case.
  - `m` is the product of all multipliers \(k_i\).
  - `c` is a list of bets \(x_i\) calculated as \(m / k_i\).
  - `hcf` is the highest common factor of all bets in `c`.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function correctly computes the HCF of the list `numbers` using the `gcd` function.
  - The HCF is used to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the same ratios.

- **Condition Check:**
  - The program checks if the sum of the reduced bets is less than \(m / \text{HCF}\).
  - If the condition is not met, it prints \(-1\).
  - If the condition is met, it prints the reduced bets.

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness of the Program:**
  - The program correctly calculates the product \(m\) of all multipliers \(k_i\).
  - The bets \(x_i\) are correctly calculated as \(m / k_i\).
  - The HCF of the bets is correctly computed using the `func_1` function.
  - The program correctly reduces the bets by dividing them by the HCF.
  - The condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < m / \text{HCF}\) is correctly checked to ensure that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where all multipliers \(k_i\) are the same by correctly identifying that no solution exists.
  - The program handles different multipliers by correctly calculating the bets and checking the condition.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins as required by the problem statement. It handles the edge cases and ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

Final: **True**
