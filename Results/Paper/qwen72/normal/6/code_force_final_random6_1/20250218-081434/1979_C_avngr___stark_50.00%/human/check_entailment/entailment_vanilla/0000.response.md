### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), if it wins, the amount received is \(k_i \times x_i\), where \(x_i\) is the bet on outcome \(i\).
   - The total amount bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\).
   - The condition to satisfy is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \(n\) and the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers \(k_i\) and stores it in \(m\).
   - It then calculates the bet for each outcome \(x_i\) as \(m / k_i\).
   - It computes the highest common factor (HCF) of all bets \(x_i\) using the function `func_1`.
   - It reduces each bet by dividing it by the HCF.
   - It checks if the sum of the reduced bets is less than \(m / \text{HCF}\). If it is, it prints the reduced bets; otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

3. **Mathematical Justification:**
   - The product \(m\) of all multipliers \(k_i\) ensures that each \(x_i = m / k_i\) is an integer.
   - The HCF of all \(x_i\) is used to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the same ratios.
   - The condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < m / \text{HCF}\) ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all multipliers \(k_i\) are the same, the program correctly identifies that no solution exists (since the sum of bets would equal the product divided by the HCF).
   - For different multipliers, the program correctly calculates the bets and checks the condition.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the HCF of a list of numbers using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins as required by the problem statement. It handles the edge cases and ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

Correctness: **True**
