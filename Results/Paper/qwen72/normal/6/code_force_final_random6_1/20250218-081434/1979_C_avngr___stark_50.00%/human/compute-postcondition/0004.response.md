The value of `hcf` is updated to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the current `hcf` and `num`. The current `hcf` is the GCD of the first and second elements of `numbers`, and `num` is the third element of `numbers`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples as described, `numbers` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of `numbers`, `hcf` is the GCD of the first, second, and third elements of `numbers`.**
