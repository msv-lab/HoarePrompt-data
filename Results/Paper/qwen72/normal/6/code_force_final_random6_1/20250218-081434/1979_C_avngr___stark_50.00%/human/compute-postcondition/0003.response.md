The only objects in the loop head are the list `numbers` and the variable `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If `numbers` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` has at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of `numbers`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `numbers` must have at least 3 elements, and `num` will be the third element of `numbers`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples as described, `numbers` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of `numbers`, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the first and second elements of `numbers`**
