Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem by calculating a set of bets that ensure the player wins more coins than they bet in total, regardless of which outcome wins. The approach taken is to calculate a common multiple of the multipliers \( k_i \) and then distribute the bets based on this multiple. However, the program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Calculation of `m`**: The program calculates `m` as the product of all \( k_i \) values. This is not necessary and can lead to very large numbers, which might cause overflow issues or unnecessary complexity. Instead, a more efficient approach is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the \( k_i \) values, but the program does not do this.

2. **Calculation of `c`**: The program then calculates `c` as the list of values \( \frac{m}{k_i} \). This is intended to ensure that the total sum of bets is less than the return for any winning outcome. However, this approach is flawed because it does not necessarily guarantee that the sum of `c` is less than the total return for any winning outcome.

3. **GCD Calculation**: The program calculates the GCD of the `c` values and divides each element of `c` by this GCD to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the same ratios. This is a good step, but it is not sufficient to ensure the correctness of the solution.

4. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of the `c` values is less than \( \frac{m}{\text{hcf}} \). This check is intended to ensure that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome. However, this check is not robust enough because the `m` value is not the LCM of the \( k_i \) values, and the sum of `c` values might not be the correct total bet.

5. **Output**: If the sum of `c` is not less than \( \frac{m}{\text{hcf}} \), the program outputs `-1`, indicating no solution. Otherwise, it outputs the `c` values.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem in all cases. For example, in the case where all \( k_i \) values are the same, the program will output `-1` even though a valid solution exists.

Correctness: **False**

To correct the program, a more efficient and robust approach would be to use the LCM of the \( k_i \) values and then distribute the bets accordingly, ensuring the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.
