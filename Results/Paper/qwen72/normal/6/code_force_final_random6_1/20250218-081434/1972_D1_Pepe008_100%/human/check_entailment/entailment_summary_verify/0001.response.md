### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be simplified using the properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd). If \(d = \gcd(a, b)\), then \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\).
   - Substituting these into the condition, we get:
     \[
     d \cdot a' + d \cdot b' = d \cdot (a' + b')
     \]
     This must be a multiple of \(b \cdot d = d^2 \cdot b'\).
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     a' + b' \text{ must be a multiple of } b'
     \]
   - Since \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\), \(a' + b'\) must be a multiple of \(b'\), which implies \(a' \equiv -b' \pmod{b'}\). This means \(a' = k \cdot b' - b'\) for some integer \(k\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values using the formula:
     \[
     x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - This formula is not correct. It does not correctly account for the gcd condition and the multiple condition.
   - The additional check:
     \[
     \text{if } (a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0 \text{ and } i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0:
     \]
     This check is also incorrect and unnecessary. It does not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The formula used to calculate \(x\) is not derived from the correct mathematical insight and does not correctly count the valid pairs.
   - The additional check is flawed and does not contribute to the correct solution.
   - The program subtracts 2 from the final sum, which is not justified based on the problem statement.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each \(b\), we need to count the number of \(a\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be done by iterating over all possible \(a\) and checking the condition directly. However, a more efficient approach would be to use the properties of gcd and modular arithmetic to count the valid pairs.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. The formula and the additional checks are flawed.
   - The program does not produce the correct output for the given test cases.
