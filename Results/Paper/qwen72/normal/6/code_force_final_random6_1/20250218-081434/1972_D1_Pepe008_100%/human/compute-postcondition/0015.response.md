Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 2, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2`, `suma` is increased by `x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is calculated as `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(a - 2 * 1) // 2` or `(a - 2) // 2`.
- The variable `suma` is incremented by the value of `x`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged.
