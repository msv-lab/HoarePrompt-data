Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 2, `i` is 3, `x` is now `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is now `suma + x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.
- The value of `suma` is incremented by the value of `x`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged.
