Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used in the program to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) is flawed. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`:**
   - The expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not correctly determine the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(b\). This expression seems to be an attempt to count the number of \(a\) values that satisfy the condition, but it is not derived correctly from the problem constraints.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Valid Pairs:**
   - The condition `if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is not necessary and does not align with the problem's requirements. The problem states that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), and this condition does not check that.

3. **Subtracting 2:**
   - The final `print(suma - 2)` is incorrect. There is no reason to subtract 2 from the sum of valid pairs. This is an arbitrary operation that does not align with the problem's constraints.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        result = count_valid_pairs(n, m)
        print(result)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:
- **Function `count_valid_pairs(n, m)`:**
  - This function iterates over all pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
  - For each pair, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using `math.gcd(a, b)`.
  - It then checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) using the condition `(a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0`.
  - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count.

- **Function `func()`:**
  - This function reads the number of test cases \(T\) and processes each test case.
  - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\) and calls `count_valid_pairs(n, m)` to get the result.
  - It prints the result for each test case.

This approach ensures that all valid pairs are counted correctly and aligns with the problem's constraints.
