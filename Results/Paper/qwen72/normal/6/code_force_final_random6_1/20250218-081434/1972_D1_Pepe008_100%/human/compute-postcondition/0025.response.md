Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is at least `b`, `i` is `b`, `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated in the loop, where `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` for each `i` from 1 to `b`, and `suma` is incremented by 1 for each `i` where `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
- **`T` and `t`**: These variables also remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
- **`a` and `b`**: These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `b` because the loop runs from 1 to `b` inclusive.
- **`suma`**: This variable accumulates the values of `x` for each iteration of the loop. The value of `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` for each `i` from 1 to `b`. Additionally, `suma` is incremented by 1 for each `i` where the conditions `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are both true.
