Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. Specifically, the logic used to determine the number of valid pairs is flawed. Here is a potential case where the program does not work correctly:

**Test Case:**
```
1
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

The expected output is 3 because the valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). However, the program outputs 1, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the way the program calculates the number of valid pairs. The formula used in the program:
```python
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```
and the subsequent checks:
```python
if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
    suma += x
    if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
        suma += 1
```
do not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description. The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs (a, b) and checking if the sum \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current logic does not ensure this condition is met for all pairs.
