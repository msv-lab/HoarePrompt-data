Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 2, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2 ** 2 + 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2 ** 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
