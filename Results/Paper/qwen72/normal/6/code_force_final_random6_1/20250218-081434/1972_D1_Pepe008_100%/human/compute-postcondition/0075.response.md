Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 0, `i` is `b + 2`, `x` is `(a - i * (b + 1)) // i`, `suma` is `suma + (a - i * (b + 1)) // i`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, then `suma` is `suma + (a - i * (b + 1)) // i + 1`.***
