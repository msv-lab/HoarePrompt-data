Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 0, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from user input, `x` is the result of the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and the expression `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1)` is greater than 0.**
