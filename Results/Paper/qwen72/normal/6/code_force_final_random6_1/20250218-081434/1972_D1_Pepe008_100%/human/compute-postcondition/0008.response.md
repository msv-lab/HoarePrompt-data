Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1`, `i` is 1, `x` is `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1`, and the expression `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i` is evaluated and added to `suma`.**

In natural language: The value of `suma` is updated to the result of the expression `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1`, which is the same as `a`. The value of `i` remains 1, and the expression `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i` is evaluated and added to `suma`, so `suma` is now `2 * a`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
