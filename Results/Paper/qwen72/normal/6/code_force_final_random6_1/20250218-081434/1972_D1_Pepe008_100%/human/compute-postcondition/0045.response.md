The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `b + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `b` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `b` must still be at least 1 for the condition `i < b + 1` to hold true.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 3, and `suma` is 0.**
