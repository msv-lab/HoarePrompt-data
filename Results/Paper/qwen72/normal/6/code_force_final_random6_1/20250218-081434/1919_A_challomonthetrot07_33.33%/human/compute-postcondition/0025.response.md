Postcondition: ***`T` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, and `a` is not equal to `b`. Additionally, `a` is not equal to 1. If `b` is 1, the current value of `b` is 1. If `b` is not 1, `b` retains its value and parity (odd or even), and the relationship between `a` and `b` (whether `a` is greater than, less than, or equal to `b`) remains unchanged.***
