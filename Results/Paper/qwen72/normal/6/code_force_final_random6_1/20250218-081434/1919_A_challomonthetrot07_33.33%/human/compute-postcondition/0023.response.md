Postcondition: ***`T` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a` is not equal to `b`, `a` is not equal to 1, `b` is not equal to 1, and `a` is even. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, then `b` remains odd. If `a` is even and `b` is even, or if `a` is odd, then `b` is even or `a` is odd. If `a` is greater than `b`, `a` remains greater than `b`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, `a` remains less than or equal to `b`.***
