Postcondition: ***`T` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a` is not equal to `b`, `a` is not equal to 1, and `b` is not equal to 1. If `a` is odd, `a` remains an odd integer. If `a` is even, `a` remains an even integer, and `b` retains its parity (odd or even). If `a` is greater than `b`, `a` remains greater than `b`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, `a` remains less than or equal to `b`.***
