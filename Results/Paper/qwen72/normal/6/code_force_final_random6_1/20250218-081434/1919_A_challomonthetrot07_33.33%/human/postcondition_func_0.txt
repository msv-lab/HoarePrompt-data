The function `func` reads an integer `T` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= T <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, where `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`. It then determines and prints the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob') based on the following rules: If `a` is equal to `b`, 'Bob' wins. If `a` is 1, 'Alice' wins. If `b` is 1, 'Bob' wins. If `a` is odd, 'Bob' wins. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, 'Alice' wins. If `a` is greater than `b`, 'Bob' wins. Otherwise, 'Alice' wins. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is unchanged except for the output printed to the console.
