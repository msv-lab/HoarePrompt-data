Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where both `a` and `b` are greater than 1 and both are even. According to the game rules, if both players have an even number of coins, the player with the smaller number of coins will eventually win because they can always force the other player to make the last move by keeping the number of coins in their wallet even. However, the program incorrectly assumes that if `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice will always win, and if `a` is greater than `b`, Bob will always win. This is not always true.

For example, consider the case where `a = 4` and `b = 2`:
- Alice starts with 4 coins, Bob with 2 coins.
- Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob, making `a = 1` and `b = 3`.
- Bob then has to remove a coin, making `a = 1` and `b = 2`.
- Alice can swap wallets again, making `a = 0` and `b = 1`.
- Bob cannot make a move because his wallet is empty, so Alice wins.

However, the program will output "Bob" for this case, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
