To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the sequence `a`.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
- The input must have at least 5 lines.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `line`**:
   - The variable `line` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is implied that `line` is a string of tokens separated by spaces. This string is likely read from input, and each line represents a test case.
   - Since the input must have at least 5 lines, `line` is one of these lines.

2. **Splitting `line`**:
   - `line.split()` splits the string `line` into a list of tokens based on spaces.
   - For example, if `line = "1 2 3 4 5"`, then `tokens = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]`.

3. **Calculating `len(tokens)`**:
   - `len(tokens)` gives the number of tokens in the list.
   - For the example `tokens = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]`, `len(tokens) = 5`.

4. **Creating a Set of Tokens**:
   - `{*tokens}` creates a set from the list of tokens, which removes duplicates.
   - For the example `tokens = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]`, the set `{*tokens} = {"1", "2", "3", "4", "5"}`.
   - If `tokens` had duplicates, the set would only contain unique elements. For example, if `tokens = ["1", "2", "3", "2", "4"]`, then `{*tokens} = {"1", "2", "3", "4"}`.

5. **Calculating `len({*tokens})`**:
   - `len({*tokens})` gives the number of unique tokens in the set.
   - For the example `tokens = ["1", "2", "3", "2", "4"]`, `len({*tokens}) = 4`.

6. **Final Calculation**:
   - The expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` calculates the difference between the total number of tokens and the number of unique tokens.
   - This difference represents the number of duplicate tokens in the list `tokens`.

### Example Calculation:
- If `line = "1 2 3 2 4"`, then:
  - `tokens = ["1", "2", "3", "2", "4"]`
  - `len(tokens) = 5`
  - `{*tokens} = {"1", "2", "3", "4"}`
  - `len({*tokens}) = 4`
  - `len(tokens) - len({*tokens}) = 5 - 4 = 1`

### General Output:
- The code snippet will print the number of duplicate tokens in the line.
- Since the input must have at least 5 lines, the output will be the number of duplicates for the specific line being processed.

### Final Output:
Output: **number of duplicate tokens in the line (where the line is one of the input lines and the number of duplicate tokens is the difference between the total number of tokens and the number of unique tokens in the line)**
