The loop head involves the variable `line` and the expression `[*open(0)][2::2]`. To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that the expression `[*open(0)][2::2]` produces a non-empty list. Let's break this down step by step:

1. `open(0)` opens the standard input (file descriptor 0) and returns a file object.
2. `[*open(0)]` reads all lines from the standard input and converts them into a list.
3. `[2::2]` slices the list starting from the third element (index 2) and takes every second element thereafter.

For the loop to execute, the list `[*open(0)]` must have at least three elements, because the slice starts from the third element. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input has at least three lines.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the sequence `a`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The input must have at least 3 lines.**
