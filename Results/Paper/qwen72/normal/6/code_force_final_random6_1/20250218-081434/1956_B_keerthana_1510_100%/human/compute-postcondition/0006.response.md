Output State: **The loop has processed all the lines in the input, and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the sequence `a`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the input file has been fully processed. The loop reads every other line starting from the third line, and for each of these lines, it calculates the difference between the number of tokens in the line and the number of unique tokens. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged, and the sum of `n` over all test cases still does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The loop has completed its task, and no more lines are left to be processed.
