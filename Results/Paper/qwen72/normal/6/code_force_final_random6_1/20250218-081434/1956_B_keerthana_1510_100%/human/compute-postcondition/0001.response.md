To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the sequence `a`.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
- The input must have at least 3 lines.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding the `line` variable:**
   - The code snippet uses a variable `line` which is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, based on the context, `line` is likely a string that represents a line of input.
   - Given that the input must have at least 3 lines, `line` could be any of these lines. For the purpose of this analysis, we will assume `line` is a string containing space-separated integers.

2. **Splitting the `line` into tokens:**
   - `line.split()` splits the string `line` into a list of tokens based on spaces. Each token is a string representation of an integer.
   - For example, if `line = "1 2 3 2 1"`, then `tokens` will be `["1", "2", "3", "2", "1"]`.

3. **Calculating the length of `tokens`:**
   - `len(tokens)` returns the number of tokens in the list.
   - For the example `tokens = ["1", "2", "3", "2", "1"]`, `len(tokens)` will be 5.

4. **Creating a set of unique tokens:**
   - `{*tokens}` creates a set of unique tokens from the list `tokens`.
   - For the example `tokens = ["1", "2", "3", "2", "1"]`, the set `{*tokens}` will be `{"1", "2", "3"}`.
   - The length of this set is 3.

5. **Calculating the difference:**
   - `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` computes the difference between the number of tokens and the number of unique tokens.
   - For the example, this difference is \(5 - 3 = 2\).

### Final Output:
The code snippet will print the difference between the number of tokens in the line and the number of unique tokens in the line.

Output: **len(tokens) - len({*tokens}) (where `tokens` is the list of tokens obtained by splitting `line` and `{*tokens}` is the set of unique tokens from `tokens`)**

### Example Calculation:
If `line = "1 2 3 2 1"`, then:
- `tokens = ["1", "2", "3", "2", "1"]`
- `len(tokens) = 5`
- `{*tokens} = {"1", "2", "3"}`
- `len({*tokens}) = 3`
- `len(tokens) - len({*tokens}) = 5 - 3 = 2`

So, the output for this specific example would be:
Output: **2**

However, without the exact value of `line`, the output can be described more generally as:
Output: **len(tokens) - len({*tokens}) (where `tokens` is the list of tokens obtained by splitting `line` and `{*tokens}` is the set of unique tokens from `tokens`)**
