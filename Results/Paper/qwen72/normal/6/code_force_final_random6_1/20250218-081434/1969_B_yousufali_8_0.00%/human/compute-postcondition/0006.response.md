Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment, and the function `func_1` has been called.**

Explanation: The function `func_1` is called, but since the function's implementation is not provided, we cannot determine any changes to the variables or the state of the program. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
