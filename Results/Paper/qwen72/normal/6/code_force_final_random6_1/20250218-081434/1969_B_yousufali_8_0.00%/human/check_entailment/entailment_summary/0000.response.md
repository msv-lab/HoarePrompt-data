**Reasoning:**

The problem requires us to determine the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on any chosen substring. The cost of each operation is the length of the chosen substring.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Input Handling:** `func_1` reads a binary string from the user, but it incorrectly splits the input using `input().split()`, which is meant for splitting a string by whitespace. Since the input is a single binary string, this will result in a list containing a single element, which is the entire string. This is a mistake.
- **Logic for Cost Calculation:** The function iterates through the string and counts the number of 1s (`n`). For each 0 that follows at least one 1, it adds `n + 1` to the total cost (`ans`). This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the actual operations needed to sort the string.
- **Output:** The function prints the calculated cost but does not return it, which is fine for the problem's requirements.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Input Handling:** `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
- **Function Calls:** The function correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` `t` times.

### Issues:
1. **Input Handling in `func_1`:** The input should be read as a single string and then converted to a list of integers, not split by whitespace.
2. **Cost Calculation in `func_1`:** The logic for calculating the cost is flawed. The correct approach should involve identifying the positions where the string needs to be cyclically shifted to achieve a sorted order. The current logic does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the string.

### Correct Approach:
- **Identify the Transition Points:** The key to solving this problem is to identify the points where the string transitions from 1 to 0. The cost to sort the string is the sum of the lengths of the substrings that need to be cyclically shifted to move all 1s to the front and all 0s to the back.
- **Calculate the Cost:** For each transition from 1 to 0, the cost is the length of the substring from the first 1 to the current 0. This can be optimized by keeping track of the number of 1s and 0s and calculating the minimum cost accordingly.

Given the issues in `func_1`, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: **False****

The program is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly handle the input and the logic for calculating the minimum cost to sort the string is flawed.
