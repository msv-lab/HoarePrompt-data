The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is not used outside the loop context.

Since the state before the loop starts already specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, this ensures that `t` is at least 1, which means the loop will execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment**
