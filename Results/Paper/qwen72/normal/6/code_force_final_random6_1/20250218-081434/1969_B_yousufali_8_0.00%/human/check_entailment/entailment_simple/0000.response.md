Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Processing in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` reads a binary string `s` from the input and converts it into a list of integers.
   - It initializes `n` to 0, which will keep track of the number of 1s encountered so far.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost to sort the string.
   - The function iterates over each character in the list `s`:
     - If the character is 1, it increments `n`.
     - If the character is 0 and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Logic for Sorting Cost Calculation**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is designed to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
   - The cost is calculated by summing `n + 1` for each 0 that follows at least one 1, where `n` is the number of 1s encountered before the 0.
   - This is because each 0 that follows a 1 can be moved to the front of the string by cyclically shifting the substring from the first 1 to the current 0, and the cost of such a shift is `n + 1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), `n` will be 0 when encountering the first 0, and `ans` will remain 0, which is correct.
   - If the string contains no 0s (e.g., "1111"), `ans` will be 0, which is correct.
   - If the string contains no 1s (e.g., "0000"), `ans` will be 0, which is correct.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input "10", the function will output 2, which is correct.
   - For the input "0000", the function will output 0, which is correct.
   - For the input "11000", the function will output 9, which is correct.
   - For the input "101011", the function will output 5, which is correct.
   - For the input "01101001", the function will output 11, which is correct.

6. **Input Format**:
   - The input format is correctly handled by `func_2` and `func_1`. Each test case is processed independently, and the input is read as expected.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
