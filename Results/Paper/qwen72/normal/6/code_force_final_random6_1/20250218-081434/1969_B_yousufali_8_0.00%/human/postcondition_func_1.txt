The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the integer `t` is still in memory, and `func_1` has been executed `t` times.
