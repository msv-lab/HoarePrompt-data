Output State: **`s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with the same length as the initial list, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `n` is the number of 1s in the list `s`, and `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 in `s` that follows at least one 1.**

In natural language, this means:
- The list `s` remains unchanged.
- The variable `i` has reached the last index of the list `s`, which is `len(s) - 1`.
- The variable `n` now holds the total count of 1s in the list `s`.
- The variable `ans` has been incremented by `n + 1` for each 0 in `s` that is preceded by at least one 1. If there are no 0s in `s` that are preceded by 1s, `ans` remains 0.
