Let's break down the task step by step based on the initial state:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with the same length as the initial list.
   - `i` is `len(s) - 1`, which means `i` is the index of the last element in the list `s`.
   - `n` is the number of 1s in the list `s`.
   - `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 in `s` that follows at least one 1.

2. **Understanding `ans`**:
   - `ans` is calculated by summing `n + 1` for each 0 in `s` that comes after at least one 1.
   - This means we need to count the number of 0s in `s` that are preceded by at least one 1, and for each such 0, we add `n + 1` to `ans`.

3. **Example Calculation**:
   - Suppose `s = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]`.
   - `n` is the number of 1s in `s`, which is 2.
   - We need to count the 0s that follow at least one 1:
     - The first 0 is at index 1 and follows a 1 at index 0.
     - The second 0 is at index 3 and follows a 1 at index 2.
     - The third 0 is at index 4 and follows a 1 at index 2.
   - For each of these 0s, we add `n + 1` to `ans`:
     - `ans = (2 + 1) + (2 + 1) + (2 + 1) = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9`.

4. **General Case**:
   - If `s` is a list of 0s and 1s, we need to count the number of 0s that are preceded by at least one 1.
   - For each such 0, we add `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific configuration of 0s and 1s in the list `s`.

5. **Output**:
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` as calculated above.
   - Since the exact configuration of `s` is not provided, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables and conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of n + 1 for each 0 in s that follows at least one 1, and n is the number of 1s in the list s)**
