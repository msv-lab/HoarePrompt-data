Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input and output as specified in the problem description. Specifically:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is reading the input string as a list of integers using `list(map(int, input().split()))`. This is incorrect because the input is a binary string, not a list of integers. The correct way to read the input string would be `s = input().strip()`.

2. **Output Handling**: The function `func_1` is printing the result directly, which is not appropriate for a function that is supposed to return a value. The output should be printed in `func_2` after calling `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Logic**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the string sorted. For example, for the string "101011", the program will output an incorrect result because it does not consider the optimal strategy for cyclic shifts.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    ones = 0
    cost = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            ones += 1
        else:
            cost += ones
    return cost

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        print(min_cost_to_sort(s))
```

This corrected version correctly reads the input as a binary string, calculates the minimum cost to sort the string, and prints the result for each test case.
