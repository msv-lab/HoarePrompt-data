You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used. The function reads input from the user, expecting a binary string represented as a list of integers (0s and 1s).
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with the same length as the initial list, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `n` is the number of 1s in the list `s`, and `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 in `s` that follows at least one 1.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of n + 1 for each 0 in s that follows at least one 1, and n is the number of 1s in the list s)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, but the function assumes that `input()` will provide a valid integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and that `func_1()` is defined and will handle the processing of each test case.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and the function `func_1` has been called `t` times.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input and output as specified in the problem description. Specifically:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is reading the input string as a list of integers using `list(map(int, input().split()))`. This is incorrect because the input is a binary string, not a list of integers. The correct way to read the input string would be `s = input().strip()`.

2. **Output Handling**: The function `func_1` is printing the result directly, which is not appropriate for a function that is supposed to return a value. The output should be printed in `func_2` after calling `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Logic**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the string sorted. For example, for the string "101011", the program will output an incorrect result because it does not consider the optimal strategy for cyclic shifts.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    ones = 0
    cost = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            ones += 1
        else:
            cost += ones
    return cost

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        print(min_cost_to_sort(s))
```

This corrected version correctly reads the input as a binary string, calculates the minimum cost to sort the string, and prints the result for each test case.
