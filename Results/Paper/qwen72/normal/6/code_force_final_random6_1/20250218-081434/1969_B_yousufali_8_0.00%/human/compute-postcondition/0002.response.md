Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment

```
func_1()
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code calls the function `func_1()`. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we cannot determine its exact impact on the variables. However, we can assume that the function might modify variables or return a value. Without the function definition, we can only state that the function has been called and that `t` and `_` remain unchanged unless `func_1()` explicitly modifies them.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment.**
