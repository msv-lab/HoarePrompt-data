Output State: **`L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input provided by the user, `n` is the number of elements in `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second integer in `L` and the third integer in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cost` is updated by adding `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` to its current value.
- The other variables (`L`, `t`, `_`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`) remain unchanged but are still part of the output state.
