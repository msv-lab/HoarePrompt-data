Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input provided by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second integer in `L` and the third integer in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q - 1` elements of the sorted `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `cost` is either `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m` is equal to `k`, or `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` if `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `mu = k - (n - 1) * m` assigns a new value to `mu`.
- `mu` is now equal to `k - (n - 1) * m`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
