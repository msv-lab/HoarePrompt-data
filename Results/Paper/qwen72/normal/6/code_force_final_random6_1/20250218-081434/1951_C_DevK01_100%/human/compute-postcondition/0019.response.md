Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed by the `print(cost)` statement.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `_` is 0.
3. `L` is a list of integers provided by the user.
4. `M` is a list of integers converted from the input provided by the user and sorted in ascending order.
5. `n` is the length of `N`.
6. `m` is the minimum of the second and third integers in `L`.
7. `k` is the third integer in `L`.
8. `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.
9. `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.
10. If `n * m` is equal to `k`, `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
11. Otherwise, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is calculated as `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `L` and `M`**:
   - `L` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `M` is a sorted list of integers derived from `L`.

2. **Variables `m` and `k`**:
   - `m` is the minimum of the second and third integers in `L`.
   - `k` is the third integer in `L`.

3. **Variable `q`**:
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.

4. **List `N`**:
   - `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.

5. **Variable `n`**:
   - `n` is the length of `N`.

6. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If `n * m` is equal to `k`, then `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, `N` is modified to contain the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is calculated as `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Final Output:
The `print(cost)` statement will print the value of `cost` based on the conditions described above. The exact numerical value of `cost` depends on the specific values of `L` and `M`, but we can describe it in terms of the given variables and conditions.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated as follows: if `n * m` is equal to `k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`, with `N` being the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element, `w` being the last element of the original `N`, and `mu` being `k - (n - 1) * m`)**.
