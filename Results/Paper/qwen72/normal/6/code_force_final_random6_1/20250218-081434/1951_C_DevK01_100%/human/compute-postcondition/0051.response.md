Output State: **`L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input provided by the user, `n` is the number of elements in `N` minus 1, `m` is the minimum of the second integer in `L` and the third integer in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `cost` is `mu * w`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cost` is calculated as `mu * w`.
- `mu` is already defined as `k - (n - 1) * m`.
- `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
- All other variables (`L`, `t`, `_`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
