To determine what will be printed by the `print(cost)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `L` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input provided by the user.
   - `n` is the number of elements in `N` (which is not defined yet, but we will determine it based on the conditions).
   - `m` is the minimum of the second integer in `L` and the third integer in `L`.
   - `k` is the third integer in `L`.
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.

2. **Conditions and Calculations:**
   - If `n * m == k`:
     - `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.
     - `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise:
     - `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`.
     - `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
     - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
     - `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - The value of `cost` depends on whether `n * m == k` or not.
   - Since `n` is the number of elements in `N`, and `N` is determined based on the value of `q`, we need to consider the two cases separately.

### Case 1: `n * m == k`
- In this case, `N` contains the first `q` elements of `M`.
- `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.

### Case 2: `n * m != k`
- In this case, `N` contains the first `q-1` elements of `M`.
- `w` is the last element of `N` (which is the `q-1`-th element of `M`).
- `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`.
- `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `L` and `M` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables and conditions.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the conditions provided: if `n * m == k`, then `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, otherwise `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`, with `N` being the first `q` or `q-1` elements of `M`, `m` being the minimum of the second and third integers in `L`, `k` being the third integer in `L`, and `mu` being `k - (n - 1) * m`)**.
