Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a list of integers converted from the input provided by the user and sorted in ascending order, `n` is the first integer in `L`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third integers in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.** 

In natural language: The initial state remains unchanged, but a new variable `q` is calculated as the ceiling of the division of `k` by `m`. The value of `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`.
