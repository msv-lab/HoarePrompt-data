Let's break down the provided initial state and the code step by step to determine what will be printed when the `print(cost)` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `_` is 1.
- `L` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input provided by the user.
- `n` is the length of `N`.
- `m` is the minimum of the second integer in `L` and the third integer in `L`.
- `k` is the third integer in `L`.
- `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.

### Conditions and Calculations:
1. **If `n * m` is equal to `k`:**
   - `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`.
   - `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.

2. **Otherwise:**
   - `N` is a list containing the first `q - 1` elements of the sorted `M`.
   - `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
   - `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.
   - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `m` and `k`:**
   - `m` is the minimum of the second and third integers in `L`.
   - `k` is the third integer in `L`.

2. **Calculate `q`:**
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.

3. **Check the condition `n * m == k`:**
   - If true, use the first formula to calculate `cost`.
   - If false, use the second formula to calculate `cost`.

4. **Calculate `cost` based on the condition:**
   - **If `n * m == k`:**
     - `N` is the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`.
     - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.

   - **Otherwise:**
     - `N` is the first `q - 1` elements of the sorted `M`.
     - `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
     - `mu = k - (n - 1) * m`.
     - `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `L` and `M` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables and conditions.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated as follows: if `n * m == k`, then `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, otherwise `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`, with `N` being the first `q` elements of the sorted `M` if `n * m == k`, or the first `q - 1` elements of the sorted `M` otherwise, `w` being the last element of the original `N`, and `mu` being `k - (n - 1) * m`)**.
