Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input provided by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second integer in `L` and the third integer in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q - 1` elements of the sorted `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cost` is updated by adding `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` to its current value.
- `sum(N)` is the sum of the first `q - 1` elements of the sorted list `M`.
- `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is the product of `m` squared and the sum of the first `n - 1` natural numbers.
- `n * m * mu` is the product of `n`, `m`, and `mu`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
