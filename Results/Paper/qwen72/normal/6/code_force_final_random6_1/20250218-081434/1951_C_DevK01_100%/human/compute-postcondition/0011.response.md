Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a list of integers converted from the input provided by the user and sorted in ascending order, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third integers in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, the product of `n` and `m` is equal to `k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**

Explanation:
- `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- `sum(N)` is the sum of the first `q` elements of `M`.
- `m * sum(N)` is the product of `m` and the sum of the first `q` elements of `M`.
- `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is the product of `m` squared and the sum of the first `n-1` integers, which is a triangular number.
- The value of `cost` is the sum of these two expressions.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
