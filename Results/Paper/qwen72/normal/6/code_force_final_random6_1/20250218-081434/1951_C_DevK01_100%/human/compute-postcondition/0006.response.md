The code `M.sort()` sorts the list `M` in ascending order. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `_`, `L`, `n`, `m`, or `k`. The only change is in the order of elements in `M`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a list of integers converted from the input provided by the user and sorted in ascending order, `n` is the first integer in `L`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third integers in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`.**
