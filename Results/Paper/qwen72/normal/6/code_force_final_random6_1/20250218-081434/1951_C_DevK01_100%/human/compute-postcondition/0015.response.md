Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a list of integers converted from the input provided by the user and sorted in ascending order, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third integers in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `cost` is assigned the value of `mu * w`.
- `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`.
- `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
