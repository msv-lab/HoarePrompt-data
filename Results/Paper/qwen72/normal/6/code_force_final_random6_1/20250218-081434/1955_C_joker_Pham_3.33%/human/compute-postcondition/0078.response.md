Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2, and `sunks` is 0, 1, or 2. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
