Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2, and `a[r] < a[l]` is true. If `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, then `sunks` is set to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all cases, `k` is less than twice the value of `a[r]`.***
