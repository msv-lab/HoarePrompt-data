Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `l` is 0 or 1, and `r` is n - 1 or n - 2. If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[r]`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, `r` is set to `n - 2` or `n - 3` (if `a[r]` becomes 0), and `sunks` is set to 1. If `a[l]` is 0 after the update, then `l` is set to 1 or 2, `sunks` is set to 2, and `a[r]` must be 0 or a positive integer less than `a[l]` before the subtraction. If `k` is less than `2 * a[r]`, then `a[r] < a[l]` remains true, and if `2 * a[r] - 1 == k`, `sunks` is set to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all cases, `k` is less than twice the value of `a[r]` after the if-else block executes.**
