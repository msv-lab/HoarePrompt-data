Output State: **`l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `l` equals `r`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `k` is now equal to `k - a[l] * 2`. `a[r]` is now equal to `a[r] - a[l]`. `sunks` is now `sunks + 1`. `r` is now `r - 1`.** 

In natural language: The value of `r` is decreased by 1. The conditions and changes to `l`, `r`, `sunks`, `k`, and `a[r]` remain as described in the initial state.
