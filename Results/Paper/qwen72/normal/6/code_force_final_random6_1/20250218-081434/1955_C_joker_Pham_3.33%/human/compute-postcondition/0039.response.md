Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) and is now `k - 2 * a[r]`, `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2, `sunks` is 0 or 1, `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`. The condition `a[r] < a[l]` is true.** 

The value of `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`, while the values of `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged. The condition `a[r] < a[l]` is still true after the update.
