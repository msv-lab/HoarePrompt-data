Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is 0.**

The variable `sunks` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
