Output State: **`l` is now `l + 1`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, if `l` equals `r` then `sunks` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `k` is now `k - a[l-1] * 2`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l-1]`, if `a[r]` was 0 then `sunks` is increased by 1 again and `r` is now `r - 1`, `sunks` is now `sunks + 1`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language: The value of `l` is incremented by 1, and it is still less than or equal to `r`. If `l` equals `r`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `a[l-1] * 2` from its current value. The value of `a[r]` is updated by subtracting `a[l-1]` from it. If `a[r]` was 0, `sunks` is increased by 1 again, and `r` is decremented by 1. The value of `sunks` is incremented by 1. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.
