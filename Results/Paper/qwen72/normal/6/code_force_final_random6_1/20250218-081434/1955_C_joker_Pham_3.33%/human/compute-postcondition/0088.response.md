Output State: **If `k` is 0, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a[l] <= a[r]` and `k >= 2 * a[l]`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l]`, `l` is 1 or 2, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2, and `sunks` is 2, 3, or 4. If `a[r]` becomes 0, `r` is updated to n - 2 or n - 3, and `sunks` is 3, 4, or 5. If `l` == `r`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k < 2 * a[l]` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, then `sunks` is 2, 3, or 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a[l] <= a[r]` and none of the above conditions are met, `sunks` is 1, 2, or 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l] > a[r]`, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.**
