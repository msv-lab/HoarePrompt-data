Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is 0. If `l` is equal to `r`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged. Additionally, the current value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a[r]`.**
