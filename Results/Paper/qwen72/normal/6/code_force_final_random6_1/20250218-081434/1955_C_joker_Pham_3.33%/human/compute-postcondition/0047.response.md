Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2, and `sunks` is 0 or 1. The condition `a[r] < a[l]` is true. `k` is less than twice the value of `a[r]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]` and `k` is greater than or equal to twice the current value of `a[l]`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[l]`, `l` is set to 1, `r` is set to n - 1 or n - 2 (if `a[r]` becomes 0), and `sunks` is set to 1. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]` and `k` is less than twice the current value of `a[l]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, then `sunks` is set to 1. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0 and `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`. If `l` is equal to `r`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.**
