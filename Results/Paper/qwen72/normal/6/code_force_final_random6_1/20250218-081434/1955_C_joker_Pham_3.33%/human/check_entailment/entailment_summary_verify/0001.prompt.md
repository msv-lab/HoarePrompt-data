You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list), `k` (a positive integer representing the reduction value), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers). It processes the elements of the list `a` by reducing their values using the reduction value `k`. The function returns the total number of elements that have been either fully processed (reduced to 0) or partially processed (reduced but not to 0) by the loop. After the function concludes, `k` is reduced to a value that is less than twice the value of the smallest remaining element in the list `a` (or 0 if all elements have been processed), and the list `a` may have some elements with reduced values, including some that may be 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the durability of each ship into a list `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the first and last ship, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships that have sunk.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`, meaning there are still ships to attack.
   - If `k` (the number of attacks left) is zero, the loop breaks, and the function returns the number of sunk ships.

4. **Single Ship Case:**
   - If `l` equals `r`, it means there is only one ship left.
   - If the remaining attacks `k` are greater than or equal to the durability of this ship, it sinks, and the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, the loop breaks without sinking the ship.

5. **Multiple Ships Case:**
   - If the durability of the first ship `a[l]` is less than or equal to the durability of the last ship `a[r]`:
     - If the remaining attacks `k` are greater than or equal to twice the durability of the first ship, the first ship is sunk, and the durability of the last ship is reduced by the durability of the first ship.
     - If the last ship's durability becomes zero, it is also sunk, and the right pointer `r` is decremented.
     - The left pointer `l` is incremented, and the number of sunk ships `sunks` is incremented.
     - If the remaining attacks `k` are exactly one less than twice the durability of the first ship, the first ship is sunk, and the loop breaks.
     - If the remaining attacks `k` are less than twice the durability of the first ship, the loop breaks.
   - If the durability of the last ship `a[r]` is less than the durability of the first ship `a[l]`:
     - If the remaining attacks `k` are greater than or equal to twice the durability of the last ship, the last ship is sunk, and the durability of the first ship is reduced by the durability of the last ship.
     - If the first ship's durability becomes zero, it is also sunk, and the left pointer `l` is incremented.
     - The right pointer `r` is decremented, and the number of sunk ships `sunks` is incremented.
     - If the remaining attacks `k` are exactly one less than twice the durability of the last ship, the last ship is sunk, and the loop breaks.
     - If the remaining attacks `k` are less than twice the durability of the last ship, the loop breaks.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where there is only one ship left correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the number of attacks `k` is zero correctly.
   - The program correctly reduces the number of attacks `k` and updates the durability of the ships.

### Correctness:
The program appears to handle the given problem correctly and follows the logic described in the problem statement. However, there are a few potential issues that need to be addressed:

- **Redundant Breaks:** The `if k == 0: break` statement is repeated multiple times, which is unnecessary and can be optimized.
- **Complexity:** The logic for handling the attacks is a bit complex and could be simplified for better readability and maintainability.

Despite these minor issues, the program should still produce the correct output for the given problem description.

### Final Verdict:
Correctness: **True**
