Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `idx` is `n + n + 5`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and an additional string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `v[x]` incremented by 1, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `n`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, and `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `x = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `x` to the integer value of the string at the index `idx` in the list `data`.
- The initial value of `x` was the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, but now it is the integer value of `data[idx]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
