### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common technique for handling multiple test cases efficiently.
   - The variable `idx` is used to keep track of the current position in the input list `data`.

2. **Test Case Loop**:
   - The program iterates over the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and then reads the exponents `a_i` for each stick.

3. **Frequency Count**:
   - The program initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` to count the frequency of each exponent `a_i`.
   - It increments the count for each exponent in the list `v`.

4. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle using the sticks.
   - It uses the fact that for a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.
   - The program checks for two cases:
     - If there are at least two sticks of the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose two sticks of that length and one stick of a different length.
     - If there are at least three sticks of the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose three sticks of that length.
   - The variable `cnt` keeps track of the cumulative count of sticks processed so far.

5. **Output**:
   - The results for each test case are stored in the list `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results, each on a new line.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
  - The combination calculation logic is correct for the given problem constraints. It correctly counts the number of valid triangles by considering the frequency of each exponent.
  - The program ensures that the order of choosing sticks does not matter by using combinations rather than permutations.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1 or 2, where no valid triangles can be formed.
  - It also handles the case where all exponents are unique, ensuring that no valid triangles are formed in such cases.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. It processes each test case in linear time relative to the number of sticks, and the space complexity is also linear.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
