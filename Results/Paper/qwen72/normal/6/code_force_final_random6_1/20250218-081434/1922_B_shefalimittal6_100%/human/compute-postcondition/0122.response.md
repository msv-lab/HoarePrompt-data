Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `idx` is `n + n + n + 4`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and an additional string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 1, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `v[x]` incremented by `n`, `cnt` is 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to it.
- `cnt` is 2, `i` is 2, and `v[i]` is the value at index `i` in the list `v`.
- The expression `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` calculates the new value to be added to `ans`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
