Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `idx` is `n + n + 5`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and an additional string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `n`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, and `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, so `idx` is now `n + n + 5`.
- All other variables (`t`, `data`, `results`, `n`, `v`, `cnt`, `i`, `x`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `x` is still the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, which is now `data[n + n + 4]`.
