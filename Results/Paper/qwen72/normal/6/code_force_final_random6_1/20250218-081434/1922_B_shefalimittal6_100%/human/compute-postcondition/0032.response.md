Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `cnt` is incremented by the value of `v[i]`.
- The initial value of `v[i]` is 0 because `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- Therefore, `cnt` becomes `cnt + 0`, which simplifies to `cnt` remaining the same as its initial value.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
