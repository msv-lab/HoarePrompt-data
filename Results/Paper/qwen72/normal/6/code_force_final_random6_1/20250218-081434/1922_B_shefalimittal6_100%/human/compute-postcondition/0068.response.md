Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + n + 3`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with each element at index `x` incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `data[n+3:n+n+3]`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, and the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to it.
- Since `cnt` is 0, the expression `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` evaluates to 0.
- Therefore, `ans` remains 0 after the execution of the code.
- All other variables (`t`, `idx`, `data`, `results`, `n`, `v`, `i`, `x`) retain their initial values and conditions.
