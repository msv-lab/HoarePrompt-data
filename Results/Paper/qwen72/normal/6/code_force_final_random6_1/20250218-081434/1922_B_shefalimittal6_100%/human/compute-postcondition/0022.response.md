Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings, each string being a part of the input data split by spaces, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each `v[x]` is incremented by the number of times the corresponding integer `x` appears in `data` from index 2 to `n + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`idx`**: After `n` iterations, `idx` will be `n + 2` because it starts at 2 and is incremented by 1 for each iteration.
- **`data`**: The list `data` remains unchanged because it is only read from, not modified.
- **`results`**: The list `results` remains empty because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is only used to determine the number of iterations.
- **`v`**: The list `v` is modified within the loop. Each element `v[x]` is incremented by 1 each time the corresponding integer `x` (from `data[idx]`) is encountered. After `n` iterations, `v` will reflect the count of each integer `x` in the range from `data[2]` to `data[n + 1]`.
