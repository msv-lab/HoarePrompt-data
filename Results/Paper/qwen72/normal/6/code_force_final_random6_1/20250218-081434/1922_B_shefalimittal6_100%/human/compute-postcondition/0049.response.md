Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 3`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `n` is `int(data[n + 2])`, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each `v[x]` is incremented by the number of times the corresponding integer `x` appears in `data` from index 2 to `n + 1`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the total number of pairs and triplets of indices where the values in `data` are the same, calculated based on the counts in `v`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `n + 3`.
- All other variables (`t`, `data`, `results`, `n`, `v`, `cnt`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
