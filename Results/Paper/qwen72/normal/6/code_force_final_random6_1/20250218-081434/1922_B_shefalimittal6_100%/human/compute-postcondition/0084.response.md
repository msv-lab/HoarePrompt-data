Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + n + 3`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with each element at index `x` incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `data[n+3:n+n+3]`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[1] + v[i]`, `i` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
