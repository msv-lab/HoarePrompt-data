Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + n + 3`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with each element at index `x` incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `data[n+3:n+n+3]`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`.**

The code snippet `ans = 0` resets the value of `ans` to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `ans` was previously the total number of pairs and triplets of indices where the values in `data` are the same, but now it is explicitly set to 0.
