Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 4, `data` is a list of strings, each string being a part of the input data split by spaces, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where `v[x]` is now 2, `x` is the integer value of the string at `data[3]`.**

Explanation: The code `v[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `v` by 1. Initially, `v[x]` was 1, so after the increment, `v[x]` is now 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
