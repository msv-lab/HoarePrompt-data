You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through this list to parse the number of test cases `t` and the values for each test case.
   - This approach is efficient for large inputs, as it avoids multiple calls to `input()`.

2. **Test Case Loop:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and initializes a list `v` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It then reads the stick lengths `a_i` and increments the corresponding index in `v`.

3. **Counting Valid Triangles:**
   - The program uses a variable `cnt` to keep track of the cumulative count of sticks.
   - It iterates through the list `v` to count the number of valid triangles:
     - If there are at least 2 sticks of the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from these and pairs them with any of the previously counted sticks.
     - If there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from these.
   - The formula used to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from `v[i]` is `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.
   - The formula used to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from `v[i]` is `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.

4. **Output:**
   - The results for each test case are stored in a list `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, the results are printed, each on a new line.

### Analysis:

- **Triangle Inequality Theorem:**
  - For three sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick.
  - Given the stick lengths are powers of 2, the only way to form a triangle is if all three sticks have the same length. This is because the sum of two smaller powers of 2 will never be greater than the next higher power of 2.

- **Correctness of the Logic:**
  - The program correctly identifies that the only way to form a triangle is if there are at least 2 sticks of the same length.
  - It counts the number of ways to choose 2 or 3 sticks of the same length, which is the correct approach given the constraints.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where there are fewer than 3 sticks correctly by outputting 0.
  - It also handles the case where there are multiple sticks of the same length and calculates the combinations correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem description accurately. It correctly counts the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle with the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
