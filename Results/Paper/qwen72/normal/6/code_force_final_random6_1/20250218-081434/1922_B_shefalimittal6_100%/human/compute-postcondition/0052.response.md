Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 3`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v` (which is 0), `i` is `n`, `ans` is the total number of pairs and triplets of indices where the values in `data` are the same, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx]`**

Explanation:
- The code `x = int(data[idx])` converts the string at the index `idx` in the list `data` to an integer and assigns it to `x`.
- `idx` is `n + 3`, so `x` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `idx`, `data`, `results`, `n`, `v`, `cnt`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
