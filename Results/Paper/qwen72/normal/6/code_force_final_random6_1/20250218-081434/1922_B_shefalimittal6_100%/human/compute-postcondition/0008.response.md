Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 2, `data` is a list of strings, each string being a part of the input data split by spaces, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.** 

The value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
