Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are input strings, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus 1 if the characters at index `i` in `s1` and `s2` are '1' and '0' respectively; otherwise, `res` remains the absolute value of `a1 - a2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 2` if `hd` was initially `a1 - a2 - 1` and `hd` > 0, otherwise `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1` if `hd` was initially `a1 - a2`, `i` is `i + 1` and `n` must be greater than `i`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.**
