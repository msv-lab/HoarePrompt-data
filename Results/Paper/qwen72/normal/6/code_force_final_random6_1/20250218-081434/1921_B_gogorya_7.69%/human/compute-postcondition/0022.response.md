Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are input strings, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`. If the characters at index `i` in `s1` and `s2` are '1' and '0' respectively, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus 1, and `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 2` if it was initially `a1 - a2 - 1` and `hd` > 0, otherwise `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` if it was initially `a1 - a2` and `hd` > 0. In all other cases, `res` remains the absolute value of `a1 - a2`, and `hd` remains `a1 - a2` if `hd` <= 0. In both cases, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i`.***
