Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s1` is an input string, `s2` is an input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`, `i` is 0, and `hd` is greater than -1. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**
