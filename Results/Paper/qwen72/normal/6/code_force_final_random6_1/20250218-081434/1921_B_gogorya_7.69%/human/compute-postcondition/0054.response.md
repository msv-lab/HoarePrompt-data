The value of `hd` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, so their states are still valid.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s1` is a new input string, `s2` is an updated input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 2, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`, and `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1` or `a1 - a2 - 2` depending on the initial value of `hd`.**
