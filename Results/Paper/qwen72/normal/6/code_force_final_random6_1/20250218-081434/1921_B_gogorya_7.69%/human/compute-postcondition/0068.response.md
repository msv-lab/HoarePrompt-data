Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s1` is a new input string, `s2` is a new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is `n - 1`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated to the absolute value of the difference between `a1` and `a2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `i`, and `hd`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
