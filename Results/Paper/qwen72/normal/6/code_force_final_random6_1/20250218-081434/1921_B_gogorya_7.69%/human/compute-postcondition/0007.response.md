Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is an input string, `s2` is an input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2`.**

The variable `hd` is assigned the value of the difference between `a1` and `a2`, where `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1` and `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
