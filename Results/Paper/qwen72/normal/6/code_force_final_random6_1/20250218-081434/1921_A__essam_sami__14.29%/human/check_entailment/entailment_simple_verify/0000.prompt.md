You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of a corner of the square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and there is exactly one square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area for each test case. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 100.

    #State: `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 100, `steps` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are the last set of input integers for the final iteration, `n` is equal to \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\), and `x` is equal to \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\). If `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the area of the square is flawed. The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and then prints the smaller of the two values. However, this approach does not guarantee that the correct side length of the square is being used to calculate the area.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
0 0
0 2
2 0
2 2
```
The correct area of the square is 4 (since the side length is 2). However, the program will calculate:
- `n = (0 - 2) * (0 - 2) + (0 - 0) * (0 - 0) = 4`
- `x = (0 - 2) * (0 - 2) + (2 - 2) * (2 - 2) = 4`

Since both `n` and `x` are equal, the program will print 4, which is correct in this case. However, this logic is not robust and can fail in other cases.

Consider another input:
```
1
1 1
1 3
3 1
3 3
```
The correct area of the square is 4 (since the side length is 2). However, the program will calculate:
- `n = (1 - 3) * (1 - 3) + (1 - 1) * (1 - 1) = 4`
- `x = (1 - 3) * (1 - 3) + (3 - 3) * (3 - 3) = 4`

Again, both `n` and `x` are equal, and the program will print 4, which is correct. However, this is not a general solution.

A more robust approach would involve identifying the side length of the square by finding the minimum distance between any two points that are either aligned vertically or horizontally. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_square_area():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Sort points to ensure they are in a consistent order
        points.sort()
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = points[1][0] - points[0][0]
        
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length * side_length
        print(area)

find_square_area()
```

This corrected version ensures that the side length is correctly identified and the area is calculated accurately for all test cases.
