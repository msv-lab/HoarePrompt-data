Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) â€” the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of a corner of the square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and there is exactly one square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area for each test case. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        e, f = map(int, input().split())
        
        g, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        
        x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
        
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 100, `steps` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are the last set of input integers for the final iteration, `n` is equal to \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\), and `x` is equal to \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\). If `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases from user input, where each test case consists of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates two distances: `n` between the first and third points, and `x` between the second and fourth points. It then prints the smaller of these two distances for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being an integer between 1 and 100, `steps` being `t-1`, and the last set of input coordinates being stored in `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h`. The final state includes the printed results for each test case.
