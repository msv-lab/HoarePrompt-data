Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least one character, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, and `i` is 0. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus 1, `n` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `m` is the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `a[0]` is now `m`, and `b[0]` is now `n`. If `i` is greater than or equal to half the length of `a`, `n` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` (as characters), `m` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` (as characters), `a[i]` is now equal to `n`, and `b[i]` is now equal to `m`.***
