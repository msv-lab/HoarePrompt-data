Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This indicates the number of test cases.
- `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that \(1 \leq x, y < 10^{100}\), and they consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least two characters.
- `b` is a list of characters from a new input string.
- `i` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the element at index `i` of the list `a`.
- The `end` parameter is set to an empty string, which means that the output will not be followed by a newline character, but will be printed on the same line.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `i` is 1, the code will print the second element of the list `a`.
- The list `a` is described as a list of characters from an input string that must have at least two characters. Therefore, `a[1]` will be the second character of the input string.

### Final Output:
Output: **[second character of the input string]**

This means that the second character of the input string will be printed without a newline character.
