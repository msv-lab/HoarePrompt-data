Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This indicates the number of test cases.
   - `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that \(1 \leq x, y < 10^{100}\), and they consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
   - `a` is a list of characters from the input string.
   - `b` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is `len(a)`, which means `i` is the length of the list `a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(b[i], end='')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `i` is the length of the list `a`.
   - The `print` statement is trying to access the element at index `i` in the list `b`.
   - Since `i` is the length of `a`, it is the number of elements in `a`.
   - The list `b` must have at least 2 elements, but the exact length of `b` is not specified.
   - If `i` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, accessing `b[i]` will result in an `IndexError` because the index is out of bounds.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that `i` is the length of `a` and `b` must have at least 2 elements, the code will only print the value of `b[i]` if `i` is less than the length of `b`.
   - If `i` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, the code will raise an `IndexError`.

Since the exact length of `b` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `b[i]` without more information. However, we can describe the potential outcomes based on the given conditions.

Output: **b[i] (where i is the length of list `a` and `b` is a list of characters with at least 2 elements, and this will only print if i is less than the length of `b`; otherwise, it will raise an IndexError)**
