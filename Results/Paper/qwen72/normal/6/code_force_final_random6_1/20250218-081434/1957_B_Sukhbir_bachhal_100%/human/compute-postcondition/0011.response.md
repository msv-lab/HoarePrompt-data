Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 25000, and `n` is not equal to 0; `position` is 2**

The value of `n` is right-shifted by 1 bit, which effectively divides `n` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest integer. Since `n` was initially a positive integer between 1 and 50000, after the right shift, `n` will be a positive integer between 1 and 25000. The value of `position` remains unchanged.
