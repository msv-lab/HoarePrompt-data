Precondition: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should take two parameters, `n` and `k`, as described in the problem. Here is the correct function definition and its precondition:

Function definition:
```
def construct_sequence(n, k):
```

Precondition: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.**
