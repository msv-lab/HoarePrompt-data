### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Single Element Case (`n == 1`):**
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `k` as the only element in the sequence.
   - This is correct because the sum of the sequence is `k`, and the number of 1s in the binary representation of `k` is maximized by itself.

3. **Multiple Elements Case (`n > 1`):**
   - The program calls `func_1(k)` to determine the highest bit position in the binary representation of `k`.
   - It then appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the array `arr`, where `counter` is the highest bit position.
   - The next element appended to `arr` is `k - arr[-1]`, which ensures the sum of the sequence is `k`.
   - The remaining elements in the sequence are set to 0.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` calculates the highest bit position in the binary representation of `n`.
   - It initializes `position` to 0 and shifts `n` right until `n` becomes 0, incrementing `position` each time.
   - The function returns `position - 1`, which is the highest bit position (0-indexed).

5. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - By setting the first element to `2 ** counter - 1`, we ensure that the highest bit position is set to 1, and all lower bits are also set to 1.
   - The second element is set to `k - arr[-1]`, which ensures the sum of the sequence is `k`.
   - The remaining elements are set to 0, which does not affect the bitwise OR operation.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is greater than 1 by ensuring the sum is `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
