Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a list representing the segment of `arr` with the highest sum. This segment is identified from a list of potential segments (`segments_variants`) that are built during the function's execution. The returned list contains the sum of the segment and the start and end indices of the segment in `arr`. If no valid segment (with more than one element) is found, the function returns `[-1]`. **
