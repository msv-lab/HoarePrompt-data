Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function correctly computes the remainder of a number when divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It is used to ensure that the final answer is within the required modulo constraints.
   - The function is correctly implemented and does not have any issues.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function aims to find the segment with the highest sum in the array.
   - However, the logic in `func_2` is flawed:
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers.
     - The function does not correctly identify the maximum sum of a subarray.
     - The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` even when they are not valid segments (e.g., `new_segment` is an empty list).
     - The function returns `[-1]` if no valid segment is found, which is not the correct behavior for the problem.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program is to use the result of `func_2` to compute the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.
   - The formula used to compute the answer is:
     ```python
     answer = max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]
     ```
   - This formula assumes that `max_segment[0]` is the maximum sum of any subarray, which is not guaranteed by the current implementation of `func_2`.
   - The program also does not handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers correctly.

4. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the test case:
     ```
     Input:
     1
     3 3
     2 2 8
     ```
   - The expected output is `96`, but the program will not produce this output because `func_2` does not correctly identify the maximum sum of a subarray.
   - The program will likely return an incorrect value or fail due to the flawed logic in `func_2`.

5. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - The function `func_3` is not used in the main logic and is not implemented.
   - This function is a placeholder and does not contribute to the solution.

Given the issues with `func_2` and the incomplete implementation of `func_3`, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
