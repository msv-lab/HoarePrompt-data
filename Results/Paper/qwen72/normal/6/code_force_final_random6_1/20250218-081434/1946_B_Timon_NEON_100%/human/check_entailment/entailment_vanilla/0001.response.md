### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers and we need to perform `k` operations.
   - In each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations, and the result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1:** This function takes a number and returns it modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is correct and necessary for the problem.
   - **func_2:** This function is supposed to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices. However, there are several issues:
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array is entirely negative.
     - The function does not correctly update `max_segment` and `new_segment` in all scenarios.
     - The function does not correctly append the last segment if it is positive.
     - The function returns a segment with a negative sum if no positive segment is found, which is incorrect.
   - **func_3:** This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operations. It is supposed to compute the final answer but is not implemented.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The key insight is that the maximum sum of the array after `k` operations can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is positive, we can add it `k` times to the array.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is zero or negative, the best strategy is to add zero `k` times, which does not change the sum of the array.

4. **Kadane's Algorithm:**
   - To find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, we can use Kadane's algorithm, which efficiently computes this in \(O(n)\) time.
   - Once we have the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, we can compute the final sum as `max_sum * (k + 1) + initial_sum` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Implementation:**
   - The provided `func_2` is not correctly implementing Kadane's algorithm.
   - The provided `func_3` is incomplete and does not compute the final answer.
