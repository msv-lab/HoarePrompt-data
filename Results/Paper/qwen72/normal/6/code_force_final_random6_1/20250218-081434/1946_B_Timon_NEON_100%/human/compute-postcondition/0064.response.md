The only objects in the loop head are `segment` and `segments_variants`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `segments_variants`. If `segments_variants` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum encountered during the loop, `new_segment` is either an empty list or the segment that is currently being built, and `segments_variants` must contain at least one element. The variable `segment` is the next element in `segments_variants`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `segments_variants` must have at least one more element, and `segment` will be the next element in `segments_variants`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr)`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum encountered during the loop, `new_segment` is either an empty list or the segment that is currently being built, `segments_variants` is a list of segments that were considered as potential max segments but were discarded because a higher sum segment was found, and it must contain at least two elements, `segment` is the second element in `segments_variants`.**
