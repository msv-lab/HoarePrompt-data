Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and the first element of `new_segment` is now `new_segment[0] + arr[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` updates the first element of `new_segment` by adding the first element of `arr` to it.
- Since `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is `arr[0]`.
- Therefore, `new_segment[0]` is now `new_segment[0] + arr[0]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
