Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr). `i` is len(arr) - 1. `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum encountered during the loop, and it contains the sum of the segment and the starting index of the segment. `new_segment` is either an empty list or the segment that is currently being built, containing the sum of the segment and the starting index of the segment. `segments_variants` is a list of segments that were considered as potential max segments but were discarded because a higher sum segment was found. `max_sum` remains -1.**

In natural language, after the loop has completed all iterations:
- The variable `i` will be equal to the last index of the list `arr` (i.e., `len(arr) - 1`).
- `max_segment` will contain the sum of the segment with the highest sum found during the loop and the starting index of that segment.
- `new_segment` will either be an empty list if no new segment is being built, or it will contain the sum of the current segment being built and the starting index of that segment.
- `segments_variants` will be a list of segments that were considered as potential max segments but were discarded because a higher sum segment was found.
- The variable `max_sum` will remain unchanged at -1.
