Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0], `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is [arr[1], 1], `segments_variants` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers with the given constraints and has at least 2 elements.
- `i` is initially 1.
- `max_segment` is initially set to `[arr[0], 0]`.
- `max_sum` is initially -1.
- `new_segment` is initially set to `[arr[i], i]`, which translates to `[arr[1], 1]` because `i` is 1.
- `segments_variants` is initially an empty list and remains unchanged by the code snippet.
