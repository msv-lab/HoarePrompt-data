Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 3 elements. `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[2]` is non-negative, `new_segment` is [arr[2], 2]. If `arr[1]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0, 0]. If `arr[1]` is not less than 0, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], and `segments_variants` is either [[0, 0, -1]] or an empty list. If `new_segment` was initially empty and `arr[1]` is non-negative, `segments_variants` is an empty list. If `new_segment` was initially empty and `arr[1]` is negative, `segments_variants` remains an empty list.**
