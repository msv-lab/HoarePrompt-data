### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1:** This function correctly returns the remainder of a number when divided by \(10^9 + 7\). It is used to ensure the final answer is within the required range.
   
   - **func_2:** This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices. However, there are several issues:
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array is entirely negative.
     - The function does not correctly update `max_segment` and `new_segment` in all scenarios.
     - The function does not correctly append the last segment if it is positive.
     - The function returns a segment with a negative sum if no positive segment is found, which is incorrect.
     - The function appends `new_segment` and `max_segment` to `segments_variants` even if they are empty or invalid, leading to potential incorrect results.
   
   - **func_3:** This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operations. It is supposed to compute the final answer but is not implemented.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The key insight is that the maximum sum of the array after `k` operations can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is positive, we can add it `k` times to the array.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is zero or negative, the best strategy is to add zero `k` times, which does not change the sum of the array.
   - To find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, we can use Kadane's algorithm, which efficiently computes this in \(O(n)\) time.
   - Once we have the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, we can compute the final sum as `max_sum * (k + 1) + initial_sum` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Kadane's Algorithm:**
   - Kadane's algorithm is a dynamic programming approach that finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in linear time.
   - It maintains a running sum and updates the maximum sum found so far.

5. **Implementation:**
   - The provided `func_2` is not correctly implementing Kadane's algorithm.
   - The provided `func_3` is incomplete and does not compute the final answer.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **func_1:** The function is correct and necessary for the problem.
  - **State Before Call:** `number` is an integer.
  - **State After Call:** The function returns the remainder of `number` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

- **func_2:** The function has multiple issues:
  - **State Before Call:** `arr` is a list of integers where \(-10^9 \le arr[i] \le 10^9\) for all \(0 \le i < len(arr)\).
  - **State After Call:** The function returns a segment with the highest sum from `segments_variants` that has more than one element, or `[-1]` if no such segment exists.
  - **Issues:**
    - The function does not handle the case where the array is entirely negative correctly.
    - The function does not update `max_segment` and `new_segment` in all scenarios.
    - The function appends `new_segment` and `max_segment` to `segments_variants` even if they are empty or invalid.
    - The function returns a segment with a negative sum if no positive segment is found, which is incorrect.

- **func_3:** The function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operations:
  - **State Before Call:** `number` is an integer, and `quantity` is a non-negative integer.
  - **State After Call:** The function initializes `answer` to 0 and does not modify it or return any value.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the issues in `func_2` and the incomplete nature of `func_3`, the program is incorrect. The original assessment is accurate in identifying these problems.

Final: **False**
