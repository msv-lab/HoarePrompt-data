Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0], `max_sum` is -1, `segments_variants` contains one element which is `new_segment` + [0].**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers with the given constraints, and it must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 1.
- `max_segment` is initially set to `[arr[0], 0]`.
- `max_sum` is -1.
- The code snippet `segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])` appends the list `new_segment` with the value `i - 1` (which is 0) to `segments_variants`.
- Therefore, `segments_variants` now contains one element which is `new_segment` + [0].
- The values of `arr`, `i`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged.
