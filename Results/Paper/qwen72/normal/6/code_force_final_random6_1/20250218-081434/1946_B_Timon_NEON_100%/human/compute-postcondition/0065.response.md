Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr)`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum encountered during the loop, `new_segment` is either an empty list or the segment that is currently being built, `segments_variants` is a list of segments that were considered as potential max segments but were discarded because a higher sum segment was found, and it must contain at least two elements, `segment` is the second element in `segments_variants`, `total_max_segment` is the second element in `segments_variants`.**

The code assigns the value of `segment` (which is the second element in `segments_variants`) to `total_max_segment`. The other variables remain unchanged.
