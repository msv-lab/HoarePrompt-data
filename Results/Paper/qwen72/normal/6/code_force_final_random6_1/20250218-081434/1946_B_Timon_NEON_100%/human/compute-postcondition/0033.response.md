Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], and `segments_variants` is either [[0, 0, -1]] or an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` updates the first element of `new_segment` by adding `arr[i]` to it.
- Initially, `new_segment` is either `[arr[0], 0]` or an empty list. Since `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is `arr[1]`.
- If `new_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]`, then `new_segment[0]` becomes `arr[0] + arr[1]`.
- The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and `segments_variants`) remain unchanged.
