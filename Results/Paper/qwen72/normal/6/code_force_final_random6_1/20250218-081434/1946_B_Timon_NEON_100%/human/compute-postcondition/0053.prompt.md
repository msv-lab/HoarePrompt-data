Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if new_segment:
        if arr[i] < 0:
            if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
            else:
                segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                max_segment = new_segment
            new_segment = []
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            new_segment[0] += arr[i]
    else:
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            new_segment = [arr[i], i]
        max_segment[0] += arr[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0], and `max_sum` is -1. If `new_segment` is non-empty, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i]` if `arr[i]` is less than 0, and if `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, then `segments_variants` contains one element which is [0, 0, -1]. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to be equal to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` contains one element which is `new_segment` + [i - 1]. If `arr[i]` is not less than 0, the first element of `new_segment` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[0]`, and `segments_variants` remains an empty list. If `new_segment` is empty, `new_segment` is set to [arr[0], 0] if `arr[0]` is non-negative, otherwise, `new_segment` remains an empty list and `segments_variants` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements. `i` is 1, and `max_sum` is -1. If `new_segment` is non-empty: If `arr[1]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is updated to [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0, 0]. If `arr[1]` is not less than 0, `max_segment` is updated to [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], `new_segment` is updated to [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], and `segments_variants` is either [[0, 0, -1]] or an empty list. If `new_segment` is empty: If `arr[1]` is non-negative, `new_segment` is set to [arr[1], 1], and `segments_variants` is an empty list. If `arr[1]` is negative, `new_segment` remains an empty list, and `segments_variants` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 3 elements. `i` is 2, and `max_sum` is -1. If `new_segment` is non-empty: If `arr[2]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], and `segments_variants` is either an empty list or [[arr[0] + arr[1], 0, 1]]. If `arr[2]` is not less than 0 and `new_segment` is non-empty: If `arr[1]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0, 0]. If `arr[1]` is not less than 0, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], `new_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], and `segments_variants` is either [[0, 0, -1]] or an empty list. If `new_segment` is empty: If `arr[2]` is non-negative, `new_segment` is [arr[2], 2]. If `arr[1]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0, 0]. If `arr[1]` is not less than 0, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], and `segments_variants` is either [[0, 0, -1]] or an empty list. If `new_segment` was initially empty and `arr[1]` is non-negative, `segments_variants` is an empty list. If `new_segment` was initially empty and `arr[1]` is negative, `segments_variants` remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
