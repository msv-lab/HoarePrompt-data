Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0. Additionally, `max_segment[0]` is less than or equal to `new_segment[0]`.**
