Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 3 elements. `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1. `new_segment` is either [arr[0] + arr[1], 0] or [arr[1], 1]. `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is either [arr[0] + arr[1], 0, 1] or [arr[1], 1, 1]. `max_segment` is now equal to `new_segment`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`. Since `new_segment` can be either `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]` or `[arr[1], 1]`, `max_segment` will also be one of these two values. The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, and `segments_variants`) remain unchanged.
