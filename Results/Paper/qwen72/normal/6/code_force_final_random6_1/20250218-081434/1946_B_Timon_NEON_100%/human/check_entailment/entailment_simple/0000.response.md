### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Loop Structure:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the array `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes an integer `number` and returns the result of `number % 1000000007`.
   - This is correct for the problem's requirement to output the answer modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in `arr`.
   - The function initializes `max_segment` and `new_segment` to track the current and maximum segments.
   - It iterates through the array, updating `new_segment` and `max_segment` based on the values encountered.
   - However, there are several issues:
     - `new_segment` and `max_segment` are initialized as lists, but they are treated as if they were integers in the loop.
     - The condition `if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` is incorrect because `new_segment` is initially an empty list, and accessing `new_segment[0]` will raise an error.
     - The logic for appending segments to `segments_variants` is flawed, and the final check for `total_max_segment` is also incorrect.
     - The function should return the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray, but it returns a segment with more than one element, which is not necessary for the problem.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic calculates the answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - This formula is incorrect because it assumes that the maximum segment sum can be doubled `k` times, which is not always the case.
   - The correct approach should be to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray and then use this sum to calculate the final result after `k` operations.

5. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function is not used in the program and is incomplete.
   - It does not affect the correctness of the program, but it is unnecessary.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the issues in `func_2` and the main logic. The function `func_2` does not correctly find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray, and the main logic incorrectly calculates the final result.

**Correctness: False**
