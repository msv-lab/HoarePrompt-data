Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr). `i` is len(arr) - 1. `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum encountered during the loop, and it contains the sum of the segment and the starting index of the segment. `new_segment` is either an empty list or the segment that is currently being built, containing the sum of the segment and the starting index of the segment. `segments_variants` is a list of segments that were considered as potential max segments but were discarded because a higher sum segment was found. The last element of `segments_variants` is now `new_segment` appended with the value `len(arr) - 1`. `max_sum` remains -1. `total_max_segment` is [-1].**

The code snippet initializes `total_max_segment` to `[-1]`. This does not affect the other variables, so their states remain as described in the initial state. The value of `total_max_segment` is now a list containing a single element, `-1`.
