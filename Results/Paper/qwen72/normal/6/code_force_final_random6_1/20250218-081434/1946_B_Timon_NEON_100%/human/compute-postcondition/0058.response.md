Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr)`, `i` is len(arr) - 1, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum encountered during the loop, and it contains the sum of the segment and the starting index of the segment, `new_segment` is either an empty list or the segment that is currently being built, containing the sum of the segment and the starting index of the segment, `segments_variants` is a list of segments that were considered as potential max segments but were discarded because a higher sum segment was found, and it must contain at least one element, `max_sum` remains -1, `total_max_segment` is [-1], `segment` is the first element in `segments_variants`, and the sum of `segment` is greater than the sum of `total_max_segment`, and `segment` has more than one element.**
