Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0], `max_sum` is -1, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [arr[0], 0, 0].**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0], and `max_sum` is -1.
- The code snippet `segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])` appends a new element to `segments_variants`.
- `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0], and `i` is 1, so `i - 1` is 0.
- Therefore, `max_segment + [i - 1]` is [arr[0], 0, 0].
- `segments_variants` now contains one element, which is [arr[0], 0, 0].
- The values of `arr`, `i`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged.
