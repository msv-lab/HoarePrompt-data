Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`. If `temp[1]` is greater than `max`, `max` is updated to the value of `temp[1]`. Otherwise, `max` retains its previous value.***
