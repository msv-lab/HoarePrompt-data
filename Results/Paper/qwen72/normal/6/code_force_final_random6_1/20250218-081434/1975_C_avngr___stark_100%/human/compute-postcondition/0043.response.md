Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`, `max` is equal to `temp[1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value of `temp[1]` to `max`. Since `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`, the value of `temp[1]` is the second smallest element in this list. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `temp`) remain unchanged.
