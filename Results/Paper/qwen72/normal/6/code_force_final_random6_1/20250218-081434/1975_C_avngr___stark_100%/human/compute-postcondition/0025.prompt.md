Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `n` is 2, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. `max` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2):
    temp = a[i:i + 3]
    temp.sort()
    if temp[1] > max:
        max = temp[1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0, `temp` is a sorted list containing the first three elements of `a`. If the second element of `temp` is greater than the initial value of `max`, then `max` is updated to this second element. Otherwise, `max` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`. If `temp[1]` is greater than `max`, `max` is updated to the value of `temp[1]`. Otherwise, `max` retains its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]`. If the second smallest element in `temp` is greater than `max`, `max` is updated to this second smallest element. Otherwise, `max` retains its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
