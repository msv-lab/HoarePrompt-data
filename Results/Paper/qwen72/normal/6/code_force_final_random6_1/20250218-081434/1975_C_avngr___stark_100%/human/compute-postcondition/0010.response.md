Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `max` is 0, `i` is 0, `temp` is a list containing the first three elements of `a`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` creates a new list `temp` that contains the first three elements of the list `a`, starting from index `i` (which is 0). The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `max`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
