The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1. The condition for the loop to continue is that `n - 2` must be greater than `i`, which means `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `temp` is a list containing the first three elements of `a` in sorted ascending order. If `temp[1]` > `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`. Otherwise, `max` remains 0.**
