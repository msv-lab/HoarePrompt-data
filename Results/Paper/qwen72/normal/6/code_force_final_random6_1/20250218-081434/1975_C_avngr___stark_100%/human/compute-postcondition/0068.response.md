Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` in ascending order, `max` is equal to `temp[1]`.** 

The value of `max` is updated to the second element of the sorted list `temp`, which contains the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged.
