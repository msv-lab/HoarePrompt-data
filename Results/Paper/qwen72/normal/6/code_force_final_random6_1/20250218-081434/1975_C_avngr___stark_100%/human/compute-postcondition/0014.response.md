Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0, `temp` is a sorted list containing the first three elements of `a`. If the second element of `temp` is greater than the initial value of `max`, then `max` is updated to this second element. Otherwise, `max` remains 0.***
