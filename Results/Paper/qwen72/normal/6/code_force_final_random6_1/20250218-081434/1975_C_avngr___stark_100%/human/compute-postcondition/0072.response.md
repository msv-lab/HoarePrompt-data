Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]` in ascending order. If `temp[1]` > `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`. Otherwise, `max` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The `temp.sort()` method sorts the list `temp` in ascending order.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The list `temp` is now sorted, but the specific values of `temp` depend on the initial values of `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]`.
- The condition `if temp[1] > max` will be evaluated based on the sorted `temp` list, and `max` will be updated accordingly. However, since the initial value of `max` is not specified, it remains 0 unless the condition is met.
