Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n-3`, `max` is the maximum value of the second smallest element in any consecutive sub-list of 3 elements in `a`. If `n` == 2, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statements in the loop.***
