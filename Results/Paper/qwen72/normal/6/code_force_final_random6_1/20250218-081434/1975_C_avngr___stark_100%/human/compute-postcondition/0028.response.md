Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n-3`, `max` is the maximum value of the second smallest element in any consecutive sub-list of 3 elements in `a`.**

The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and retains the initial state of the other variables.
