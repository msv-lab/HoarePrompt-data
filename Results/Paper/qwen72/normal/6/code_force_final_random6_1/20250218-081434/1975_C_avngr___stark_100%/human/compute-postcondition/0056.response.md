Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-3` if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `max` is the maximum value among the middle elements of all possible sorted sublists of length 3 from `a`, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. The values of `n`, `i`, `max`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged.
