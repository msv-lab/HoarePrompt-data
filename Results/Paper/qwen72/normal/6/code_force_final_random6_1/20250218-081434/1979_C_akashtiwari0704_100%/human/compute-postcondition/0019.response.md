Output State: **`bets` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is increased by `prod // a[0]`**

Explanation: The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` updates the variable `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to it. Since `i` is 0, `a[0]` is accessed. According to the initial state, `a[0]` has been updated to `prod // a[0]`. Therefore, `sumo` is increased by the value of `prod // a[0]`. The values of `bets` and `i` remain unchanged.
