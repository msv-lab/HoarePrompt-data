Output State: **`i` is `bets - 1`, `bets` is the same as the initial `bets`, `ans` is updated to include the string representation of each element in the list `a` followed by a space.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `bets - 1`, which is the last index of the list `a`.
- The variable `bets` will remain the same as it was initially, because it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `ans` will contain the string representation of each element in the list `a`, with each element followed by a space. This means that `ans` will be a string where all the integers in `a` are concatenated together, separated by spaces.
