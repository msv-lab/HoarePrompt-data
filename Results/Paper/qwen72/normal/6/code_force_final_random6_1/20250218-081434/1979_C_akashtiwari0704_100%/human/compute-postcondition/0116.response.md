Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `bets` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `i` is `bets - 1`.
- `ans` is a string containing the space-separated string representations of all integers in the list `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`bets`**: This is an integer input that is greater than 0. For example, `bets` could be 5.
2. **`i`**: This is calculated as `bets - 1`. If `bets` is 5, then `i` would be 4.
3. **`ans`**: This is a string that contains the space-separated string representations of all integers in the list `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]`. This means that `ans` will include the elements from `a[0]` to `a[i]`.

### Example:
- Suppose `bets` is 5.
- Then `i` would be `5 - 1 = 4`.
- `ans` would be a string containing the elements from `a[0]` to `a[4]` separated by spaces. If `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `ans` would be `"1 2 3 4 5"`.

### General Case:
- If `bets` is any integer \( n \) greater than 0, then `i` will be \( n - 1 \).
- `ans` will be a string containing the elements from `a[0]` to `a[n-1]` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the string `ans`, which contains the space-separated string representations of all integers in the list `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]`.

Output: **"a[0] a[1] ... a[bets - 1]" (where each element is the string representation of the corresponding integer in the list `a` from index 0 to index `bets - 1`)**
