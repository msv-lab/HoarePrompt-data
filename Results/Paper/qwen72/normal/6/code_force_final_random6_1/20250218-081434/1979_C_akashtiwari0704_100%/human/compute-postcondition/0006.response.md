Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`, `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor function. The values of `t`, `T`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new value of `g` is the result of multiplying the old value of `g` by the second element of the list `l`, and then dividing that product by the greatest common divisor of the old `g` and the second element of `l`.
