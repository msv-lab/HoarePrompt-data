Output State: **`bets` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is increased by `prod // a[0]`, `a[1]` is updated to `prod // a[1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`. Since `i` is 1, `a[1]` is updated to `prod // a[1]`.
- The values of `bets`, `i`, `a[0]`, and `sumo` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- `a[0]` is still updated to `prod // a[0]`, and `sumo` is still increased by `prod // a[0]`.
