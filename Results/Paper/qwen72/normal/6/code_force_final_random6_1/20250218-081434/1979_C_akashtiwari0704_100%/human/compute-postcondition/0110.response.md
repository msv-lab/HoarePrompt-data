The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of the element at index `0` of the list `a` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. The variable `ans` must have been initialized before this line of code, and the list `a` must contain at least one element. The value of `i` is `0`, so the first element of `a` is used. The values of `bets` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is updated to include the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space.**
