Output State: **`bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated string representations of all integers in the list `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `bets` remains the same as the initial input integer greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is now equal to `bets - 1`, which is the last index of the list `a`.
- The variable `ans` is a string that contains the string representations of all the integers in the list `a`, separated by spaces, from the first element `a[0]` to the last element `a[bets - 1]`.
