Postcondition: ***`l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `o` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string and sorted in descending order, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `a` and converting each part to an integer, `n` is the first integer in the list `b`, `f` is the second integer in the list `b`, `k` is the third integer in the list `b` minus the count of the first element in `l` in the list `o`, `fav` is the string at index `f - 1` in the list `o`, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a string from the list `o` and each value is the count of how many times that string appears in the list `o`, `t` must be greater than `len(l)`, and `fav` is not equal to the first element of `l`. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
