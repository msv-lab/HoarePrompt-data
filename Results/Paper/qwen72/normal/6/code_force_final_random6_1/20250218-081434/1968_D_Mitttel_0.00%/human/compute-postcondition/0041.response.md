Output State: **`input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`, `index` is now 13 + `5 * n` + `n`, `t` must be greater than 1, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the new `result`, `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]` and now also the integer value of the string at `data[5 + 2 * n]` and `data[index - 4]`, `k` is now the integer value of the string at `data[index - 3]`, `PB` is now the integer value of the string at `data[index - 2]`, `PS` is now the integer value of the string at `data[index - 1]`, `p` is now a list of integers from the strings at `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is now a list of integers from the strings at `data[index:index + n]`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.**

Explanation:
- The code `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`.
- `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.
- The other variables (`input`, `data`, `index`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`) remain unchanged.
- The final state of `results` is a list that contains the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the new `result`.
