Precondition: **No variables in the function signature.** 

However, it's important to note that the function `func_2` reads input data and processes it to call another function `func_1` with the appropriate parameters. The input data is expected to be structured as described in the problem statement, with `t` test cases, each containing `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` as defined.
