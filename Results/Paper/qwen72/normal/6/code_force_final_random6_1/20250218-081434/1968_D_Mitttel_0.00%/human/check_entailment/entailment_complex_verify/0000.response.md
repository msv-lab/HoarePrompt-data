### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Parsing:**
   - The `func_2` function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and correctly splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the parameters for each test case (`n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`).
   - The indices are updated correctly to parse the input for each test case.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The `calculate_score` function is responsible for calculating the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It initializes the score and current position, and uses a dictionary `visited` to track the positions visited and the steps taken.
   - The function correctly handles the case where a cycle is detected in the permutation:
     - It calculates the cycle length and the score for one complete cycle.
     - It then calculates the score for the remaining steps after the cycle is detected, using the cycle score and the remainder steps.
   - The function returns the final score after `k` steps or after handling the cycle.

3. **Game Result Determination:**
   - The `func_1` function calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha with their respective starting positions.
   - It compares the scores and returns the appropriate result: 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw'.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program adheres to the constraints specified in the problem description:
     - `1 <= t <= 10^4`
     - `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`
     - `1 <= k <= 10^9`
     - `1 <= PB, PS <= n`
     - `1 <= p_i <= n`
     - `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`
   - The program correctly handles the possibility of cycles in the permutation, which is a crucial part of the problem.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The `calculate_score` function efficiently detects cycles and calculates the score for the remaining steps, ensuring that the program can handle large values of `k` and `n` within the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, handles cycles efficiently, and processes the input and output as expected. No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause the program to fail.

Final: **True**
