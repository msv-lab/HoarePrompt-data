Output State: **`input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`, `index` is 5 + `2 * n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of the string at `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of the string at `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of the string at `data[4]`, `p` is a list of integers from the strings at `data[5:5 + n]`, `a` is a list of integers from the strings at `data[5 + n:5 + 2 * n]`.** 

The value of `index` has been updated to `5 + 2 * n`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `index` is used to reference the next segment of the `data` list.
