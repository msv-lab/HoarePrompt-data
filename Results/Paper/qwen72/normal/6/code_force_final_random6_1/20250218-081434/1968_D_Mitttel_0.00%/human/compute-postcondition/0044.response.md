To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `input` is a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`.
   - `data` is a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`.
   - `index` is 0.
   - `t` must have been greater than 0 initially.
   - `results` is a list containing at least one value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.
   - `result` is the first value in `results`.
   - `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]` and also the integer value of the string at `data[5 + 2 * n]`, `data[5 + 4 * n]`, and so on.
   - `k` is the integer value of the string at `data[2]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 1]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 1]`, and so on.
   - `PB` is the integer value of the string at `data[3]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 2]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 2]`, and so on.
   - `PS` is the integer value of the string at `data[4]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 3]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 3]`, and so on.
   - `p` and `a` are lists of integers from the strings at the corresponding positions in `data` for each iteration.

2. **Understanding the `results` List:**
   - The `results` list contains values returned by the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.
   - Since `t` is greater than 0, it implies that the function `func_1` has been called at least once, and `results` contains at least one value.

3. **Determining the Value of `result`:**
   - `result` is the first value in the `results` list.
   - The exact value of `result` depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` passed to it.

4. **Input Data and Variables:**
   - The input data is read from `sys.stdin` and split into a list of strings `data`.
   - The values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, and `PS` are derived from specific indices in `data`.
   - The lists `p` and `a` are derived from the corresponding positions in `data` for each iteration.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the first value in the `results` list.
   - Since the exact implementation of `func_1` and the input data are not provided, we can only describe the value of `result` in terms of the function and the input data.

Output: **result (where result is the first value in the `results` list, which is the result of the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for the first set of parameters derived from the input data)**
