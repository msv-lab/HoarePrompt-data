Output State: **`remainder_steps` must be greater than 0, `score` is increased by the value of `a[p[current_pos - 1] - 1]` + `a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is now equal to `p[current_pos - 1]`**. 

The value of `score` is now the sum of its previous value and the value of `a[current_pos - 1]`. The value of `current_pos` remains unchanged as `p[current_pos - 1]`. The condition that `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
