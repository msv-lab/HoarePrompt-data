Output State: **`remainder_steps` must be greater than 1, `score` is increased by the value of `a[p[current_pos - 1] - 1]`, `current_pos` is now equal to `p[current_pos - 1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `score` is incremented by the value of `a[current_pos - 1]`.
- Since `current_pos` is now equal to `p[current_pos - 1]`, the new value of `score` is `score` + `a[p[current_pos - 1] - 1]`.
- The value of `remainder_steps` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1.
- The value of `current_pos` remains `p[current_pos - 1]`.
- Therefore, the updated state is: `remainder_steps` must be greater than 1, `score` is increased by the value of `a[p[current_pos - 1] - 1]`, and `current_pos` is now equal to `p[current_pos - 1]`.
