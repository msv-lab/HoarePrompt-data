Postcondition: ***`start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= `n`, `current_pos` is the position reached after `k` steps or the first repeated position if a cycle is detected, `score` is the sum of the values in `a` at the positions visited up to `k` steps or until a cycle is detected, `steps` is `k` or the number of steps taken until a cycle is detected, `visited` is a dictionary mapping each visited position to the step at which it was first visited, `cycle_start` is the step at which the first repeated position was visited if a cycle is detected, otherwise it remains -1. If `cycle_start` is not -1, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0, `score` is increased by the sum of the values of `a` at the positions visited during the `remainder_steps` iterations, and `current_pos` is now equal to the position it was at the end of the `remainder_steps` iterations.***
