Functionality: **The function `calculate_score` accepts an integer `start_pos` between 1 and `n`, where `n` is the length of the permutation `p` and the array `a`. It returns a score based on the following cases:**

- **Case 1:** If the process starts and no further steps are taken, the function returns the value of `a[start_pos - 1]`.
- **Case 2:** If the process moves to the next position based on `p[start_pos - 1]`, the function returns the sum of `a[start_pos - 1]` and `a[p[start_pos - 1] - 1]`.
- **Case 3:** If the process moves to the next position twice, the function returns the sum of `a[start_pos - 1]`, `a[p[start_pos - 1] - 1]`, and `a[p[p[start_pos - 1] - 1] - 1]`.
- **Case 4:** If the process continues for up to `k` steps or until a cycle is detected, the function returns the sum of the values in `a` at the positions visited. If a cycle is detected, the score is further increased by the sum of the values of `a` at the positions visited during the `remainder_steps` iterations.
