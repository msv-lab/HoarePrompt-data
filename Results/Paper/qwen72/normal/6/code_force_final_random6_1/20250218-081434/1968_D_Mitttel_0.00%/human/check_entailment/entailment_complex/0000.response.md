Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions and the given permutation and array.
   - It correctly uses the `calculate_score` function to compute the scores for both players.
   - The comparison logic to determine the winner is straightforward and correct.
   - The function does not modify any input parameters, which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Function 2 (`calculate_score`)**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It correctly handles the case where the player stays in the same position or moves to the next position in the permutation.
   - It detects cycles in the permutation and efficiently calculates the score for the remaining steps by leveraging the cycle length and cycle score.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the number of steps is less than `k` and the case where a cycle is detected.
   - The final score is correctly returned after all steps are processed.

3. **Function 3 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to handle multiple test cases.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by extracting the necessary parameters (`n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`).
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value, which is consistent with the problem description.

Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" and handle all the required cases, including cycle detection and efficient score calculation.

Correctness: **True**
