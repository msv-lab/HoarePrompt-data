### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes this list to extract the necessary values for each test case. This approach is efficient and avoids the overhead of reading input multiple times.
   - The input handling is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Test Case Loop**:
   - For each test case, `func_2` correctly extracts the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` from the input data. It then calls `func_1` with these values to determine the winner of the game.
   - The loop iterates the correct number of times (t test cases), and the indices are updated correctly to parse the input data.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The function `calculate_score` is responsible for calculating the score for a given starting position. It uses a dictionary `visited` to track the positions visited and the number of steps taken to reach each position.
   - The function correctly initializes the score, current position, and steps.
   - The while loop runs for up to `k` steps or until a cycle is detected. If a cycle is detected, the function calculates the cycle length and cycle score.
   - The remaining steps are processed to add the appropriate score for full cycles and the remaining steps within the cycle.

4. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The cycle detection is done using a dictionary `visited` to store the step at which each position is visited. If a position is visited again, a cycle is detected, and the cycle start is identified.
   - The cycle length and cycle score are calculated correctly.
   - The remaining steps are processed to add the appropriate score for full cycles and the remaining steps within the cycle.

5. **Final Score Comparison**:
   - The function `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha to get their final scores. It then compares these scores to determine the winner and returns the appropriate result.
   - The comparison of scores is straightforward and correct.

### Detailed Analysis of `calculate_score` Function:
- **Cycle Detection and Handling**:
  - The function correctly identifies cycles using the `visited` dictionary.
  - When a cycle is detected, it calculates the cycle length and cycle score.
  - The function then efficiently computes the score for the remaining steps by adding the score of full cycles and the score of the remaining steps within the cycle.
  - The handling of cycles ensures that the function can handle large values of `k` efficiently.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles the case where no cycle is detected and the game ends after `k` steps.
  - The function also handles the case where the starting position is part of a cycle.

### Final Evaluation:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The `calculate_score` function efficiently detects cycles and calculates the score for the remaining steps, ensuring that the score is computed correctly even for large values of `k`.
- The comparison of scores in `func_1` is straightforward and correct.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Final: **True**
