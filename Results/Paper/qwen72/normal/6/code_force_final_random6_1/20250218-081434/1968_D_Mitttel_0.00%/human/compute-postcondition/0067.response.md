Output State: **The program returns the final value of `score`, which is the sum of the values in `a` at the positions visited up to `k` steps or until a cycle is detected. If a cycle is detected, `score` is further increased by the sum of the values of `a` at the positions visited during the `remainder_steps` iterations.**
