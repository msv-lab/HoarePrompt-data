The only object in the loop head is the variable `remainder_steps`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `remainder_steps`. If `remainder_steps` is greater than 0, the loop will execute one more time.

At the end of the last iteration, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `remainder_steps` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`remainder_steps` must be greater than 1, `score` is increased by the value of `a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is now equal to `p[current_pos - 1]`**
