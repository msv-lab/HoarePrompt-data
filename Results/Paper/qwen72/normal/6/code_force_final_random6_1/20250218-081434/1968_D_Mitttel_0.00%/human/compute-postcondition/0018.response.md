The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue. The variable `_` is not used in the loop body, so it does not affect the state. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`, `index` is 5 + `2 * n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of the string at `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of the string at `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of the string at `data[4]`, `p` is a list of integers from the strings at `data[5:5 + n]`, `a` is a list of integers from the strings at `data[5 + n:5 + 2 * n]`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `t` is now `t - 1`**
