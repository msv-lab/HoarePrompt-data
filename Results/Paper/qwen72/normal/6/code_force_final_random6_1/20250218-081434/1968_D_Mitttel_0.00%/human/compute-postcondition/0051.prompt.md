You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        
        PB = int(data[index + 2])
        
        PS = int(data[index + 3])
        
        index += 4
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `input` is still a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` remains a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`, `index` is now `1 + 4 * t + 2 * t * n`, `t` must have been greater than 0 initially, `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration, `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]` and also the integer value of the string at `data[5 + 2 * n]`, `data[5 + 4 * n]`, and so on, `k` is the integer value of the string at `data[2]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 1]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 1]`, and so on, `PB` is the integer value of the string at `data[3]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 2]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 2]`, and so on, `PS` is the integer value of the string at `data[4]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 3]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 3]`, and so on, `p` and `a` are lists of integers from the strings at the corresponding positions in `data` for each iteration, and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for the last iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `input` is a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`, `index` is 0, `t` must have been greater than 0 initially, `results` is a list containing all the values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration, `result` is the last value in `results`, `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]` and also the integer value of the string at `data[5 + 2 * n]`, `data[5 + 4 * n]`, and so on, `k` is the integer value of the string at `data[2]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 1]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 1]`, and so on, `PB` is the integer value of the string at `data[3]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 2]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 2]`, and so on, `PS` is the integer value of the string at `data[4]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 3]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 3]`, and so on, `p` and `a` are lists of integers from the strings at the corresponding positions in `data` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and may return any value or perform any action, as it is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
