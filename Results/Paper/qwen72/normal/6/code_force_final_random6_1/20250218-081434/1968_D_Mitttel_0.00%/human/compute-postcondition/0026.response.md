Output State: **`input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`, `index` is 9 + `3 * n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]` and now also the integer value of the string at `data[5 + 2 * n]`, `k` is now the integer value of the string at `data[5 + 2 * n + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of the string at `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of the string at `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers from the strings at `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is now a list of integers from the strings at `data[index:index + n]`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `t` is now `t - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` updates the variable `a` to be a list of integers converted from the strings at `data[index:index + n]`.
- The values of `index` and `n` are used to slice the `data` list and convert the sliced strings to integers.
- All other variables (`input`, `data`, `index`, `t`, `results`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`) remain unchanged.
- The variable `t` is now `t - 1` as specified in the initial state.
- The variable `a` is now a list of integers from the strings at `data[index:index + n]`, which is the same as the list `p` in the initial state.
