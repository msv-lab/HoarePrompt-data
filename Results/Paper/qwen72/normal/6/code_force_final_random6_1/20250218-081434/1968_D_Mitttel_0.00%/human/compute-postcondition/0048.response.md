Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed when the `print(result)` statement executes.

### Initial State:
1. `input` is a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`.
2. `data` is a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`.
3. `index` is 0.
4. `t` must have been greater than 0 initially.
5. `results` is a list containing at least three values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.
6. `result` is the third value in `results`.
7. `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]` and also the integer value of the string at `data[5 + 2 * n]`, `data[5 + 4 * n]`, and so on.
8. `k` is the integer value of the string at `data[2]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 1]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 1]`, and so on.
9. `PB` is the integer value of the string at `data[3]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 2]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 2]`, and so on.
10. `PS` is the integer value of the string at `data[4]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 3]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 3]`, and so on.
11. `p` and `a` are lists of integers from the strings at the corresponding positions in `data` for each iteration.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: The `input` variable is a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, which means it reads the entire input from the standard input.
2. **Data Splitting**: The `data` list is created by splitting the input string. This means `data` will contain all the input values as strings.
3. **Iteration and Function Calls**: The variable `t` indicates the number of test cases. For each test case, the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` is called with the appropriate values from `data`.
4. **Function Parameters**:
   - `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]` for the first test case, and similarly for subsequent test cases.
   - `k` is the integer value of the string at `data[2]` for the first test case, and similarly for subsequent test cases.
   - `PB` is the integer value of the string at `data[3]` for the first test case, and similarly for subsequent test cases.
   - `PS` is the integer value of the string at `data[4]` for the first test case, and similarly for subsequent test cases.
   - `p` and `a` are lists of integers derived from the strings at the corresponding positions in `data` for each test case.
5. **Results List**: The `results` list contains the values returned by `func_1` for each test case.
6. **Result Variable**: The `result` variable is the third value in the `results` list, which means it is the third value returned by `func_1` for the first test case.

### Output Determination:
Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the `print(result)` statement will output the third value returned by the function `func_1` for the first test case.

### Final Output:
Output: **result (where result is the third value returned by `func_1` for the first test case)**
