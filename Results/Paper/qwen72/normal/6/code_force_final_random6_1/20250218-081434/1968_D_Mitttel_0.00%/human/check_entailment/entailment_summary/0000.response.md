Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract the necessary parameters for each test case, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It then collects the results and prints them. The function correctly handles the input format and the number of test cases, ensuring that each test case is processed independently.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function takes the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` and calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function. It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw'). The function does not modify its input parameters and correctly uses the `calculate_score` function to determine the final scores.

3. **Function `calculate_score`**: This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position `start_pos`. It follows the rules of the game by:
   - Summing the values in `a` at the positions visited by following the permutation `p` for up to `k` steps.
   - Detecting cycles in the permutation and calculating the score for the remaining steps using the cycle length and cycle score.
   - The function correctly handles the cycle detection and the calculation of the score for the remaining steps after the cycle is detected.

The provided functions together correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. They handle the input, process each test case, and produce the correct output based on the game rules. The cycle detection and score calculation in `calculate_score` ensure that the function can handle large values of `k` efficiently by avoiding unnecessary repeated calculations.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
