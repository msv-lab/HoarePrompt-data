Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `m` must be greater than `k + 1`, `u` is the first integer provided by the user, `v` is the second integer provided by the user, `f` is the third integer provided by the user, `a` is `f`, `s` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.**

The code snippet `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively. The values of `i`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `n`, `k`, `M`, and `c` remain unchanged. The new values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers provided by the user.
