You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. For each test case, it reads `m` lines of friendship data, where each line contains three integers representing a pair of children who are friends and their initial friendship value. The function calculates a value `s` based on the friendship values and the number of children, and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the value `s` has been computed and printed for each test case, and the input has been fully processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the logic for updating the sum of friendship values is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Probability**:
   - The program calculates `c` as the multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is incorrect because the number of possible pairs of children is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, not `n * (n - 1) // 1`.

2. **Incorrect Update of Friendship Values**:
   - The program updates the sum `s` in a loop with the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. This formula is incorrect. The expected value of the sum of friendship values should be calculated based on the probability of choosing a friend pair and the initial friendship values.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values should be calculated as follows:
     - For each excursion, the probability of choosing a friend pair is `m / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
     - The expected increase in the sum of friendship values for each excursion is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the number of excursions times the number of friend pairs.
     - The correct formula for the expected value should be:
       \[
       \text{expected\_value} = \left( \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \times \left( \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (a + i \times m) \right)
       \]
       where \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n \times (n-1)}{2}\).

4. **Modulo Arithmetic**:
   - The program should use modulo arithmetic correctly to handle large numbers and ensure the result is within the required range.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        if total_pairs == 0:
            print(0)
            continue
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % M
        expected_value = 0
        for i in range(k):
            expected_value = (expected_value + (a + i * m) * c) % M
        print(expected_value)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
