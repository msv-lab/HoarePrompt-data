The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, with the following constraints: 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 * 10^5. Additionally, `m` lines follow, each containing three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9, representing the indices of pairs of children who are friends and their initial friendship value. The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `k` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function returns the result of processing these test cases, which is not explicitly defined in the provided information. However, based on the input parameters and constraints, the function is likely to return some form of output related to the friendship values and the relationships between the children.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` with specific constraints, and `m` lines of friendship data. It processes these test cases and returns a result based on the friendship values and relationships between the children.**
