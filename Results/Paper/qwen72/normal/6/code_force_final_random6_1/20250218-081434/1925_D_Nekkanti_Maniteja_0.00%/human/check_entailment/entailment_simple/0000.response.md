### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `M` to \(10^9 + 7\) for the modulo operation.
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The function correctly sums the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends and stores it in `a`.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each of the `k` excursions.
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     s = s + c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a
     \]
     This formula is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the expected increase in friendship values over multiple excursions.

4. **Correct Formula:**
   - The correct expected value for the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions can be derived as follows:
     - For each excursion, the probability of choosing a pair of friends is \( \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \).
     - The expected increase in the sum of friendship values for a single excursion is \( \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times \left( \sum_{i=1}^{k} i \right) \).
     - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \).
     - Therefore, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions is:
       \[
       \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times \frac{k(k+1)}{2} = \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k+1)}{n(n-1)}
       \]
     - The initial sum of friendship values is `a`, and it remains constant for each excursion.
     - The total expected value is:
       \[
       \text{Total Expected Value} = a \cdot k + \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k+1)}{n(n-1)}
       \]

5. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The final result should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The function should use modular arithmetic to ensure all intermediate results are within the range.

### Correctness:
The given program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The correct formula should account for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers and the probability of choosing a pair of friends.

### Correct Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)  # Corrected to use the correct number of pairs
        
        a = 0
        
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        # Calculate the expected increase in friendship values
        expected_increase = (m * k * (k + 1) // 2) % M
        
        # Calculate the total expected value
        total_expected_value = (a * k + expected_increase * c) % M
        
        print(total_expected_value)
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
