Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `m` must be greater than `k + 1`, `u` is the first integer provided by the user, `v` is the second integer provided by the user, `f` is the third integer provided by the user, `a` is `2 * f`, `s` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is updated to `a + f`. Since `a` was initially `f`, the new value of `a` is `2 * f`.
- All other variables (`i`, `m`, `u`, `v`, `f`, `s`, `n`, `k`, `M`, `c`) remain unchanged.
