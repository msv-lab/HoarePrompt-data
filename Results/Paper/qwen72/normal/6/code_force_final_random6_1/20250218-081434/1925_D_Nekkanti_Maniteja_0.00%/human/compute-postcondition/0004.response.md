Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo 1000000007, `s` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `s` to 0. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
