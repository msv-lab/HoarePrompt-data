### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions.
   - The total number of possible pairs of children is \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair of friends in one excursion is \( \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \).

2. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends is \( a \).
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected number of new pairs of friends chosen.
   - The expected increase in friendship values for each excursion is:
     \[
     \text{Expected Increase} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times (i + 1)
     \]
   - This is because the friendship value of a chosen pair increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions, and the expected number of new pairs chosen in the \( i \)-th excursion is \( \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \).

3. **Sum of Friendship Values Over `k` Excursions:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = a + \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left( \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times (i + 1) \right)
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = a + \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (i + 1)
     \]
   - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \), so:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = a + \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = a + \frac{m \times k \times (k+1)}{n(n-1)}
     \]

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program correctly calculates the modular inverse of \( n(n-1) \) using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`.
   - The program sums the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
   - However, the program incorrectly calculates the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion. It should be:
     \[
     s = s + c \times m \times (i + 1) + c \times a
     \]
   - The program uses `c * i * c * m` which is incorrect. It should be `c * m * (i + 1)` to correctly account for the expected increase in each excursion.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program initializes the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It calculates the modular inverse of \( n(n-1) \) using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`.
   - It sums the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
   - It then iterates over `k` excursions, but the formula used to update `s` is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program incorrectly calculates the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion. The correct formula should be \( s = s + c \times m \times (i + 1) + c \times a \) instead of \( s = s + c \times i \times c \times m + c \times a \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
