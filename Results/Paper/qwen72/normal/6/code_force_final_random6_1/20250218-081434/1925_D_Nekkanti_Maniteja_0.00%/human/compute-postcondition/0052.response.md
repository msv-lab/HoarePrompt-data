Output State: **`i` is `k`, `k` must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `m` is the second input integer, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations, `s` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `s = 0` sets the variable `s` to 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
