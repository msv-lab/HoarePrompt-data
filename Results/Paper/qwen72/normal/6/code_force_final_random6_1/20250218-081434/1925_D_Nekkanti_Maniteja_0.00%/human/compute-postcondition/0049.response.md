Output State: **`i` is `k`, `k` must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `m` is the second input integer, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations, `s` is updated to `s + c * (k-1) * c * m + c * a`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer.**

The initial state variables `i`, `u`, `v`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged, but the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are now updated to the first, second, and third integers provided by the user, respectively. The condition that `k` must be less than the value provided by `int(input())` is still valid.
