Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is `s + c * c * m + c * a`**

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its current value. Since `i` is 0, the term `c * i * c * m` becomes 0, so the new value of `s` is `s + c * c * m + c * a`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
