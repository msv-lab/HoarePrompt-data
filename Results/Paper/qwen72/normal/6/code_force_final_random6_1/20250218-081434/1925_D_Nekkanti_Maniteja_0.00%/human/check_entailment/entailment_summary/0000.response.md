Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen for excursions, given the constraints and the problem description. Let's break down the program and the problem to see if it meets the requirements.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` and initializes the necessary variables.

2. **Modulo and Inverse Calculation**:
   - The program sets `M` to \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct for the problem's requirements.
   - It calculates the modular inverse of \(n \times (n - 1)\) using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`. This is the correct way to compute the modular inverse, and the division by 1 is unnecessary but does not affect the result.

3. **Friendship Value Sum**:
   - The program reads the friendship values for `m` pairs and sums them up in `a`.
   - This part is correct as it accumulates the initial friendship values.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program iterates `k` times to simulate each excursion.
   - For each excursion, it updates `s` with the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - The term `c * i * c * m` represents the expected increase in the sum of friendship values due to the chosen pairs being friends and their values increasing by 1 for each subsequent excursion.
   - The term `c * a` represents the expected contribution of the initial friendship values to the sum.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result `s % M` for each test case, which is the correct way to handle large numbers and ensure the result is within the required modulo.

However, there is a potential issue with the expected value calculation. The formula used in the loop `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` might not be entirely correct. The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion should be calculated as follows:

- The probability of choosing a friend pair in any excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
- The expected increase in the sum of friendship values due to the chosen pairs being friends and their values increasing by 1 for each subsequent excursion is \(\frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times i\).
- The expected contribution of the initial friendship values to the sum is \(\frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times a\).

Thus, the correct formula should be:
\[ s = s + \left(\frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times i\right) + \left(\frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times a\right) \]

Given that `c` is the modular inverse of \(n(n-1)\), the correct update should be:
\[ s = s + (2 \times c \times i \times m) + (2 \times c \times a) \]

The current implementation uses `c * i * c * m` instead of `2 * c * i * m`, and `c * a` instead of `2 * c * a`. This discrepancy means the program is not correctly calculating the expected value.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
