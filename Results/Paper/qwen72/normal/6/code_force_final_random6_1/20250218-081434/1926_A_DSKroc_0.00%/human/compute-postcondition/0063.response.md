Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, `s` is an input string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `q` is `t-1`, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in the last input string `s`, and `bc` is the number of 'B' characters in the last input string `s`. If `ac` > `bc`, the number of 'A' characters in `s` is greater than the number of 'B' characters in `s`. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.***
