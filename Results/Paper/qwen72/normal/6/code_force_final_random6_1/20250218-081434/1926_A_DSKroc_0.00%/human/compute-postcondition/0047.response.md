Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 <= t <= 32, `s` is an input string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `q` is 2, `ac` is 0, `bc` is 1, and the first character of `s` is 'B'.** 

The value of `bc` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
