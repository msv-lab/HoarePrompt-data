Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. The `if ac > bc:` and `else:` blocks are indented incorrectly, causing the program to only print the result of the last test case. The correct indentation should ensure that the result is printed for each test case individually.

Here is the corrected version of the program for reference:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
```
