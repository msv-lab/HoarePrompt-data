You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n`, where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`. For each subsequent element (from index 1 to `n-2`), `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i]` that can be formed by adding `ans[0]` multiple times to the cumulative sum of previous elements in `ans` and `arr`. The last element `ans[-1]` is the sum of the second-to-last element `ans[-2]` and the last element of `arr`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` containing `n-1` elements.
   - This matches the problem description and ensures that the input is handled correctly.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - The first element `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This is a valid choice because `1 \le a_i \le 10^9` and `arr[0] + 1` will always be greater than `arr[0]`.

3. **Constructing the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the array `arr` from the first to the second-to-last element.
   - For each element `i` in `arr`, it sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it enters a while loop to increment `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.
   - This ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is always greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, which is necessary for the modulo operation to produce the correct result.

4. **Final Element:**
   - The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
   - This ensures that `ans[-1] \bmod ans[-2] = arr[-1]`, which is required by the problem statement.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed array `ans` for each test case.
   - The output format matches the problem description, printing each element of `ans` separated by spaces.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The algorithm ensures that each `a_i` is constructed such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`.
- The while loop in the construction of `ans[i + 1]` ensures that the condition `ans[i + 1] >= arr[i + 1]` is met, which is necessary for the modulo operation to produce the correct result.
- The final element `ans[-1]` is constructed correctly to satisfy the last modulo condition.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge case where `n = 2` correctly by setting `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[1]` to `arr[0] + ans[0]`.
- The program also handles the case where `arr[i + 1]` is greater than `ans[i + 1]` by incrementing `ans[i + 1]` until it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
