To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `ans[i + 1]`: This is the value at index `i + 1` in the list `ans`.
   - `arr[i + 1]`: This is the value at index `i + 1` in the list `arr`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, and each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500.
   - `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500.
   - `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, with specific updates:
     - `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.
     - `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`.
     - `ans[n]` is updated to `arr[n-1] + ans[n-1]`.
     - If `ans[n]` is less than `arr[n-1]`, then `ans[1]` is updated to the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[1]` that can be expressed as a sum of `arr[0] + 1` added multiple times to `3 * arr[0] + 2`.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `ans[i + 1]` is now equal to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`.

3. **Condition for Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- **Current Value of `i`**:
  - `i` is `n - 2`, so `i + 1` is `n - 1`.

- **Current Value of `ans[i + 1]`**:
  - `ans[i + 1]` is `ans[n - 1]`, which is updated to `arr[n-1] + ans[n-1]` in the previous iteration.

- **Current Value of `arr[i + 1]`**:
  - `arr[i + 1]` is `arr[n - 1]`.

- **Condition Check**:
  - The loop condition is `ans[n - 1] <= arr[n - 1]`.
  - Given that `ans[n - 1]` is updated to `arr[n-1] + ans[n-1]` in the previous iteration, `ans[n - 1]` is now greater than `arr[n - 1]`.

### Conclusion:
- Since `ans[n - 1]` is now greater than `arr[n - 1]`, the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` is not satisfied.
- Therefore, the loop will not execute one more time with the current state.

### Adjusted State:
- No adjustment is needed because the loop condition is not met.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros with `ans[0]` now equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` now equal to `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`, and `ans[n]` is updated to `arr[n-1] + ans[n-1]`. If `ans[n]` is less than `arr[n-1]`, then `ans[1]` is updated to the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[1]` that can be expressed as a sum of `arr[0] + 1` added multiple times to `3 * arr[0] + 2`, and all other elements in `ans` remain unchanged. `i` is `n - 2`, and `ans[i + 1]` is now equal to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`.**
