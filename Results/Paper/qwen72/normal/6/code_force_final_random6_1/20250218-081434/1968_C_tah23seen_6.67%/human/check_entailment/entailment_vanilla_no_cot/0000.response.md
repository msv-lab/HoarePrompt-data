Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly address the problem statement. It constructs an array `a` such that for each `x_i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n`), the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` is satisfied. The logic in `func_1` ensures that each `a_i` is calculated based on the previous element `a_{i-1}` and the current `x_i` value, and it handles the case where `a_i` might need to be adjusted to ensure the condition is met. The program also correctly processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
