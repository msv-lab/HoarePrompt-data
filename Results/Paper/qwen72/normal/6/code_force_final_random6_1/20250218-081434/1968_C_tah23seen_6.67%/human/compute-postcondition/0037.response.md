Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n`, where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`. For each subsequent element (from index 1 to `n-2`), `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i]` that can be formed by adding `ans[0]` multiple times to the cumulative sum of previous elements in `ans` and `arr`. The last element `ans[-1]` is the sum of the second-to-last element `ans[-2]` and the last element of `arr`. **
