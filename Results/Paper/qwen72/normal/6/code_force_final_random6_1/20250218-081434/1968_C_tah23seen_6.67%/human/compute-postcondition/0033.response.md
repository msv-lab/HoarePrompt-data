Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[0]` added multiple times to the cumulative sum of `ans[0]` and `arr[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is:
- The list `arr` remains unchanged.
- The integer `n` is the length of `arr` plus one.
- The list `ans` is updated such that:
  - The first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.
  - For each subsequent element `ans[i]` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`), `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i]` that can be formed by repeatedly adding `ans[0]` to the cumulative sum of `ans[0]` and the elements of `arr` from index 0 to `i-1`.

This ensures that each element in `ans` from index 1 onwards is at least as large as the corresponding element in `arr`, and the values in `ans` are constructed in a way that they are multiples of `ans[0]` plus the cumulative sum of previous elements.
