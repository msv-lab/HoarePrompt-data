The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, but since `i` is already `n - 2`, the next value of `i` should be `n - 1`. However, for the loop condition to be true, `i` must be less than `n - 2`. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again because `n - 1` is not less than `n - 2`.

Since the loop cannot execute again, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would be the end of the loop) remains the same as the state at the end of the last iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros with `ans[0]` now equal to `arr[0] + 1`, and `ans[1]` now equal to `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then `ans[i + 1]` is updated to `arr[i + 1]`, and `i` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, the current value of `ans[i + 1]` remains equal to or greater than `arr[i + 1]`, and `i` is `n - 2`.**
