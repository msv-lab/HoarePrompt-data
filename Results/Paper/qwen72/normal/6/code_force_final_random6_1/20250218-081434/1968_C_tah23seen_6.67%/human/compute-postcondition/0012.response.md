Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros with `ans[0]` now equal to `arr[0] + 1`, and `ans[1]` now equal to `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then `ans[i + 1]` is updated to `arr[i + 1]`, and `i` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, the current value of `ans[i + 1]` remains equal to or greater than `arr[i + 1]`, and `i` is `n - 2`.***
