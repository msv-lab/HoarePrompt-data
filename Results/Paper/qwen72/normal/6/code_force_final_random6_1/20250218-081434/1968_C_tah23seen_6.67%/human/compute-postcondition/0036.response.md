The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers with a length between 1 and 500, and each element in the list is between 1 and 500; and `n`, which is an integer between 2 and 500 and is equal to the length of `arr` plus one.

The function returns a list `ans` of length `n`, where:
- `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.
- For each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[0]` added multiple times to the cumulative sum of `ans[0]` and `arr[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-1`.
- The last element `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n`, where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, each subsequent element (up to the second-to-last) is the smallest value greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `arr` that can be formed by adding `ans[0]` multiple times to the cumulative sum of previous elements, and the last element is the sum of the second-to-last element and the last element of `arr`.**
