You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and p are lists of integers of the same length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), where each element in p is a unique integer from 1 to n, and each element in a is a positive integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). s is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (1 ≤ s[0], s[1] ≤ n). k is a positive integer representing the number of turns in the game (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the following changes have occurred: `s` is now the position in `p` that was last visited before the loop terminated. `k` is 0 or the number of remaining turns that were not executed because the position `s` was already visited. `mx` is the maximum value calculated during the loop, which is the greatest value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered. `cur` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` that were visited during the loop. `vis` is a list of `n` integers where each visited position in `p` has a value of 1, and all other positions remain 0. The lists `a` and `p` remain unchanged, and `n` is still the length of the list `p`.
    return mx
    #The program returns the maximum value `mx` calculated during the loop, which is the greatest value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `a`, `p`, `s`, and `k`. It returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop, where `cur` is a value that changes based on the elements in `p` and `a`, and `s` represents the starting positions of two players.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum value `mx` calculated during the loop, which is the greatest value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
