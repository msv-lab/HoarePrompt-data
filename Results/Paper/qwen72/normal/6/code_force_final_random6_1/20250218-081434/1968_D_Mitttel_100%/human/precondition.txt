a and p are lists of integers of the same length n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each element a_i and p_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n. s is a list of two integers [P_B, P_S] representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n. k is a positive integer representing the number of turns, where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
