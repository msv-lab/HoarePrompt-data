The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a`, `p`, `s`, and `k`. 

- `a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), where each element is a positive integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
- `p` is a list of integers of the same length `n`, where each element is a unique integer from 1 to `n`.
- `s` is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (1 ≤ s[0], s[1] ≤ n).
- `k` is a positive integer representing the number of turns in the game (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).

The function returns the maximum value `mx` calculated during the loop, which is the greatest value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `a`, `p`, `s`, and `k`. It returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop, where `cur` is a value that changes based on the elements in `p` and `a`, and `s` represents the starting positions of two players.**
