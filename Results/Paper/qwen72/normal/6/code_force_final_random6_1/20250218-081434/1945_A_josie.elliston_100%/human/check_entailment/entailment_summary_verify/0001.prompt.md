You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
from math import ceil
from typing import Optional
#Function 1:
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
            return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

#Function 2:
def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts three non-negative integer parameters `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`. It calls another function `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments. If `func_1` returns `None`, `func_2` returns -1. Otherwise, `func_2` returns the sum of `introverts` and the value returned by `func_1`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate `a` introverts, `b` extroverts, and `c` universals.
   - Introverts must live alone in a tent.
   - Extroverts must live in a tent with exactly two others.
   - Universals can live in any tent configuration: alone, with one other, or with two others.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, we need to check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
   - If `extroverts % 3` is not zero and `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means we cannot form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts and universals, so we return `None`.
   - Otherwise, we calculate the total number of tents needed for extroverts and universals using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**
   - This function combines the results of `func_1` with the number of tents needed for introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so we return `-1`.
   - Otherwise, we add the number of tents needed for introverts to the result from `func_1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Case 1: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3`**
     - 1 introvert needs 1 tent.
     - 2 extroverts need 1 tent (with 1 universal).
     - 2 universals need 1 tent.
     - Total: 3 tents.
   - **Case 2: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 1`**
     - 1 introvert needs 1 tent.
     - 4 extroverts need 2 tents (each with 1 universal).
     - 1 universal is not enough to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
     - Total: -1 (impossible).
   - **Case 3: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 2`**
     - 1 introvert needs 1 tent.
     - 4 extroverts need 2 tents (each with 1 universal).
     - 2 universals are enough to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
     - Total: 3 tents.
   - **Case 4: `a = 1, b = 1, c = 1`**
     - 1 introvert needs 1 tent.
     - 1 extrovert needs 1 tent (with 2 universals).
     - 1 universal is not enough to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
     - Total: -1 (impossible).
   - **Case 5: `a = 1, b = 3, c = 2`**
     - 1 introvert needs 1 tent.
     - 3 extroverts need 1 tent (with 0 universals).
     - 2 universals need 1 tent.
     - Total: 3 tents.
   - **Case 6: `a = 19, b = 7, c = 18`**
     - 19 introverts need 19 tents.
     - 7 extroverts need 3 tents (with 2 universals in each).
     - 18 universals are enough to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
     - Total: 28 tents.
   - **Case 7: `a = 0, b = 0, c = 0`**
     - No participants, so no tents needed.
     - Total: 0 tents.
   - **Case 8: `a = 7, b = 0, c = 0`**
     - 7 introverts need 7 tents.
     - Total: 7 tents.
   - **Case 9: `a = 0, b = 24, c = 0`**
     - 24 extroverts need 8 tents (each with 3 extroverts).
     - Total: 8 tents.
   - **Case 10: `a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000, c = 1000000000`**
     - 1000000000 introverts need 1000000000 tents.
     - 1000000000 extroverts need 333333334 tents (each with 3 extroverts).
     - 1000000000 universals can be used to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
     - Total: 1666666667 tents.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases and the general cases.
   - The logic for calculating the number of tents for extroverts and universals is sound.
   - The logic for combining the results with the number of tents needed for introverts is also correct.
