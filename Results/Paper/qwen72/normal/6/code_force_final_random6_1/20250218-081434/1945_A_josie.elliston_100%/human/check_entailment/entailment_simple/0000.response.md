### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
   - Universals can be in a tent with any number of people (1, 2, or 3).

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function is responsible for calculating the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate extroverts and universals.
   - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents to make them full (i.e., `extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3`).
   - If there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, it returns `None`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function calculates the total number of tents needed by adding the number of tents required for introverts (which is simply `introverts` since each introvert needs a separate tent) to the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts, and `func_2` returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the value returned by `func_1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Case 1:** If there are no extroverts and universals, the function should return the number of introverts, which is correct.
   - **Case 2:** If there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots for extroverts, the function should return `-1`, which is correctly handled by `func_1`.
   - **Case 3:** If there are more universals than needed, the function should still return the minimum number of tents, which is correctly handled by the ceiling function in `func_1`.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `1 2 3`
     - `introverts = 1` (1 tent)
     - `extroverts = 2` and `universals = 3`
     - `func_1(2, 3)` returns `2` (2 tents for 2 extroverts and 2 universals)
     - Total tents: `1 + 2 = 3` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 2:** `1 4 1`
     - `introverts = 1` (1 tent)
     - `extroverts = 4` and `universals = 1`
     - `func_1(4, 1)` returns `None` (1 universal is not enough to fill the remaining spot for 4 extroverts)
     - Total tents: `-1` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 3:** `1 4 2`
     - `introverts = 1` (1 tent)
     - `extroverts = 4` and `universals = 2`
     - `func_1(4, 2)` returns `2` (2 tents for 4 extroverts and 2 universals)
     - Total tents: `1 + 2 = 3` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 4:** `1 1 1`
     - `introverts = 1` (1 tent)
     - `extroverts = 1` and `universals = 1`
     - `func_1(1, 1)` returns `None` (1 universal is not enough to fill the remaining 2 spots for 1 extrovert)
     - Total tents: `-1` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 5:** `1 3 2`
     - `introverts = 1` (1 tent)
     - `extroverts = 3` and `universals = 2`
     - `func_1(3, 2)` returns `2` (1 tent for 3 extroverts, 1 tent for 2 universals)
     - Total tents: `1 + 2 = 3` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 6:** `19 7 18`
     - `introverts = 19` (19 tents)
     - `extroverts = 7` and `universals = 18`
     - `func_1(7, 18)` returns `9` (7 extroverts and 18 universals can be accommodated in 9 tents)
     - Total tents: `19 + 9 = 28` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 7:** `0 0 0`
     - `introverts = 0` (0 tents)
     - `extroverts = 0` and `universals = 0`
     - `func_1(0, 0)` returns `0` (0 tents)
     - Total tents: `0 + 0 = 0` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 8:** `7 0 0`
     - `introverts = 7` (7 tents)
     - `extroverts = 0` and `universals = 0`
     - `func_1(0, 0)` returns `0` (0 tents)
     - Total tents: `7 + 0 = 7` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 9:** `0 24 0`
     - `introverts = 0` (0 tents)
     - `extroverts = 24` and `universals = 0`
     - `func_1(24, 0)` returns `8` (24 extroverts can be accommodated in 8 tents)
     - Total tents: `0 + 8 = 8` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 10:** `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
     - `introverts = 1000000000` (1000000000 tents)
     - `extroverts = 1000000000` and `universals = 1000000000`
     - `func_1(1000000000, 1000000000)` returns `666666667` (1000000000 extroverts and 1000000000 universals can be accommodated in 666666667 tents)
     - Total tents: `1000000000 + 666666667 = 1666666667` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and edge cases as described in the problem. It ensures that introverts are accommodated in separate tents, extroverts are accommodated in full tents, and universals are used to fill the remaining spots as needed. The program also correctly returns `-1` when it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts.

**Correctness: True**
