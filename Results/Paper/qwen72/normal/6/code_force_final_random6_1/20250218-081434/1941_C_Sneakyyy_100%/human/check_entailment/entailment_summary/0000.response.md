Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the string and checking for the substrings "map" and "pie". If either substring is found, it increments the count of deletions (`ans`) and skips the next two characters to avoid overlapping checks. However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. **Overlapping Substrings**: The program only counts non-overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie". This means that if a string like "mappie" is encountered, it will only count one occurrence and not both "map" and "pie". This is incorrect because removing "map" would still leave "pie" in the string, and vice versa.

2. **Minimum Deletions**: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. It simply counts the number of times "map" or "pie" appear as non-overlapping substrings, which is not the same as the minimum deletions needed to remove all occurrences of these substrings.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the substrings "map" and "pie" overlap in such a way that removing fewer characters could make the string beautiful. For example, in the string "mappie", the correct answer should be 3 (removing 'm', 'p', and 'i' to make the string "appe"), but the program would output 1.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should use a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm, to ensure that the minimum number of deletions is calculated accurately.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
