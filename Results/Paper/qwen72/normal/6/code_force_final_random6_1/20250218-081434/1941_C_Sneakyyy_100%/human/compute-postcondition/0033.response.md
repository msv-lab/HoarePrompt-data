Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string with length greater than 2, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the first 3 characters of `a`.** 

The code snippet assigns the first 3 characters of the string `a` to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
