Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string with length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and of length 3, `ans` is 1 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is 4, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2. `len(a)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 4, or greater than 3 if `i` is 2.** 

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was initially 3, it is now 4. If `i` was initially 1, it is now 2. The conditions for `ans` and `len(a)` are updated based on the new value of `i`. Other variables remain unchanged.
