Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string with length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`. If `s` was initially 'map' or 'pie', `i` is 6 and `ans` is 2. Otherwise, if `s` was not initially 'map' or 'pie', `i` is 4 and `ans` is 1. If `s` was not initially 'map' or 'pie', and the else part executed, `i` is 2 and `ans` is 0.***
