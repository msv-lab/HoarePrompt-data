Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last input string, `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, and `i` is the length of `a` minus 2 or the index just after the last processed character that was part of a 'map' or 'pie' substring.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the following conditions hold true:
- The value of `t` remains the same as it was initially, within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` holds the last input integer for the final test case.
- The variable `a` holds the last input string for the final test case.
- The variable `ans` contains the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the last input string `a`.
- The variable `i` is the index just past the last character of the last 3-character substring checked in the final input string `a`, which can be `len(a) - 2` or less, depending on whether the last processed substring was 'map' or 'pie'.
