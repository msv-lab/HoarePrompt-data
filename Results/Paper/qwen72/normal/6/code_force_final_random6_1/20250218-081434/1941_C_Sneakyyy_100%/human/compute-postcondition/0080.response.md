To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This indicates that `t` is a positive integer within a specific range.
   - `n` is a new input integer. The value of `n` is not specified, but it is an integer.
   - `a` is a new input string. The value of `a` is not specified, but it is a string.
   - `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`. This suggests that `_` is a loop counter or an index that is incremented and checked against an input value.
   - `i` is either `len(a) - 2` or `len(a) - 1`. This means `i` is an index that points to the second-to-last or last character of the string `a`.
   - `ans` is the total number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(ans)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`.
   - `ans` is defined as the total number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.
   - Since the exact value of `a` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` will be the count of these substrings in `a`.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the value of `ans`, which is the count of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string a)**
