Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a new input string with length greater than 8, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2` (inclusive), `ans` remains 0 or 1 depending on whether `s` was 'map' or 'pie' initially, `i` is 5 or 7 depending on whether `s` was 'map' or 'pie' initially, and `len(a) - 2` must be greater than 6.**
