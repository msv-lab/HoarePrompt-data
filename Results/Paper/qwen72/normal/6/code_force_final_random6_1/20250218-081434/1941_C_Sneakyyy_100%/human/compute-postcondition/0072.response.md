Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a new input string with length greater than 2, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2` (inclusive). If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `s` was 'map' or 'pie' initially, and `i` is 4 or 6 depending on whether `s` was 'map' or 'pie' initially. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', `ans` remains 0 or 1 depending on whether `s` was 'map' or 'pie' initially, and `i` is 2 or 4 depending on whether `s` was 'map' or 'pie' initially. In both cases, `len(a) - 2` must be greater than 3 if `i` is 4 or 6, otherwise, `len(a) - 2` must be greater than 1.***
