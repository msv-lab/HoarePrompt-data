### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the number of characters to be removed.
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0, which will be used to traverse the string `a`.

3. **Substring Check**:
   - The program uses a while loop to traverse the string `a` with a step of 1.
   - Inside the loop, it checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" starting from the current position `i`.
   - If a substring "map" or "pie" is found, it increments `i` by 3 to skip the next two characters and increments `ans` by 1 to count the removal of one character.
   - If no such substring is found, it increments `i` by 1 to move to the next character.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing the string, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters to be removed to make the string beautiful.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The program correctly identifies the substrings "map" and "pie" and removes the minimum number of characters to eliminate these substrings.
- However, the logic of incrementing `ans` by 1 when a substring is found is incorrect. Removing one character from a substring of length 3 (like "map" or "pie") will not necessarily make the string beautiful. Instead, the correct approach is to remove the entire substring of length 3, which means `ans` should be incremented by 3.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issue, the program should increment `ans` by 3 when a substring "map" or "pie" is found, and `i` should be incremented by 3 to skip the next two characters.

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                i += 3
                ans += 3  # Corrected: Increment ans by 3
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the number of characters to be removed when a substring "map" or "pie" is found.

Correctness: **False**
