Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, and `i` is the length of `a` minus 2 or the index just after the last processed character that was part of a 'map' or 'pie' substring.**

The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
