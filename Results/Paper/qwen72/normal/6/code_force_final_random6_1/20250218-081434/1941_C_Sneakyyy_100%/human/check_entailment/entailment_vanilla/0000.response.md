### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `a`.

2. **Loop Through the String**:
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through the string `a` from the beginning to the end.
   - The loop checks substrings of length 3 starting from the current index `i`.

3. **Substring Check**:
   - If the substring `s` is either "map" or "pie", the program increments `i` by 3 to skip the next two characters and increments the answer `ans` by 1 to count the removal of one character.
   - If the substring is not "map" or "pie", the program increments `i` by 1 to move to the next character.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing the string for each test case, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Increment in `ans`**:
  - The program increments `ans` by 1 when it finds a substring "map" or "pie". However, to make the string beautiful, we need to remove 2 characters from "map" or "pie" (since removing one character is not enough to eliminate the substring).
  - Therefore, `ans` should be incremented by 2 instead of 1.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                i += 3
                ans += 2  # Corrected increment
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)
```

### Correctness:
- **False**: The original program incorrectly increments `ans` by 1 when it should increment by 2 to correctly count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.
