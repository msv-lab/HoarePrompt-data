Reasoning:

The provided program does not match the problem description and requirements. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func()` is defined, but it does not follow the problem's input and output format. The function should handle multiple test cases and queries within each test case.
   - The input handling is incorrect. The function `R` is used to read integers from input, but it is not used correctly to read the array `a` and the queries.

2. **Array and Set Handling**:
   - The array `a` is read into a set, which means that duplicate elements are removed. This is incorrect because the problem requires finding indices of different elements within a specified range, and sets do not preserve the original indices.
   - The variable `b` is also read into a set, but the problem does not mention any set `b` in the input or output.

3. **Logic and Variables**:
   - The variables `m`, `n`, and `f` are used in a way that does not align with the problem's requirements. The problem asks to find indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` within a specified range, but the program is performing set operations and bitwise logic that are not relevant to this task.
   - The loop iterates over the range `1` to `k`, but `k` is not defined in the problem. The loop should iterate over the queries, not some undefined range.

4. **Output**:
   - The output is generated using a string slicing technique that does not match the required output format. The problem requires outputting two indices or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists, but the program outputs a string based on some bitwise operations.

Given these significant mismatches between the program and the problem requirements, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
