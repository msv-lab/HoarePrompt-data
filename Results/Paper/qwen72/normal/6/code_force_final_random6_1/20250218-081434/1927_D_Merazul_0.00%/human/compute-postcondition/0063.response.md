Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 3, `n` is `k // 2`, `a` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, `k` is the last element returned by the function `R()`, `b` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `f` is 1, `m` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `u` and `v` are `False` because the loop has finished and `i` is no longer in the range from 1 to `k`.**
