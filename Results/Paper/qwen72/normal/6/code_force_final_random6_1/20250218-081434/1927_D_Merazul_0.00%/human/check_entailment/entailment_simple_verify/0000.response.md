### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Let's break down why this is the case:

1. **Function `R` and Input Handling**:
   - `R = lambda : map(int, input().split())` is used to read integers from the input. This is correct for reading the inputs as specified.
   - `(t,) = R()` reads the number of test cases, which is correct.
   - `*_, k = R()` reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q` but assigns them to `k`. This is incorrect because `k` should be `n` and the number of queries should be read separately.
   - `a = {*R()}` reads the array `a` and converts it to a set. This is incorrect because the array should be a list, not a set, to preserve the order and allow for indexing.
   - `b = {*R()}` reads the queries and converts them to a set. This is incorrect because the queries should be a list of pairs, not a set.

2. **Logic for Finding Pairs**:
   - The program uses a loop `for i in range(1, k + 1)` to check the presence of integers from 1 to `k` in the sets `a` and `b`. This is completely unrelated to the problem of finding pairs of different elements within specified query ranges.
   - The variables `f`, `m`, and `n` are used to perform bitwise operations and count elements, but these operations do not correspond to the task of finding pairs of different elements within the array.
   - The output `print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])` is a ternary-like operation that prints "YES" or "NO" based on the values of `f`, `m`, and `n`. This is not the correct output format for the problem, which requires indices of different elements or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

3. **Expected Behavior vs. Actual Behavior**:
   - For the given example input:
     ```
     1
     5
     1 1 2 1 1
     3
     1 5
     1 2
     1 3
     ```
   - The expected output is:
     ```
     2 3
     -1 -1
     1 3
     ```
   - The provided program does not produce this output. Instead, it performs operations that are not relevant to the problem and outputs something unrelated.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect and does not solve the given problem. It fails to correctly read the input, process the queries, and produce the required output. The original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.
