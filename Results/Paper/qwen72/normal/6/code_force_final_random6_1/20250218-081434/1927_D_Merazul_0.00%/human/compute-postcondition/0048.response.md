Explanation:
- The code `n -= ~u & v` updates the value of `n` based on the values of `u` and `v`.
- The expression `~u & v` is evaluated as follows:
  - `~u` is the bitwise NOT of `u`. If `u` is `True` (1), `~u` is `-2` (in two's complement, this is equivalent to `1` in a boolean context). If `u` is `False` (0), `~u` is `-1` (in two's complement, this is equivalent to `1` in a boolean context).
  - `& v` performs a bitwise AND with `v`. If `v` is `True` (1), the result is `1` if `u` is `False` and `0` if `u` is `True`.
- Therefore, the expression `~u & v` is `0` if `u` is `True` and `v` is `True` or `False`, and `1` if `u` is `False` and `v` is `True`.
- If `u` is `False` and `v` is `True`, `n` is decremented by 1, so `n` becomes `k // 2 - 1`.
- If `u` is `True` and `v` is `True`, `n` is incremented by 1, so `n` becomes `k // 2 + 1`.
- If `u` is `True` and `v` is `False`, or if `u` is `False` and `v` is `False`, `n` remains unchanged, so `n` is `k // 2`.
