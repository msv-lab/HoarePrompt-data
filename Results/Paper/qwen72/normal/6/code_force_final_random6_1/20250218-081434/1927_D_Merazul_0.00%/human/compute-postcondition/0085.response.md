The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it accepts:
  - `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the array `a`.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
  - `q`: An integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of queries.
  - Each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.

The function returns the results of the queries for each test case. The exact return value for each query is not specified, but it is implied that the function processes the array `a` based on the queries and returns some form of output for each query.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, the array `a` itself, an integer `q` representing the number of queries, and a list of queries, each defined by two integers `l` and `r`. For each test case, the function processes the array `a` based on the queries and returns the results of these queries.**
