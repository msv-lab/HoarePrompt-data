### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals (both main and anti-diagonals) have at least one colored cell.
   - The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The program reads input from standard input, where each line contains two integers \( n \) and \( k \).
   - The program then calculates the minimum number of cells to color using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{result} = (k // 2 + k \% 2) \times (k < 4n - 3) + 2n \times (k \geq 4n - 3) + (k == 4n - 2)
     \]

3. **Breaking Down the Formula:**
   - \( k // 2 + k \% 2 \): This expression calculates the ceiling of \( k / 2 \). It ensures that if \( k \) is odd, it rounds up to the next integer.
   - \( (k < 4n - 3) \): This is a boolean check that returns 1 if \( k \) is less than \( 4n - 3 \) and 0 otherwise.
   - \( 2n \times (k \geq 4n - 3) \): This part of the formula ensures that if \( k \) is at least \( 4n - 3 \), the result is \( 2n \). This is because if \( k \) is this large, we need to color all cells in one row and one column to cover all diagonals.
   - \( (k == 4n - 2) \): This is a boolean check that returns 1 if \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \) and 0 otherwise. This is a special case where all diagonals are covered by coloring the entire grid.

4. **Verification of the Formula:**
   - For \( k < 4n - 3 \), the formula \( k // 2 + k \% 2 \) correctly calculates the minimum number of cells needed to cover \( k \) diagonals. This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals, and if \( k \) is odd, we need an extra cell to cover the remaining diagonal.
   - For \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), the formula \( 2n \) correctly calculates the minimum number of cells needed. This is because coloring one row and one column will cover all but one diagonal, and we need one more cell to cover the last diagonal.
   - The special case \( k == 4n - 2 \) is handled by adding 1 to the result, ensuring that all diagonals are covered.

5. **Testing the Program:**
   - The program correctly handles the input format and processes each test case.
   - The formula used in the program matches the logic required to solve the problem.
