#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_cells_to_color(n, k):` where `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: `[*open(0)][1:]` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the last integers processed by the loop, and the loop has completed all its iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads lines from the standard input, processes each line to extract two integers `n` and `k`, and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to ensure that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell. After processing all lines, the function completes, and the final state is that the input has been fully read and the results have been printed for each line. The function does not return any value.
