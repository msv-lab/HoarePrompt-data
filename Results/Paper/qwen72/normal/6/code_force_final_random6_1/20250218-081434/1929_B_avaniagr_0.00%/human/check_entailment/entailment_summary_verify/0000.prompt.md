You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads lines from the standard input, processes each line to extract two integers `n` and `k`, and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to ensure that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell. After processing all lines, the function completes, and the final state is that the input has been fully read and the results have been printed for each line. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum number of cells to color is flawed. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `k == 4 * n - 2`**:
   - The program adds 1 to the result when `k == 4 * n - 2`. However, this is not always correct. For example, when `n = 3` and `k = 10`, the program should output 6, but it outputs 7.

2. **Incorrect Logic for `k >= 4 * n - 3`**:
   - The program multiplies `2 * n` when `k >= 4 * n - 3`. This is not always the correct minimum number of cells to color. For example, when `n = 3` and `k = 9`, the program should output 5, but it outputs 6.

3. **General Formula**:
   - The formula `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` does not correctly handle all cases. It should be more carefully designed to ensure the minimum number of cells is colored for any given `n` and `k`.

To illustrate, let's consider the following test cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`, `k = 4`
  - The program outputs 2, which is correct.
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `k = 3`
  - The program outputs 2, which is correct.
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `k = 10`
  - The program outputs 7, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 6.
- **Test Case 4**: `n = 3`, `k = 9`
  - The program outputs 6, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 5.
- **Test Case 5**: `n = 4`, `k = 7`
  - The program outputs 4, which is correct.
- **Test Case 6**: `n = 7`, `k = 11`
  - The program outputs 6, which is correct.
- **Test Case 7**: `n = 2`, `k = 3`
  - The program outputs 2, which is correct.

The program fails to handle the cases where `k` is close to `4 * n - 2` correctly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
