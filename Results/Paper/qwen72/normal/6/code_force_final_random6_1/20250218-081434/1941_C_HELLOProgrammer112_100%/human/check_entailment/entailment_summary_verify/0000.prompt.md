You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        z = s.count('mapie')
        print(x + y - z)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from the input, counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' within `s`, and prints the result of `x + y - z`, where `x` is the count of 'map', `y` is the count of 'pie', and `z` is the count of 'mapie'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The final state of the program includes the last input string `s`, the counts `x`, `y`, and `z` for the last string, and the loop variable `_` which is equal to `a - 1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it only counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and subtracts the occurrences of "mapie". However, this approach does not account for the fact that the substrings "map" and "pie" can overlap in different ways, and the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful is not simply the sum of the counts of these substrings minus the count of "mapie".

For example, consider the string "mappie":
- The program will count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie".
- It will also count 0 occurrences of "mapie".
- Therefore, the program will output 1 + 1 - 0 = 2.

However, the correct answer should be 1, because removing the 'p' at index 1 (0-based index) will make the string "maie", which is beautiful.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
