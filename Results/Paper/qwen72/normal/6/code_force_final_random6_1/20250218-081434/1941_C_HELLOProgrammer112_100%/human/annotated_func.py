#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def make_beautiful(s: str) -> int:` where `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        x = s.count('map')
        
        y = s.count('pie')
        
        z = s.count('mapie')
        
        print(x + y - z)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `a` times, where `a` is the initial input integer. The variable `_` has been incremented by `a` and is now equal to `a - 1`. The variable `s` is the last input string provided, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the last `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the last `s`, and `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in the last `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from the input, counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' within `s`, and prints the result of `x + y - z`, where `x` is the count of 'map', `y` is the count of 'pie', and `z` is the count of 'mapie'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The final state of the program includes the last input string `s`, the counts `x`, `y`, and `z` for the last string, and the loop variable `_` which is equal to `a - 1`.
