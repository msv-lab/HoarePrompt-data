Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect for the given problem description. The function `func` does not correctly implement the logic to make the string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. Here are the issues:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func` is not defined with any parameters, which is not in line with the problem statement. The function should take a string `s` as input and return an integer representing the minimum number of characters to delete.

2. **Counting Substrings Incorrectly**: The program counts the occurrences of 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' using the `count` method. However, this approach is flawed because:
   - `s.count('map')` and `s.count('pie')` will count overlapping occurrences, which is not what we need.
   - `s.count('mapie')` is not relevant to the problem since we are only concerned with 'map' and 'pie' as separate substrings.

3. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program prints `x + y - z`, which is not the correct way to determine the minimum number of deletions. The correct approach should involve finding the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' as substrings.

4. **Handling Overlapping Substrings**: The program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the string "mappie", the program will count 'map' and 'pie' separately, but we need to consider the overlapping nature of these substrings to minimize deletions.

5. **Test Case Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and the length of the string `n`, but it does not use `n` in any meaningful way. The length of the string is not necessary for solving the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Identify all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string.
- Use a dynamic programming or sliding window approach to find the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of these substrings.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
