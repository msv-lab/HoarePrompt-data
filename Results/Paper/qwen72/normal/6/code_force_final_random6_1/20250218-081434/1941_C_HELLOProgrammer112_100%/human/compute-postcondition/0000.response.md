The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `s` and its length `n` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, for the function to be correctly defined as per the problem description, `s` should be a string of lowercase Latin letters and its length `n` should satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
