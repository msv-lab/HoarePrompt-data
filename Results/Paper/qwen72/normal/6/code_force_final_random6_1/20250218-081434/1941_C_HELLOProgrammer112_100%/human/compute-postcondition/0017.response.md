Output State: **`a` is an input integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `s` is the new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`, `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in the new `s`**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`.
- The values of `a`, `_`, `s`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
