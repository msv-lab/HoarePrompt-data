Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains two integers, `n` is the first integer input, `q` is the second integer input, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.** 

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `result` now holds the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.
