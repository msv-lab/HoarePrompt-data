Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains two integers provided by the user, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The variable `operations` is now a list containing `n` sublists, where each sublist contains two integers provided by the user.
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1, but since it is a loop variable, its specific value is not tracked.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `queries`, and `result`) remain unchanged and retain their initial states.
