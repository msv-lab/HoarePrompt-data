Output State: **The program returns a list `result` containing the elements at indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` of `array` for each `k` in `queries`.**

In natural language: The program returns a list called `result`, where each element in `result` corresponds to the element in `array` at the index `(k - 1) % len(array)`, for each positive integer `k` in the list `queries`. The `array` is a list that has been modified according to the operations specified in the `operations` list. The length of `result` is the same as the length of `queries`.
