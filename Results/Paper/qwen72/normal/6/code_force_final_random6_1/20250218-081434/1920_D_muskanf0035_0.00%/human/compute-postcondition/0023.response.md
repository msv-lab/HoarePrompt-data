Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of tuples, `queries` is a non-empty list of positive integers, `array` is a list modified according to the operations, `result` is a list containing the elements at indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` of `array` for each `k` in `queries`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all iterations, the variables `n`, `operations`, and `queries` remain unchanged. The `array` is still the list that has been modified according to the operations specified in the `operations` list. The `result` list now contains the elements from the `array` at the indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in the `queries` list. This means that for each query index `k` in `queries`, the corresponding element from `array` has been appended to `result`, taking into account the modulo operation to handle indices that are out of bounds.
