The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n`: a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5.
- `q`: a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5.
- `operations`: a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains two integers `b` and `x`.
- `queries`: a list of `q` positive integers.

The function returns a list of results based on the `queries` and the `operations` performed. Each result corresponds to a query and is determined by the operations applied.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t`, a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `q`, a list of `n` operations where each operation is a list of two integers `[b, x]`, and a list of `q` positive integers `queries`. It returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a query and is determined by the operations applied.**
