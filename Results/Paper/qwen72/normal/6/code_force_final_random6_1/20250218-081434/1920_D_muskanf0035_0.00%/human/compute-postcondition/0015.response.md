Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains two integers provided by the user, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`, `n` and `q` are now the positive integers input by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the `operations` list by reading `n` lines of input, each containing two integers, and storing them as lists within `operations`.
- The value of `n` is used to determine the number of inner lists in `operations`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `queries`, `result`, and `_` remain unchanged except for the update to `operations`.
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1 within the loop, but its value is not explicitly tracked in the output state.
- The initial state conditions for `t`, `n`, `q`, `queries`, `result`, and `_` are still valid after the code has been executed.
