### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires simulating a series of operations on an initially empty array and then answering queries about the `k`-th element of the array.
   - The operations are:
     - Type 1: Append an integer `x` to the array.
     - Type 2: Append `x` copies of the current array to itself.
   - The array can grow very large, and the queries can be up to the size of the array after all operations.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes the number of operations `n`, a list of operations, and a list of queries.
     - It initializes an empty array `array` and an empty list `result` to store the answers to the queries.
     - For each operation:
       - If the operation is of type 1, it appends the value `x` to the array.
       - If the operation is of type 2, it appends only one copy of the current array to itself, which is incorrect. The correct behavior should be to append `x` copies of the current array.
     - After all operations, it processes the queries by appending the `k`-th element of the array to the `result` list. The `k`-th element is found using `(k - 1) % len(array)` to handle the case where `k` is larger than the length of the array.

3. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary for `func_2` is accurate. It correctly describes the input processing and the call to `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Identifying the Error:**
   - The error in `func_1` is in the handling of type 2 operations. The code should append `x` copies of the current array, but it only appends one copy.
   - The correct implementation for type 2 operations should be:
     ```python
     if op_type == 2:
         array.extend(array * value)
     ```

5. **Correcting the Error:**
   - By correcting the type 2 operation handling in `func_1`, the function should correctly simulate the operations and answer the queries.

6. **Checking the Correctness:**
   - After correcting the error, the function `func_1` should correctly simulate the operations and answer the queries.
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case, which is correct.

### Final Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to the handling of type 2 operations.
- The corrected program is correct and should work as expected based on the problem description.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend(array * value)
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)
```

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect. The corrected program is correct.)
