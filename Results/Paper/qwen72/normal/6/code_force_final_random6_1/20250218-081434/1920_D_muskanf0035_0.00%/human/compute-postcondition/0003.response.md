The code snippet reads `n` lines of input, where each line is split into two integers, and these integers are stored in a list of lists called `operations`. The value of `n` is the number of inner lists in `operations`. The values of `t`, `q`, and `queries` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains two integers, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers, `n` is the first integer input, `q` is the second integer input.**
