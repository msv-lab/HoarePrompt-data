### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the operations and queries, storing them in appropriate lists.

2. **Operation Handling:**
   - The `func_1` function processes the operations as described:
     - For an operation of type 1, it appends the integer `x` to the array.
     - For an operation of type 2, it appends `x` copies of the current array to itself. This is done by extending the array with a list comprehension that duplicates the current elements of the array.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - After processing all operations, the function processes the queries:
     - For each query index `k`, it appends the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` to the result list. This ensures that the query index is within the bounds of the array, even if the array is repeated multiple times.

4. **Output:**
   - The `func_2` function prints the results for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Efficiency:**
  - The current implementation of `func_1` is inefficient for large values of `x` in type 2 operations. Specifically, the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` is repeated `x` times, which can lead to very large arrays and high memory usage.
  - For large values of `x` (up to \(10^9\)), the array can grow exponentially, leading to potential memory and performance issues.

- **Correctness:**
  - The program does not handle the case where the array size exceeds \(10^{18}\) as specified in the problem description. The current implementation will continue to grow the array, which is not feasible.
  - The use of `(k - 1) % len(array)` is correct for handling queries, but the array itself should not be grown beyond a certain size. Instead, the program should keep track of the array's structure and use it to efficiently answer queries without actually constructing the large array.

### Conclusion:
The program is **incorrect** because it does not handle large values of `x` in type 2 operations efficiently, leading to potential memory and performance issues. Additionally, it does not ensure that the array size does not exceed \(10^{18}\) as required by the problem constraints.

### Correctness: **False**
