Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains two integers provided by the user, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`, `n` and `q` are now the positive integers input by the user.**

Explanation:
- The value of `result` is assigned the return value of the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.
- The variables `n` and `q` are now the positive integers input by the user, as specified in the initial state.
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `t`.
- All other variables (`t`, `operations`, `queries`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
