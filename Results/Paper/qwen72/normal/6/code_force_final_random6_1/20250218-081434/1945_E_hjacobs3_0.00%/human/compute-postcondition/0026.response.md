Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an array (a permutation of integers from 1 to n) and an integer `find` (1 <= find <= n). It returns a list of two strings: the first string is the smallest index plus 1 where the array value is greater than or equal to `find`, or `n` if no such index exists; the second string is the index of `find` in the array plus 1. Additionally, the function prints `1` if the smallest index `l` such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find` is not the same as the index of `find` in the array, and `0` otherwise. **
