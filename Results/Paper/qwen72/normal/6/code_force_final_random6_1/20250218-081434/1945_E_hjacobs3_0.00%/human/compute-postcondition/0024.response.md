Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed when the `print` statement executes.

### Initial State:
- `array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
- `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= n.
- `n` is the length of `array`.
- `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` >= `find`, or `l` is n if no such index exists.
- `r` is the largest index such that `array[r]` < `find`, or `r` is -1 if no such index exists.
- Additionally, `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`.

### Analysis:
1. **Permutation of Integers from 1 to n**:
   - This means `array` contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once, in some order.
   
2. **`find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= n**:
   - `find` is guaranteed to be one of the elements in `array`.

3. **`l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` >= `find`, or `l` is n if no such index exists**:
   - Since `find` is an element in `array`, there will always be an index `l` where `array[l]` is equal to `find`.
   - Therefore, `l` will be the index of `find` in `array`.

4. **`r` is the largest index such that `array[r]` < `find`, or `r` is -1 if no such index exists**:
   - `r` will be the largest index where the element is less than `find`.
   - If no such index exists, `r` will be -1.

5. **Additionally, `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`**:
   - This confirms that `l` is indeed the index of `find` in `array`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(0)
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement simply prints the integer `0`.
- The values of `array`, `find`, `l`, and `r` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
