You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(' '.join(res))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n - 1)
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
    if l != array.index(find):
        print(1)
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
    else:
        print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an array (a permutation of integers from 1 to n) and an integer `find` (1 <= find <= n). It returns a list of two strings: the first string is the smallest index plus 1 where the array value is greater than or equal to `find`, or `n` if no such index exists; the second string is the index of `find` in the array plus 1. Additionally, the function prints `1` if the smallest index `l` such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find` is not the same as the index of `find` in the array, and `0` otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the binary search and the required swaps to ensure the correct position of the target element `x` after the search. Specifically, the binary search logic and the swap logic are flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
1 2 4 5 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
3 5
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
```

In this case, the permutation is `[1, 2, 4, 5, 3]` and the target element `x` is `3`. The correct position for `3` is at index `2` (0-based index), but the program incorrectly determines that no swaps are needed and returns `0`. This is because the binary search logic in `func_1` is not correctly identifying the position where `3` should be, and the swap logic is not ensuring that the element is in the correct position after the search.

The binary search should be adjusted to correctly handle the case where the target element is found, and the swap logic should ensure that the element is in the correct position after the search. The current implementation does not meet these requirements, leading to incorrect results for some cases.
