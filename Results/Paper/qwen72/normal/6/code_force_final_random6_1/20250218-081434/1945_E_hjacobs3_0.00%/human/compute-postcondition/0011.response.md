Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= n, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is (l + r) // 2, `l` is 0, `r` is (n - 1) // 2 - 1, `r` is now `mid - 1`.** 

In natural language: The `array` remains a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is still an integer between 1 and n, `n` is still the length of the `array`, and `mid` is still calculated as (l + r) // 2. The value of `l` remains 0, but `r` is now updated to `mid - 1`.
