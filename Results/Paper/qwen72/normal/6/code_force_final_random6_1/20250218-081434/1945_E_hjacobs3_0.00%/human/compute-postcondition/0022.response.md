Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the result of converting `l + 1` to a string, where `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`, or `n` if no such index exists; the second string is the result of converting the index of `find` in `array` plus 1 to a string.**
