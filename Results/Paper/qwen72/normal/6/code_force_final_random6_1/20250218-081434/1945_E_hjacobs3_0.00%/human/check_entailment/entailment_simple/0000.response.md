Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `x`, and the permutation array.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_1` is mostly correct, but it has a small issue. The binary search should stop when `r - l == 1`, not when `l <= r`. The condition `l <= r` will cause the loop to continue one step too far, which can lead to incorrect results if the permutation is not sorted.

3. **Finding the Correct Position**: After the binary search, the program checks if the element at position `l` is equal to `x`. If it is, the program prints `0`, indicating no swaps are needed. If not, the program prints `1` and returns the indices to swap the element at position `l` with the element `x` in the array.

4. **Swapping Logic**: The program correctly identifies the index of `x` in the array and swaps it with the element at position `l` if necessary. This ensures that after the swap, the element `x` will be at the correct position for the binary search to find it.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where `x` is at the beginning or end of the array, or when the array is already sorted, correctly.

6. **Output Format**: The output format matches the problem requirements, printing the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps.

However, the binary search logic should be adjusted to stop when `r - l == 1` to avoid potential issues with the loop condition. This is a critical part of the binary search algorithm, especially when dealing with unsorted arrays.

Given the above reasoning, the program is almost correct but has a minor issue in the binary search loop condition. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

To fix the issue, the binary search loop condition should be changed to:

```python
while r - l > 1:
```

This ensures that the loop stops at the correct point, and the rest of the logic remains valid.
