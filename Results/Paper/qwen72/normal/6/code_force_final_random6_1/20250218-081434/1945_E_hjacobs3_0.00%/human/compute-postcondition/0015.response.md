Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= n, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is (l + r) // 2, `l` is 0, `r` is (n - 1) // 2 - 1 if `array[mid]` >= `find`, otherwise `l` is `mid + 1` and `r` is n - 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mid` is updated to `(l + r) // 2`.
- The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged unless the condition `array[mid]` >= `find` is evaluated.
- If `array[mid]` >= `find`, then `r` is updated to `mid - 1`.
- Otherwise, `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `r` remains `n - 1`.
- The initial conditions for `array`, `find`, and `n` remain valid.
