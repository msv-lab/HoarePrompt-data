### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `x`, followed by the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The original function `func_1` performs a binary search on the array. The initial values of `l` and `r` are set to `0` and `n - 1`, which is correct for a 0-indexed array.
   - The loop condition `while l <= r` is also correct for a binary search.
   - The midpoint calculation `mid = (l + r) // 2` is correct.
   - However, the condition `if array[mid] >= find` should be `if array[mid] <= find` to correctly move the `l` pointer when the middle element is less than or equal to `find`. This is a critical error in the binary search logic.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - After the binary search, the program checks if the element at position `l` is equal to `x`. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices to swap the element at position `l` with the element at the position of `x` in the array.
   - This logic is generally correct, but the function should return `None` if no swap is needed, and the main program should handle this by printing `0`.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The original program prints the number of operations and the indices of the swaps, but it does not handle the case where no swaps are needed correctly. The corrected program addresses this by printing `0` when no swaps are needed.
   - The corrected program also ensures that the number of operations is printed before the indices of the swaps.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases where the permutation is already sorted or where the element `x` is at the beginning or end of the array. The current logic, with the corrected binary search condition, should handle these cases correctly.

6. **Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a while loop to process each test case.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment correctly identified the main issues with the binary search condition and the output format. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly for all test cases. Therefore, the original program is indeed incorrect due to the logical error in the binary search condition and the incorrect handling of the output format.

Final: **False**
