Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= n, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is (l + r) // 2, `l` is `mid + 1`, `r` is n - 1.**

Explanation: The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. The other variables (`array`, `find`, `n`, `mid`, and `r`) remain unchanged. The initial condition that `array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= n, and `n` is the length of `array` still holds. The value of `r` is still `n - 1`, and `mid` is still calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
