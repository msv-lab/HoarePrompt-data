Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= n, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `mid` is (n - 1) // 2.**

The code calculates the midpoint `mid` of the range defined by `l` and `r`. Since `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, `mid` is set to the integer division of `(n - 1)` by 2. The values of `array`, `find`, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
