Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= n, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is (l + r) // 2, if `array[mid]` >= `find`, `l` is 0 and `r` is (n - 1) // 2 - 1. Otherwise, `l` is `mid + 1` and `r` is n - 1.** 

The value of `mid` is updated to the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2. The values of `array`, `find`, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
