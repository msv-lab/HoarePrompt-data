Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of finding a number `x` in a permutation `p` using a binary search algorithm, with the possibility of performing up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly. However, the implementation of the binary search and the logic for determining the swaps are flawed, leading to incorrect behavior.

1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search in `func_1` is implemented incorrectly. The condition `if l <= r:` should be `if r - l > 1:` to match the problem description, which states that the loop should end when `r - l = 1`.
   - The binary search logic itself is also flawed. The condition `if array[mid] >= find:` should be `if array[mid] <= find:` to correctly move the search range to the right when the middle element is less than or equal to `find`.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` only prints the number of swaps (0 or 1) but does not actually perform the swaps. The problem requires the program to output the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped, but the function does not handle this correctly.
   - The function also does not handle the case where more than one swap might be necessary to ensure the binary search works correctly.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function `func_1` prints the number of swaps directly, which is not the correct way to handle output in a function. The number of swaps should be returned and then printed outside the function.
   - The function returns a list of strings for the indices to be swapped, but it does not handle the case where no swaps are needed or where more than one swap is needed.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The binary search logic is incorrect, and the swapping logic is incomplete and does not follow the required output format.

Correctness: **False**
