The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array` and `find`. `array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n. The function returns a list containing two strings:
- The first string is the result of converting `l + 1` to a string, where `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`, or `n` if no such index exists.
- The second string is the result of converting the index of `find` in `array` plus 1 to a string.

Functionality: **The function accepts an array (a permutation of integers from 1 to n) and an integer `find` (1 <= find <= n). It returns a list of two strings: the first string is the smallest index plus 1 where the array value is greater than or equal to `find`, or `n` if no such index exists; the second string is the index of `find` in the array plus 1.**
