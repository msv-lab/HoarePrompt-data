Reasoning:  
The function `func` correctly solves the problem as described. The key insight is that the game's outcome can be determined by the parity (even or odd) of the sum of the coins in both wallets. If the sum is even, Bob will win; if the sum is odd, Alice will win. This is because, in each turn, a player can either swap wallets or remove a coin, and the game continues until one player cannot make a move. Since each move reduces the total number of coins by one, the player who starts with an odd total number of coins (Alice, since she goes first) will always be the one to make the last move if the total number of coins is odd, and the player who starts with an even total number of coins will be the one to make the last move if the total number of coins is even.

However, there is a minor issue in the condition used to check the parity of the sum. The expression `a + b & 1` should be `(a + b) & 1` to ensure that the addition is performed before the bitwise AND operation. The bitwise AND operation with 1 checks if the least significant bit of the sum is 1 (odd) or 0 (even).

Despite this minor issue, the logic is correct, and the function will produce the correct output for the given problem. The function correctly handles multiple test cases and reads the inputs as expected.

Correctness: **True** (with a minor syntax correction needed for the condition)
