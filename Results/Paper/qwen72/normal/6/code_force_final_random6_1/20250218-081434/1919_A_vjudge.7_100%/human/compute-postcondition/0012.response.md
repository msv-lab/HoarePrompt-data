Postcondition: ***`func` is expected to take two parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `test` must be an integer such that 1 <= test <= 1000, `t` is 1, and `a` and `b` are input integers. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the state of the variables also remains unchanged.***
