You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters, which is inconsistent with the problem description.
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `func` is expected to take two parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `test` must be an integer such that 1 <= test <= 1000, `t` is `test - 1`, and `a` and `b` are input integers. Regardless of whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd, the state of the variables remains unchanged after all iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program contains a logical error in the condition `if a + b & 1 == 0:`. The bitwise AND operator `&` has higher precedence than the addition operator `+`, so the expression `a + b & 1` is evaluated as `a + (b & 1)`. This is incorrect because the intended logic is to check if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd, which should be written as `(a + b) & 1 == 0`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:
- Input: `a = 1`, `b = 4`
- Expected Output: "Alice"
- Actual Output: "Bob"

In this case, `a + b` is `5`, which is odd. However, the expression `1 + 4 & 1` evaluates to `1 + 0` (since `4 & 1` is `0`), which is `1`. The program incorrectly interprets this as an even number and outputs "Bob" instead of "Alice".

The correct condition should be:
```python
if (a + b) & 1 == 0:
```

This ensures that the sum of `a` and `b` is correctly evaluated for evenness.
