#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters, which is inconsistent with the problem description.
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `func` is expected to take two parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `test` must be an integer such that 1 <= test <= 1000, `t` is `test - 1`, and `a` and `b` are input integers. Regardless of whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd, the state of the variables remains unchanged after all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `test` from the input, representing the number of test cases (1 <= test <= 1000). For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) from the input, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. The function does not return any value, and the state of the input variables remains unchanged after the function concludes.
