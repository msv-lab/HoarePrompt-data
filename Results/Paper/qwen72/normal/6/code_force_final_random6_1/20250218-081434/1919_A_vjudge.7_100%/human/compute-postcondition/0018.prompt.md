Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. The variable `test` is now assigned the value of an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(test):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a + b & 1 == 0:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`func` is expected to take two parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `test` must be an integer such that 1 <= test <= 1000, `t` is 0, and `a` and `b` are input integers. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the program executes the if part. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the program executes the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`func` is expected to take two parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `test` must be an integer such that 1 <= test <= 1000, `t` is 1, and `a` and `b` are input integers. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the state of the variables also remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`func` is expected to take two parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `test` must be an integer such that 1 <= test <= 1000, `t` is 2, and `a` and `b` are input integers. Regardless of whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
