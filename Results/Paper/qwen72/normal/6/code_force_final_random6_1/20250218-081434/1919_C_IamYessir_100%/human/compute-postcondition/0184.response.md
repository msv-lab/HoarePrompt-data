Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` is a list that now includes the first element of `lit`, and if `a` is no longer empty, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `x` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` is a list with one more element than before, which is the first element of `lit`. If `a` was an empty list, `x` is now set to the first element of `lit`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is now the first element of `lit`). If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list with the first element being `lit[0]` and `y` is now `lit[0]`.**
