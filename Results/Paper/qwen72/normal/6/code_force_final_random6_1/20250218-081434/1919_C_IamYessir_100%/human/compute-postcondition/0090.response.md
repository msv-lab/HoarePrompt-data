Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2. If `x` < `y`, then: if `x` ≥ `lit[2]`, `a` is a list that now includes the third element of `lit` (i.e., `lit[2]`), `x` is the last element of `a` (which is now `lit[2]` if `a` was not empty before), and `y` is either infinity (if `b` is empty) or the last element of `b`. If `x` < `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` > `y`, `a` includes the element `lit[2]` at the end, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is now `lit[2]` if `a` was previously empty, or the last element of `a` before the new addition if `a` was not empty), and `y` retains its previous value. If `y` ≥ `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` > `x`, `b` includes the element `lit[2]` at the end, `x` retains its previous value, and `y` is the last element of `b` (which is now `lit[2]` if `b` was previously empty, or the last element of `b` before the new addition if `b` was not empty). Otherwise, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `x` and `y` retain their previous values. If `x` is not less than `y`, the lists `a` and `b` and the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.***
