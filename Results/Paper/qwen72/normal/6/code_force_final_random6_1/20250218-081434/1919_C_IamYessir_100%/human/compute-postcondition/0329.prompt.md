Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is -1, and `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element. `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element. If `b` is an empty list, `x` and `y` are both set to positive infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, and if `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to positive infinity; otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If `x` > `y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `b` is a non-empty list with the last element being `lit[i]`, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` now contains the first element of `lit`. If `lit[i]` is greater than or equal to `x` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `x` is updated to `lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is less than or equal to the new value of `x`, and `a` is a list that now includes the element `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and `x` is greater than `y`, the values of `x` and `a` remain unchanged. If `x` ≤ `y`, and `x` is equal to `y`, `a` now contains the first element of `lit`. If `x` is less than `y` and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `x` is set to the first element of `lit`, and `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and `x` ≤ `y`, `a` is now a list with the first element being `lit[0]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than or equal to `x` and less than or equal to `y`, `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than `x` and `x` ≤ `y`, `b` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element. If `x` > `y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]`, `b` now contains the second element of `lit`, and if `b` is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` > `y`, and `lit[1]` is greater than `y` and `x`, `b` now contains the first element of `lit` (i.e., `lit[1]`), and if `b` is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b` (i.e., `lit[1]`). If `x` > `y`, and `lit[1]` is not greater than `x`, and `lit[1]` is greater than `y`, then `a` now contains the second element of `lit`. If `b` is empty, `y` is set to positive infinity. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to positive infinity. If `a` is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `x` ≤ `y`, and `x` == `y`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `a`, and if `a` was empty, `x` is now `lit[1]`; if `a` was not empty, `x` is now the last element of `a` which is `lit[1]`. If `x` ≤ `y`, and `lit[1]` is greater than or equal to `x`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `a`, and `x` is now the last element of `a`. If `x` ≤ `y`, and `lit[1]` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `b`, and `y` is now the last element of `b`. If `x` ≤ `y`, and `lit[1]` is less than or equal to both `x` and `y`, or if `x` is not less than `y`, the state of `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element. If `x > y`, and `lit[2] > x`, `b` now includes the third element of `lit` (i.e., `lit[2]`), and `y` is updated to `lit[2]`. If `lit[2] <= x` and `lit[2] > y`, `a` now includes the integer `lit[2]` as its last element. If `x <= y`, and `x == y`, `a` now includes the integer `lit[2]` as its last element. If `x < y`, and `x >= lit[2]`, `a` now contains the element `lit[2]` appended to it. If `x < y` and `x < lit[2]` and `lit[2] > y`, `a` now includes the element `lit[2]` as its last element. If `x < y` and `x < lit[2]` and `lit[2] >= y` and `lit[2] > x`, the list `b` now contains the element `lit[2]` at its end. If `x < y` and `x < lit[2]` and `lit[2] <= y`, the list `b` remains unchanged. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
