Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list that has been modified by appending `lit[2]` to it, `b` is a list that may have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body, `x` is either infinity (if `a` is empty) or the last element of `a` (if `a` is not empty), `y` is either infinity (if `b` is empty) or the last element of `b` (if `b` is not empty).**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the third element of `lit` (since `i` is 2) to the list `a`.
- The value of `lit[2]` is added to the end of `a`.
- `x` is now the last element of `a` because `a` is no longer empty (it has at least one element, `lit[2]`).
- The states of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- `y` remains either infinity (if `b` is empty) or the last element of `b` (if `b` is not empty).
