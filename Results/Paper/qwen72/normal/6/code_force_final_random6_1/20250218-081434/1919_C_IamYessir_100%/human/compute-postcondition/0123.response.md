The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to -1, but it will be set to 0 by the loop itself on the first iteration.

For the loop to execute:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` will be set to 0 by the loop on the first iteration, so we do not need to adjust `i`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is -1, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.**
