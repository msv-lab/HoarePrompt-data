Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists that may have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body. If `y` ≥ `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` > `x`, then `b` now includes the element `lit[2]` at the end, `x` is either infinity (if `a` is empty) or the last element of `a` (if `a` is not empty), and `y` is the last element of `b` (which is now `lit[2]` if `b` was previously empty, or the last element of `b` before the new addition if `b` was not empty). Otherwise, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `x` and `y` retain their previous values.***
