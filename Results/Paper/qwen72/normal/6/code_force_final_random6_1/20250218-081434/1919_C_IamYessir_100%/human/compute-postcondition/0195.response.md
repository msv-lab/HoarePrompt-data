Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list with `lit[1]` appended to it, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element, `x` is set to infinity if `a` is an empty list; otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of list `a`, `y` is set to infinity if `b` is an empty list; otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b` which is now `lit[1]`.**
