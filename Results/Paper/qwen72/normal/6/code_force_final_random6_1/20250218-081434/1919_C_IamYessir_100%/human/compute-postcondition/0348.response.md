Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list with at least 3 elements, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element from index 1 to `len(a) - 1`. If `b[i]` > `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1 and the third element of `b` is greater than the second element of `b`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.***
