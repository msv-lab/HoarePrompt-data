Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]` and `lit[1]` is greater than `y`, `a` has one more element than before, which is `lit[1]`, and `x` is now the last element of `a` (which is `lit[1]`). If `b` is empty, `y` remains infinity. If `b` is non-empty, `y` remains the last element of `b`. If `x` is less than `lit[1]` or `lit[1]` is less than or equal to `y`, the variables retain their initial values.***
