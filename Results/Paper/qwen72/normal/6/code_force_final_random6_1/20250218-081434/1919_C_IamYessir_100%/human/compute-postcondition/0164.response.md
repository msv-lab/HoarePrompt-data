Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list, `cp` is 0, `i` is -1, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If `x > y`, and `lit[i]` is greater than or equal to `y`, `b` contains `lit[i]` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x` and greater than `y`, `a` now includes `lit[i]` at its end. If `x <= y`, then `a` now contains the last element of `lit` appended to it. If `x < y` and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` now includes the value at `lit[i]` as its last element, and `x` is set to `lit[i]`, which is still less than `y`. If `x < y` and `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` now includes the value `lit[i]` as its last element, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`. If `x < y` and `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than or equal to `y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `b`, `y` is updated to `lit[i]`, and `x` is still less than `lit[i]`. If none of these conditions hold true, no changes are made to `b` or `y`.**
