The code `b.append(lit[i])` adds the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. This impacts the value of `y`, which is the last element of `b`. The value of `y` will now be updated to `lit[i]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list with `lit[i]` appended, `cp` is 0, `i` is -1, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element, `y` is `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of `a` (or infinity if `a` is empty), `x` is less than `y`, `x < lit[i]` holds true, `lit[i] > y` does not hold true, `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.**
