Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If `x` > `y` and `lit[1]` > `y`, `b` has the second element of `lit` appended to it, and `y` is updated to the last element of `b` (which is `lit[1]`). If `x` > `y` and `lit[1]` ≤ `y`, `x` and `y` remain unchanged. If `x` ≤ `y` and `x` == `y`, `a` has the second element of `lit` appended to it, and `x` is updated to the last element of `a` (which is `lit[1]`). If `x` < `y` and `lit[1]` > `y`, `a` has the second element of `lit` appended to it, and `x` is updated to the last element of `a` (which is `lit[1]`). If `x` < `y` and `lit[1]` ≤ `y`, `x` and `y` remain unchanged. If `a` is empty, `x` is set to infinity. If `b` is empty, `y` is set to infinity.**
