Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `b` is a list with one more element than before, specifically the second element of `lit` is appended to `b`. If `b` is non-empty, `y` is the last element of `b` (which is now the second element of `lit`). If `a` is empty, `x` is set to infinity. If `a` is non-empty, `x` is the last element of `a`.**
