Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is non-empty, otherwise `y` is infinity.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `a` to the variable `x`.
- The initial state specifies that `x` is set to the last element of `a` if `a` is non-empty, otherwise it is set to infinity.
- The value of `y` remains the same as described in the initial state: if `b` is non-empty, `y` is the last element of `b`; otherwise, `y` is infinity.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet and remain the same as in the initial state.
