Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` and `b` are lists that have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `b` must have at least 2 elements, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.**

Explanation:
- The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `lit`.
- The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The only change is that `lit` is now a list of integers provided by the user.
