Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is -1, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list, `cp` is 0, `i` is -1, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If `x > y`, and `lit[i]` is greater than or equal to `y`, `b` contains `lit[i]` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x` and greater than `y`, `a` now includes `lit[i]` at its end. If `x <= y`, then `a` now contains the last element of `lit` appended to it. If `x < y` and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` now includes the value at `lit[i]` as its last element, and `x` is set to `lit[i]`, which is still less than `y`. If `x < y` and `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` now includes the value `lit[i]` as its last element, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`. If `x < y` and `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than or equal to `y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `b`, `y` is updated to `lit[i]`, and `x` is still less than `lit[i]`. If none of these conditions hold true, no changes are made to `b` or `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, and `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. If `x > y`, then: If `y >= lit[i]`, `b` is a list with the first element being `lit[0]`, and `y` is the last element of `b`, which is `lit[0]`. If `y < lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `b` is a list with the first element being `lit[0]`, and `y` is the last element of `b`, which is now `lit[0]`. If `y < lit[i]` and `lit[i] <= x`, `a` is a list with the first element being `lit[0]` if `lit[0] > y`, and `x` is set to `lit[0]`. If `lit[0] <= y`, `a` remains an empty list, and `x` is set to infinity. If `x <= y`, then: If `x` equals `y`, `a` now contains the first element of `lit`, and `x` is the first element of `lit`. If `x` is less than `y`, then: If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` now includes the first element of `lit`, and `x` is the first element of `lit`. If `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` is a list with one more element, which is the first element of `lit`, and `x` is now the first element of `lit`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list with the first element being `lit[0]`, and `y` is now `lit[0]`. If `x` is not less than `y` and `x` does not equal `y`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. If `x` (the last element of `a` or infinity if `a` is empty) is greater than `y` (the last element of `b` or infinity if `b` is empty), then: if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]`, `lit[1]` is appended to `b`, `y` is set to `lit[1]`, and `s` is updated accordingly; if `y` is less than `lit[1]` and `lit[1] > x`, `lit[1]` is appended to `b`, and `y` is set to `lit[1]`; if `y` is less than `lit[1]` and `lit[1] <= x` and `lit[1] > y`, `a` includes `lit[1]`, and `x` is set to `lit[1]`; if `y` is less than `lit[1]` and `lit[1] <= x` and `lit[1] <= y`, `a` and `x` remain unchanged. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then: if `x` is equal to `y`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `a`, and `x` is set to the last element of `a`; if `x` is less than `y` and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]`, then `lit[1]` is appended to `a`, and `x` is set to `lit[1]`; if `x` is less than `y` and `lit[1]` is greater than `y`, then `lit[1]` is appended to `a`, and `x` is set to `lit[1]`; if `x` is less than `y` and `lit[1]` is greater than `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]`, then `lit[1]` is appended to `b`, and `y` is set to `lit[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
