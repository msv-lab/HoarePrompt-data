To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are directly involved in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(1, len(a)):
```

The variables and objects in the loop head are:
- `i`
- `a` (since `len(a)` is used to determine the range)

Let's analyze the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is equal to `t`
- `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `a` and `b` are lists that have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is `t - 1`
- `s` is 0

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`. The initial value of `i` is `t - 1`. However, the loop head requires `i` to start from 1. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1 for the loop to execute.
2. **List `a`**: The loop will execute if `len(a)` is greater than 1. This is because the range `range(1, len(a))` will generate a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `len(a) - 1`. If `len(a)` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` must be 1 for the loop to start.
- `a` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute.

The other variables and objects (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `cp`, `s`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` and `b` are lists that have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `a` must have at least 2 elements**
