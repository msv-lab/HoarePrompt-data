Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list with the first element being `lit[0]`, `x` is equal to `lit[0]` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a` before the execution, and `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is non-empty, otherwise `y` is infinity. `x` is less than or equal to `y`, and `x` is equal to `y`.**
