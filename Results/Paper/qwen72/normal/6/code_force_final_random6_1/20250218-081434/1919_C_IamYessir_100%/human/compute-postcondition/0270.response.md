The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is greater than 0
- `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is 0
- `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element
- If `b` is an empty list, `x` and `y` are both set to positive infinity
- Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, and if `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to positive infinity; otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`
- `x` is less than `y`
- The current value of `x` is greater than or equal to the first element of `lit`

Impact of the code:
- The element at index `i` (which is 0) of `lit` is appended to the list `a`.
- The list `a` now contains one element, which is the first element of `lit`.

Output State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is greater than 0
- `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is 0
- `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element
- If `b` is an empty list, `x` and `y` are both set to positive infinity
- Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `x` is set to the first element of `lit` (since `a` now contains this element)
- `x` is less than `y`
- The current value of `x` is the first element of `lit`

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element, if `b` is an empty list, `x` and `y` are both set to positive infinity, otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `x` is the first element of `lit`, `x` is less than `y`, the current value of `x` is the first element of `lit`, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`.**
