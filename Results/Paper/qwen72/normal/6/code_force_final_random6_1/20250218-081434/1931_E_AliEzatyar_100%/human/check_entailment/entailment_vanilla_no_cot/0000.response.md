Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros. The program incorrectly assumes that the number of trailing zeros in a number can be subtracted from the total number of digits in a way that directly impacts the game's outcome. However, this is not a valid approach to determine the winner of the game.

### Explanation of the Issues:

1. **Total Digits Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list by summing the lengths of the string representations of the numbers. This is correct.

2. **Trailing Zeros Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a number.
   - However, the program then subtracts the number of trailing zeros in pairs from the total number of digits. This is incorrect because the game's rules do not allow for the removal of trailing zeros in this manner. The trailing zeros are part of the number and can only be removed if the number is reversed and the leading zeros are then removed.

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between the total number of digits and the subtracted trailing zeros is greater than or equal to \(10^m\). This is not a valid way to determine the winner.
   - The correct approach should consider the optimal moves for both players and the resulting number after all possible moves.

### Correct Approach:

To determine the winner, we need to consider the following:

- **Anna's Move**: Anna can reverse any number, which might change the number of digits in that number.
- **Sasha's Move**: Sasha can concatenate any two numbers, which will always increase the number of digits in the list.
- **Winning Condition**: Sasha wins if the final number has at least \(10^m\) digits. Otherwise, Anna wins.

### Steps to Correct the Program:

1. **Reverse the Numbers**: Anna can reverse any number, which might reduce the number of digits if the number has trailing zeros.
2. **Concatenate the Numbers**: Sasha will always concatenate the two largest numbers to maximize the number of digits.
3. **Check the Final Number**: After all moves, check if the final number has at least \(10^m\) digits.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def reverse_number(num):
    return int(str(num)[::-1])

def can_sasha_win(n, m, array):
    # Reverse all numbers in the array
    reversed_array = [reverse_number(int(num)) for num in array]
    
    # Sort the array in descending order
    reversed_array.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Concatenate all numbers to form the final number
    final_number = int(''.join(map(str, reversed_array)))
    
    # Check if the final number has at least 10^m digits
    return final_number >= 10**m

n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    if can_sasha_win(n, m, array):
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

- **Reverse the Numbers**: The `reverse_number` function reverses the digits of a number and converts it back to an integer.
- **Concatenate the Numbers**: The program sorts the reversed numbers in descending order and concatenates them to form the final number.
- **Check the Final Number**: The program checks if the final number has at least \(10^m\) digits to determine the winner.

This approach correctly simulates the game and determines the winner based on the optimal play for both players.
