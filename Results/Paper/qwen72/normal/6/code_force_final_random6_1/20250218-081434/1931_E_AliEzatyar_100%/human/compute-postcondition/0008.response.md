Output State: **`num` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 2 · 10^5, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, `counter` is 2, and the second last element of `num` is '0'.** 

The value of `counter` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The other conditions remain unchanged: `num` is still a list of integers with the specified length, `i` is still `len(num) - 2`, and the second last element of `num` is still '0'.
