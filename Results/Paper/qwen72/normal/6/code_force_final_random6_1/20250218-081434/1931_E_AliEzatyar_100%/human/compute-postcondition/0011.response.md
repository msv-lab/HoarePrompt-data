The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `num`. The loop iterates in reverse, starting from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(num) - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 to `len(num) - 3`, and `num` must still have at least 2 elements to ensure the loop can continue.

Given that `i` is `len(num) - 2` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `len(num) - 3`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`. Therefore, `len(num) - 3` must be greater than or equal to `0`, which means `len(num)` must be greater than or equal to `3`.

The state of `counter` and the specific value of the second last element of `num` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`num` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 2 · 10^5, `i` is `len(num) - 3`, `counter` is 2 if the second last element of `num` is '0', otherwise `counter` is 0, and `len(num)` must be greater than or equal to 3**
