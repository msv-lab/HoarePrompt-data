### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - It initializes an array `answers` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the threshold `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `array`.

2. **Digit Counting and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list `array` by summing the lengths of the string representations of the integers.
   - It uses a function `func_1` to count the number of trailing zeros in each integer and stores these counts in the list `zeros`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a string representation of an integer `num` and counts the number of trailing zeros.
   - It iterates from the end of the string to the beginning, incrementing a counter for each trailing zero until it encounters a non-zero digit.
   - The function returns the count of trailing zeros.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program sorts the list `zeros` in descending order.
   - It then calculates the total number of digits to subtract by summing every second element in the sorted `zeros` list.
   - The idea is to maximize the number of digits removed by Sasha, which is done by removing the largest possible number of trailing zeros in pairs.

5. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between the total number of digits and the number of digits to subtract is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If the condition is met, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Issues:
- **Function `func_1` Misuse:**
  - The function `func_1` is designed to count trailing zeros in a single integer, but it is being called with each element of the `array` as a string.
  - The function should be called with each integer as a string, not as a list of integers.

- **Trailing Zeros Calculation:**
  - The function `func_1` is correctly counting trailing zeros, but the program is not correctly handling the list of integers.
  - The function should be applied to each integer in the list, and the results should be stored in `zeros`.

- **Optimal Play Strategy:**
  - The strategy of summing every second element in the sorted `zeros` list is not optimal for determining the winner.
  - The correct approach should consider the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros in a more strategic manner.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if total_digits - subtract_zero >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter
```

### Correctness:
- **True**: The program correctly parses the input and applies the function `func_1` to count trailing zeros in each integer.
- **False**: The strategy for determining the winner is not optimal. The program should consider the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros in a more strategic manner to ensure the correct winner is determined.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
