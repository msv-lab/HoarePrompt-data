Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has been modified such that each element `nums[i]` is reduced by the sum of all previous elements in the list, `nums` must have at least 3 elements, `ls` is equal to the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, `nw` is the same as the value of `cw` before the code execution, and `cw` is the same as the value of `nw` before the code execution.**

Explanation:
- The code `nw = cw` assigns the value of `cw` to `nw`.
- Since `nw` is set to the same value as `cw` before the code execution, `cw` and `nw` are now the same.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `N`, `nums`, `ls`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that if `nums[i]` is 1, `cw` is the opposite of `nw` is not affected by this code snippet, so it remains valid.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new value of `nw` being the same as `cw`.
