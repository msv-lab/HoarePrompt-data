Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has been modified such that each element `nums[i]` is reduced by the sum of all previous elements in the list, `nums` must have at least 3 elements, `ls` is equal to the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, `nw` is the same as the value of `cw` before the code execution. If `nums[i]` is 1, `cw` is the opposite of `nw` (i.e., if `nw` was True, `cw` is now False, and if `nw` was False, `cw` is now True). Otherwise, `cw` is True.***
