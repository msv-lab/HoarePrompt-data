Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has been modified such that each element `nums[i]` is reduced by the sum of all previous elements in the list, `nums` must have at least 3 elements, `ls` is equal to the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, `nw` is True, and if `nums[i]` is 1, `cw` is False. Otherwise, `cw` is True and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1.***
