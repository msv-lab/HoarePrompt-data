Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and must have at least 2 elements, `ls` is equal to the first element of `nums`, `i` is 1, `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - ls`.**

The value of `nums[1]` has been updated to be the original value of `nums[1]` minus the value of `ls`, which is the first element of `nums`. All other variables remain unchanged.
