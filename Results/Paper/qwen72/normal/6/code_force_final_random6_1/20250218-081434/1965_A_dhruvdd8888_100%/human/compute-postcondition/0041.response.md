Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `N` from the input, which represents the number of elements in a set of integers. It then reads a line of space-separated integers, converts them to a set, adds '0' to the set, and sorts the resulting integers. The function modifies this sorted list such that each element is reduced by the sum of all previous elements in the list. After this modification, the function determines a winner between 'Alice' and 'Bob' based on the modified list, and prints the name of the winner. The function does not return any value and does not modify the `test_cases` list. **
