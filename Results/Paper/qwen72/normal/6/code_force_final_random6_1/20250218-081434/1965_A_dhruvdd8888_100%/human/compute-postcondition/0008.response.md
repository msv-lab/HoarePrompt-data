The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and must have at least 1 element.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- `nums` must still have at least 1 element for the loop to potentially execute again, but since `i` is now 1, `nums` must have at least 2 elements.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and must have at least 2 elements, `ls` is equal to the first element of `nums`, `i` is 1**
