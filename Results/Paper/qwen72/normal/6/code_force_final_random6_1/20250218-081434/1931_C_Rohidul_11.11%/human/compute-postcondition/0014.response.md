Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers where the first `l` elements are all equal, `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous one or `r` if all elements up to `r` are equal, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is `l`, `end` is 0.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the variable `l` will be the index of the first element in the list `a` that is not equal to its preceding element. If all elements up to the index `r` (which is `n - 1`) are equal, `l` will be equal to `r`. The variable `st` will also be equal to `l`, and `end` remains 0. The initial conditions for `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
