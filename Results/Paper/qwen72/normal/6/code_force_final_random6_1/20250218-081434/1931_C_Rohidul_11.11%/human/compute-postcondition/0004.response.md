Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0.**

The variables `st` and `end` are both assigned the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `a` still being a list of integers, `l` remaining 0, and `r` remaining `n - 1`.
