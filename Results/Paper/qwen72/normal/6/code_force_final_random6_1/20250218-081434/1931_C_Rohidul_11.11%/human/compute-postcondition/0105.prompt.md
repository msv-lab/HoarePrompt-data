Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should accept two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n. The function should be designed to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    st, end = 0, 0
    while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
        l += 1
        st += 1
    while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
        r -= 1
        end += 1
    if a[0] == a[-1]:
        ans = r - l - 1
    elif st == 0 and end == 0 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        ans = len(a) - 1
    else:
        ans = r - l
    print(max(0, ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers where the first `l` elements are all equal and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` for all `r` from `n - 1` down to `l + 1`, `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous one or `r` if all elements up to `r` are equal, `r` is `l`, `st` is `l`, `end` is `n - l - 1`. If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `0`. If `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and `st == 0` and `end == 0`, then `ans` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a[l-1]` must be equal to `a[l]` for all `l` from 0 to the final value of `l-1`, `l` is the smallest index such that `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l+1]` or `l` is equal to `r` and `l` must be less than or equal to `r`, `r` is the largest index such that `a[r]` is equal to `a[r-1]` and `r` must be greater than or equal to `l`, `st` is the final value of `l`, `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal to the element before them, `ans` is `r - l - 1` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`. If the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `r - l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to the next element, and `end` is the number of times the loop executed. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, if `st` is 0 and `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. In all other cases, `ans` is `r - l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
