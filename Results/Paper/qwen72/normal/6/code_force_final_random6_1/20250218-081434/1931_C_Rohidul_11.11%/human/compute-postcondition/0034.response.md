Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided to determine the value of `ans` and what will be printed by the `print(max(0, ans))` statement.

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
- `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive.
- `a` is a list of integers where:
  - The first `l` elements are all equal.
  - `a[r] == a[r - 1]` for all `r` from `n - 1` down to `l + 1`.
  - `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous one or `r` if all elements up to `r` are equal.
  - `r` is `l`.
  - `st` is `l`.
  - `end` is `n - l - 1`.
- If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `0`.
- If `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and `st == 0` and `end == 0`, then `ans` is `n - 1`.
- Otherwise, `ans` is `0`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `l` and `r`:**
   - `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous one or `r` if all elements up to `r` are equal.
   - `r` is `l`.

2. **Determine `st` and `end`:**
   - `st` is `l`.
   - `end` is `n - l - 1`.

3. **Evaluate the conditions for `ans`:**
   - **Condition 1:** If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `0`.
   - **Condition 2:** If `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and `st == 0` and `end == 0`, then `ans` is `n - 1`.
   - **Condition 3:** Otherwise, `ans` is `0`.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **Scenario 1: `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`**
   - In this case, `ans` is `0`.
   - The `print(max(0, ans))` statement will print `0`.

2. **Scenario 2: `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and `st == 0` and `end == 0`**
   - If `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and `st == 0` and `end == 0`, then `ans` is `n - 1`.
   - The `print(max(0, ans))` statement will print `n - 1`.

3. **Scenario 3: `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and either `st != 0` or `end != 0`**
   - In this case, `ans` is `0`.
   - The `print(max(0, ans))` statement will print `0`.

### Conclusion:
- If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, `ans` is `0` and the output will be `0`.
- If `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and `st == 0` and `end == 0`, `ans` is `n - 1` and the output will be `n - 1`.
- Otherwise, `ans` is `0` and the output will be `0`.

Given the conditions, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **0 or n - 1 (where n is the length of the list `a` and `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and `st == 0` and `end == 0`)**
