Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `a`. The initial state variables `_` and `n` remain unchanged.
