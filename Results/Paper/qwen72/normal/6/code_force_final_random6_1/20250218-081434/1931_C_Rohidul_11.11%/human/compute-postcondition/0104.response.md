Let's break down the initial state and the logic to determine what will be printed by the `print(max(0, ans))` statement.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element.
- `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to the next element.
- `end` is the number of times the loop executed.
- If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`.
- Otherwise, if `st` is 0 and `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.
- In all other cases, `ans` is `r - l`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `ans` based on the given conditions:**
   - **Case 1:** If `a[0] == a[-1]` (the first element is equal to the last element):
     - `ans` is calculated as `r - l - 1`.
   - **Case 2:** If `st == 0` and `a[0] != a[-1]`:
     - `ans` is calculated as `len(a) - 1`.
   - **Case 3:** In all other cases:
     - `ans` is calculated as `r - l`.

2. **Evaluate `max(0, ans)`:**
   - The `max(0, ans)` function will return the maximum of 0 and `ans`.
   - If `ans` is negative, `max(0, ans)` will return 0.
   - If `ans` is non-negative, `max(0, ans)` will return `ans`.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1:** If `a[0] == a[-1]`:
  - `ans = r - l - 1`.
  - If `r - l - 1` is non-negative, `max(0, ans)` will return `r - l - 1`.
  - If `r - l - 1` is negative, `max(0, ans)` will return 0.

- **Scenario 2:** If `st == 0` and `a[0] != a[-1]`:
  - `ans = len(a) - 1`.
  - Since `len(a) - 1` is always non-negative (because `n > 2` and `len(a) >= n`), `max(0, ans)` will return `len(a) - 1`.

- **Scenario 3:** In all other cases:
  - `ans = r - l`.
  - If `r - l` is non-negative, `max(0, ans)` will return `r - l`.
  - If `r - l` is negative, `max(0, ans)` will return 0.

### Final Output:
- **If `a[0] == a[-1]`:**
  - Output: **max(0, r - l - 1)**
- **If `st == 0` and `a[0] != a[-1]`:**
  - Output: **len(a) - 1**
- **In all other cases:**
  - Output: **max(0, r - l)**

Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, and `st` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **max(0, ans) (where ans is determined by the conditions provided in the initial state)**
