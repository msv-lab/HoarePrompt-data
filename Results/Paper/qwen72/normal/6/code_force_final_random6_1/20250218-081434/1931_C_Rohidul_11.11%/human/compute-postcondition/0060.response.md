Postcondition: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and `a[l-1]` must be equal to `a[l]` for all `l` from 0 to the final value of `l-1`, `l` is the smallest index such that `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l+1]` or `l` is equal to `r` and `l` must be less than or equal to `r`, `r` is the largest index such that `a[r]` is equal to `a[r-1]` and `r` must be greater than or equal to `l`, `st` is the final value of `l`, `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal to the element before them, `ans` is 0, and the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**
