Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to the next element, `end` is 0, `ans` is `len(a) - 1`, the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`, `st` is 0, `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`.**

The value of `ans` is updated to `len(a) - 1`, which is the length of the list `a` minus 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
