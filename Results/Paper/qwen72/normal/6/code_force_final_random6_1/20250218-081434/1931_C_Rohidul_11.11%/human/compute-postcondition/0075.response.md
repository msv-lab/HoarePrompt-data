To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

The loop condition is:
```
while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Condition**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `l`, `r`, and `a`.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.

3. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - `l < r`: This condition checks if `l` is less than `r`.
   - `a[l] == a[l + 1]`: This condition checks if the element at index `l` is equal to the element at index `l + 1`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For `l < r` to be true, `r` must be greater than `l`. Since `l` is 0, `r` must be greater than 0.
   - For `a[l] == a[l + 1]` to be true, the first element of `a` (at index 0) must be equal to the second element of `a` (at index 1).

### Conclusion:
- `r` must be greater than 0.
- The first element of `a` must be equal to the second element of `a`.

### Final State:
State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` and `r` must be greater than 0, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, `ans` is `r - l - 1` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`. If the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `r - l`. Additionally, the first element of `a` must be equal to the second element of `a`.**
