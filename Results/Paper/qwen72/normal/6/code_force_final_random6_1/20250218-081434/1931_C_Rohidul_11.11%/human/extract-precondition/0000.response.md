Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n. The function should be designed to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def min_burles_to_equalize(a, n):
```

With the correct precondition:

Precondition: **a is a list of integers of length n, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n.**
