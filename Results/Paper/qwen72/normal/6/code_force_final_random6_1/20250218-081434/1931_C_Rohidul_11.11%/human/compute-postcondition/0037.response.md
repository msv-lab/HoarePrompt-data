The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. This updates the value of `a` but does not affect the other variables. The new value of `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous one or `r` if all elements up to `r` are equal, `r` is `l`, `st` is `l`, `end` is `n - l - 1`. If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `0`. If `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and `st == 0` and `end == 0`, then `ans` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `0`.**
