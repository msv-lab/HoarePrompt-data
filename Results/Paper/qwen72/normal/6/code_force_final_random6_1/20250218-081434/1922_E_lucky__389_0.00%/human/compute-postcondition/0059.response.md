Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the largest integers `i` such that \(2^i - 1\) can be subtracted from the initial `x - 1` without making `x` negative, `i` is 3, `mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop execution, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx - 1` with the elements `subseq_lens[1]`, `subseq_lens[2]`, and `subseq_lens[3]` appended to it, and `subseq_lens[i]` is now appended to `ansv`.**

In natural language: The value of `x` remains 0. The list `subseq_lens` is unchanged. The value of `i` remains 3. The value of `mx` remains the maximum value of `i` found during the loop execution. The list `ansv` now includes the elements from 0 to `mx - 1` and has `subseq_lens[3]` appended to it.
