Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is 0.
   - `subseq_lens` is a list containing at least two elements.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `mx` must be at least 1.
   - `ansv` is a list containing at least one element.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(ansv[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement is printing the element at index `i` of the list `ansv`.
   - According to the initial state, `i` is 0.
   - Therefore, `ansv[i]` will be `ansv[0]`, which is the first element of the list `ansv`.

4. **Output:**
   - The first element of the list `ansv` will be printed.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

Output: **[ansv[0]] (where ansv[0] is the first element of the list ansv)**
