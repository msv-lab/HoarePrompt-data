Output State: **`x` is an input integer and `x` is now `x - 1` (which is at least 1), `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value of `i`, `mx` is 0, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq x + 1\), and `i` is not equal to 0.**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `subseq_lens`, which was initially empty. The value of `x` remains `x - 1` (at least 1), `mx` remains 0, and `i` remains the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq x + 1\), and `i` is not equal to 0.
