Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `x` is 0.
- `subseq_lens` is a list containing at least two elements.
- `i` is 1.
- `mx` must be at least 1.
- `ansv` is a list containing at least two elements.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ansv[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The value of `i` is given as 1.
2. **List `ansv`**: The list `ansv` is described as containing at least two elements. Since `i` is 1, the code will print the second element of the list `ansv`.
3. **`end=' '`**: The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function means that the output will be followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Output:
The code will print the second element of the list `ansv` followed by a space.

Output: **ansv[1] (where ansv[1] is the second element of the list ansv)**
