Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is 0.
- `subseq_lens` is a list containing at least two elements.
- `i` is 2.
- `mx` must be at least 1.
- `ansv` is a list containing at least three elements.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(ansv[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Identify the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.

2. **Determine the value of `ansv[i]`:**
   - `ansv` is a list containing at least three elements.
   - Since `i` is 2, `ansv[i]` refers to the third element in the list `ansv`.

3. **Understanding the `end=' '` parameter:**
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function means that the output will be followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print the third element of the list `ansv` followed by a space.

Output: **[ansv[2]] (where ansv[2] is the third element of the list ansv)**
