Output State: **`x` is an input integer and `x` is now `x - 1` (which is at least 1 and must be at least \(2^{i} - 2\)), `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and `i` is 1**

The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. The other variables (`x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx`) remain unchanged.
