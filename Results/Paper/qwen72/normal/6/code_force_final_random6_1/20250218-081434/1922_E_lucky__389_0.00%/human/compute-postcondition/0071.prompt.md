You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array, if it exists, should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the largest integers `i` such that \(2^i - 1\) can be subtracted from the initial `x - 1` without making `x` negative, and `mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop execution.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the largest integers `i` such that \(2^i - 1\) can be subtracted from the initial `x - 1` without making `x` negative, `i` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`, `mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop execution, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx - 1` with the elements `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens) - 1]` appended to it.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 0
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing at least two elements, `i` is `len(ansv) - 1`, `mx` must be at least 1, `ansv` is a list containing all the elements from 0 to `mx - 1` followed by the elements `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens) - 1]`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a blank line)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) and returns an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array, if it exists, are within the range [-10^9, 10^9].

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
