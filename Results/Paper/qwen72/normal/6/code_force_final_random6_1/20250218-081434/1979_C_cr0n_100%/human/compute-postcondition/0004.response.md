The code snippet `den = func_1(den, x)` updates the value of `den` by calling the function `func_1` with `den` and `x` as arguments. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact output value of `den`. However, we can state that `den` is now the result of `func_1(den, x)`.

Output State: **N is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers where each element is a multiplier (k_i) for the i-th outcome, such that 1 <= N <= 50 and 2 <= vals[i] <= 20 for all 0 <= i < N, `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)`, `x` is the first element of `vals`.**
