### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, the amount received is `k_i * x_i`, where `k_i` is the multiplier and `x_i` is the bet on that outcome.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is: `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(a, b)`:**
     - This function computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`.
     - It is used to find a common multiple of all multipliers in `vals`.

   - **`func_2()`:**
     - **Input Reading:**
       - `N` is the number of outcomes.
       - `vals` is a list of multipliers for each outcome.
     - **LCM Calculation:**
       - `den` is initialized to the first element of `vals`.
       - The LCM of `den` and each element in `vals` is computed and stored back in `den`.
       - After the loop, `den` will be the LCM of all elements in `vals`.
     - **Bet Calculation:**
       - `vprod` is a list where each element is `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`.
       - This ensures that the bet on each outcome is a multiple of the LCM divided by the corresponding multiplier.
     - **Total Bet Calculation:**
       - `den` is updated to `den - sum(vprod)`.
       - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it means the total bet is not strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome, so the function prints `-1` and returns.
     - **Output:**
       - If `den` is greater than 0, the function prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **LCM Calculation:**
     - The LCM of all multipliers ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the total amount bet is a common multiple of all multipliers.
   - **Bet Calculation:**
     - Each bet `x_i` is `den // k_i`, which ensures that the amount received for any winning outcome is `k_i * (den // k_i) = den`.
   - **Total Bet Check:**
     - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i) = sum(den // k_i)`.
     - The condition `sum(x_i) < den` must hold true for the solution to be valid.
     - If `den - sum(x_i) <= 0`, it means the total bet is not strictly less than `den`, and the function correctly prints `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All Multipliers are the Same:**
     - If all `k_i` are the same, the LCM will be that value, and the total bet will be `N * (den // k_i)`, which will be equal to `den` if `N > 1`. Hence, the function correctly prints `-1`.
   - **Different Multipliers:**
     - If the multipliers are different, the LCM will be a larger value, and the total bet will be less than `den` as long as the multipliers are not too small relative to `N`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of coins for the given problem. It correctly handles edge cases and ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

**Correctness: True**
