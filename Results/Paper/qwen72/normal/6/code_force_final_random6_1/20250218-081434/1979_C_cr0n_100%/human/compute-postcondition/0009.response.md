Output State: **N is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers where each element is a multiplier (k_i) for the i-th outcome, such that 1 <= N <= 50 and 2 <= vals[i] <= 20 for all 0 <= i < N, `den` is the result of applying `func_1` to the initial value of `den` and each element of `vals` in sequence.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `N` and the list `vals` remain unchanged. The variable `den` will have been updated by applying the function `func_1` to the initial value of `den` and each element of `vals` in the order they appear in the list. The final value of `den` will be the cumulative result of these function applications.
