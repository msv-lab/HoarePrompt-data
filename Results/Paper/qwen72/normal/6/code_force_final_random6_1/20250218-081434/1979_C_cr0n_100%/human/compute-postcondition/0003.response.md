The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `vals`. For the loop to execute, `vals` must have at least one element. Given the state before the loop, `vals` is a list of integers where each element is a multiplier, and the variable `den` is now equal to the first element of the list `vals`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `vals` has at least one element, and `x` is set to the first element of `vals`.

State: **N is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers where each element is a multiplier (k_i) for the i-th outcome, such that 1 <= N <= 50 and 2 <= vals[i] <= 20 for all 0 <= i < N, `den` is equal to the first element of the list `vals`, `x` is the first element of `vals`**
