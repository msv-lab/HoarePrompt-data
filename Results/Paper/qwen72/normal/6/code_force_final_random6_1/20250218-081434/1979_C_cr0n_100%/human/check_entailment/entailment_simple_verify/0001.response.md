### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to distribute coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is: `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i` to find a common denominator.
   - The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets `x_i` are such that the total amount bet `sum(x_i)` is a common multiple of the multipliers `k_i`.

3. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**
   - This function correctly calculates the LCM of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula: `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) // GCD(a, b)`.
   - The function is mathematically sound and works as expected.

4. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - The function reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
   - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier `vals[0]`.
   - It iterates through all multipliers and updates `den` to be the LCM of `den` and the current multiplier `x`.
   - After calculating the LCM, it computes `vprod` as the list of `den // r` for each multiplier `r` in `vals`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(vprod)`.
   - It checks if `den - sum(vprod) > 0` to ensure that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - If the condition is met, it prints the bets `vprod`.
   - If the condition is not met, it prints `-1`.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The LCM approach ensures that the bets `x_i` are such that the total amount bet `sum(x_i)` is a common multiple of the multipliers `k_i`.
   - By using `den // r` as the bet for each outcome, we ensure that the amount received back for any winning outcome is `k_i * (den // r)`, which is a multiple of `den`.
   - The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - If `den - sum(vprod) <= 0`, it means there is no way to distribute the coins as required, and the function correctly prints `-1`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where there is no valid distribution of coins by checking if `den - sum(vprod) <= 0`.
   - The function also handles the case where the multipliers are all the same, which is a special case where the LCM is the same as the multiplier.

7. **Annotated Code Evaluation:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points.
   - The LCM calculation is performed correctly, and the bets are computed as `den // r`.
   - The final check `den - sum(vprod) > 0` is a valid way to ensure the condition is met.
   - The program prints the bets if the condition is met, and `-1` otherwise.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the LCM approach to find a valid distribution of coins and checks the necessary condition to ensure the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

Final: **True**
