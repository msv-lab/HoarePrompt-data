Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking a specific condition: whether the arrow in the cell (2, n-1) points to the left ('<'). If it does, the program concludes that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n) and prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

However, this approach is overly simplistic and does not fully capture the complexity of the problem. The robot's movement is influenced by both the arrows in the current cell and the arrows in the cells it moves to. The robot can move left, right, up, or down, and then it must follow the arrow in the cell it lands on. Therefore, the robot's ability to reach (2, n) depends on a more intricate sequence of movements and the configuration of arrows in the grid.

To correctly determine if the robot can reach (2, n), we need to simulate the robot's movements from (1, 1) to (2, n) while considering the arrows in each cell. The program should check if there is any sequence of moves that allows the robot to reach the target cell.

The current program only checks the arrow in the cell (2, n-1), which is not sufficient to determine the robot's ability to reach (2, n). For example, consider the following test case:

```
4
>>><
>><<
```

In this case, the robot can reach (2, 4) by the following path: (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (1, 3) → (2, 3) → (2, 4). However, the current program would print "No" because the arrow in (2, 3) points to the left.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not simulate the robot's movements and only checks a single condition that is not sufficient to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
