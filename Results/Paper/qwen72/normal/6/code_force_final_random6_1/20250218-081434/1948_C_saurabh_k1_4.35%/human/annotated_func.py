#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept three parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even) representing the number of columns in each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. For each test case, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` and `b` are lists of strings where each string is a character from the input string. The variable `_` has been incremented by 1 for each iteration, and the final value of `_` is equal to the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, if the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, the output "No" was printed. Otherwise, the output "Yes" was printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the user for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of columns, and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function then checks if the character at the second-to-last position in `b` is '<'. If it is, the function prints "No"; otherwise, it prints "Yes". After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
