Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input string, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input string, if the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is not the string `"<"`. `_` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `_`.**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer.
- The new value of `n` is still an integer greater than 0.
- The other variables `a`, `b`, and `_` are not affected by this code.
- The condition about the element at index `n - 2` in `b` being `"<"` or not remains unchanged.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than `_` still holds.
