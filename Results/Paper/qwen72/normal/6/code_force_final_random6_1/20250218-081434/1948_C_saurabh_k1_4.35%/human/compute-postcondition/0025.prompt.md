You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept three parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even) representing the number of columns in each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. For each test case, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` and `b` are lists of strings where each string is a character from the input string. The variable `_` has been incremented by 1 for each iteration, and the final value of `_` is equal to the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, if the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, the output "No" was printed. Otherwise, the output "Yes" was printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of integers `n` representing the number of columns in each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function returns a list of results, each indicating "Yes" if it is possible to make all arrows point in the same direction by flipping columns, or "No" otherwise.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
