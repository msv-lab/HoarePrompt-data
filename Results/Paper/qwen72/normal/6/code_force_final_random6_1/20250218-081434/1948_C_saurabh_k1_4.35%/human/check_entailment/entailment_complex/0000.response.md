Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether a robot starting at cell (1, 1) can reach cell (2, n) by following a specific set of rules. The robot must move every second, and it must follow the direction of the arrow in the cell it ends up in after each move.

The given program checks if the character at the second-to-last position in the second row (`b[n - 2]`) is '<'. If it is, the program concludes that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n) and prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

However, this logic is incorrect because it only checks a single condition and does not fully account for the robot's movement rules. The robot can move in four directions (left, right, up, down) and must follow the arrow in the current cell. The program does not simulate the robot's movement through the grid, which is necessary to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
4
>><<
>>><
```
The program will print "No" because `b[2]` is '<'. However, the robot can actually reach (2, 4) by following the path:
1. (1, 1) -> (1, 2) (following the arrow in (1, 1))
2. (1, 2) -> (2, 2) (moving down)
3. (2, 2) -> (2, 3) (following the arrow in (2, 2))
4. (2, 3) -> (2, 4) (following the arrow in (2, 3))

This test case should return "Yes", but the program incorrectly returns "No".

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
