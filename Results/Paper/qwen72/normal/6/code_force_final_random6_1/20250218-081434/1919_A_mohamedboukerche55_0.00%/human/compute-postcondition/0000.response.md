The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is not explicitly set before the loop, but it will start at 0 by default in the `range` function. The function `func` and its parameters `a` and `b` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
