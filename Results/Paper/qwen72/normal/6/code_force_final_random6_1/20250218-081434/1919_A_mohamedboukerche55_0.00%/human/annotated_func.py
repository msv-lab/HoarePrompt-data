#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters `a` and `b` which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func(a, b):`.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: `i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `s` is the final input string, `a` is the integer value of the first word in the final input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the final input string `s`.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: bob
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: *`i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `s` is the final input string, `a` is the integer value of the first word in the final input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the final input string `s`. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the sum is divisible by 2. Otherwise, the sum of `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a series of input lines, where each line contains two integers `a` and `b`. After reading the specified number of lines, it checks the sum of the last pair of integers (`a` and `b`). If the sum is even, it prints "bob". If the sum is odd, it prints "alice". The function does not return any value.
