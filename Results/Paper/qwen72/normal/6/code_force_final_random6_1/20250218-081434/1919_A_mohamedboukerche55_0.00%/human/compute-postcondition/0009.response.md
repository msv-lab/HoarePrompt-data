Output State: **`i` is 2, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `s` is the new input string, `a` is the integer value of the first word in the new input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the new input string `s`**

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated to the new input string provided by the user. The values of `i`, `int(input())`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, but `a` and `b` will be recalculated based on the new input string `s`.
