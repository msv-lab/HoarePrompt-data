The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly in its function signature. It reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows` from standard input (stdin). `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of a grid, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the first and last elements of each list being 0.

The function returns a result based on the input values. However, the specific output is not provided in the constraints, so we can only describe the input parameters and the general structure of the function.

Functionality: **The function reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows` from standard input. `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of a grid, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the first and last elements of each list being 0. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given parameters.**
