To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`min_heap`**: This is a valid min-heap with the tuple `(row[i], i)` added to it. The exact contents of `min_heap` are not specified, but it must contain at least one element for `heappop` to work.
2. **`i`**: `i` is `d + 2`.
3. **`e`**: `e` is the result of `heappop(min_heap)`, which will be a tuple of the form `(value, index)`.
4. **Condition**: The loop will execute if `e[1]` (the index part of the tuple) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

### Initial State:
- `min_heap` is a valid min-heap with the tuple `(row[i], i)` added to it.
- `i` is `d + 2`.
- `row[i]` has been updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.
- `row` must have at least `d + 2` elements.

### Condition Analysis:
- The condition `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)` simplifies to `e[1] <= (d + 2) - (d + 2)`, which further simplifies to `e[1] <= 0`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the index `e[1]` must be less than or equal to 0. Since `min_heap` is a valid min-heap and contains the tuple `(row[i], i)`, the smallest index in `min_heap` must be `i` or less. However, `i` is `d + 2`, so the smallest index in `min_heap` must be less than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute.

### Adjustments:
- The only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `min_heap`.
- We need to ensure that the smallest index in `min_heap` is less than or equal to 0.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes at least once, `min_heap` must contain a tuple where the index part is less than or equal to 0.

State: **`min_heap` is a valid min-heap with at least one tuple `(value, index)` where `index <= 0`, `i` is `d + 2`, `row[i]` has been updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, `row` must have at least `d + 2` elements**
