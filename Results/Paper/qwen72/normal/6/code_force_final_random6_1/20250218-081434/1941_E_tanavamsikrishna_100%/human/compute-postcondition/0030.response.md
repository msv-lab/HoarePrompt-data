Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and `min_heap` is a valid min-heap with the tuple `e` added to it. The variable `i` is still `d + 1`, and `row[i]` has been updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1` again.**

Explanation: The tuple `e` is pushed into the `min_heap`, which remains a valid min-heap. The variable `i` and the value of `row[i]` remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
