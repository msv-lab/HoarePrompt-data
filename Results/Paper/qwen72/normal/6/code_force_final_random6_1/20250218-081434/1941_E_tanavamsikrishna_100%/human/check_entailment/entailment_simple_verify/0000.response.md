### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, the program code, and the annotated version.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- **Input**: `row` is a list of integers representing the depths of a row in the river grid, and `d` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le d < \text{len(row)}\).
- **Output**: The function returns the minimum cost of installing supports in the row, ensuring that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than \(d\).

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `row[0] = 1`: This sets the cost of the first support to 1 (since \(a_{i,1} = 0\) and the cost is \(a_{i,1} + 1\)).
   - `for i in range(1, d): row[i] = row[i] + 2`: This increases the cost of the first \(d\) cells by 2. This is because the cost of installing a support in any cell is \(a_{i,j} + 1\), and the initial cost of the cell is \(a_{i,j}\).

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - `min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]`: This creates a min-heap with the first \(d\) elements of the row, along with their indices.
   - `heapify(min_heap)`: This converts the list into a valid min-heap.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - `for i in range(d, len(row))`: This loop iterates over the remaining cells in the row.
   - `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`: This ensures that the heap only contains elements within the valid distance \(d\). Elements that are too far away (i.e., their index is less than \(i - (d + 2)\)) are removed from the heap.
   - `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1`: This updates the cost of the current cell to the minimum cost of the valid elements in the heap plus the cost of the current cell plus 1.
   - `heappush(min_heap, e)`: This re-pushes the element back into the heap.
   - `heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))`: This pushes the updated cost of the current cell into the heap.

4. **Return**:
   - `return row[-1]`: The function returns the last element of the row, which represents the minimum cost of installing supports in the row.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- **Input**: The function reads input values for \(n\), \(m\), \(k\), and \(d\) from stdin. It also reads \(n\) rows of the river grid.
- **Output**: The function prints the minimum total cost of installing supports for \(k\) consecutive rows.

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - `n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))`: Reads the number of rows, columns, bridges, and maximum distance.
   - `rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]`: Reads the river grid.

2. **Calculating Costs**:
   - `costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]`: This calculates the cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`.

3. **Finding Minimum Total Cost**:
   - `total_costs = []`: Initializes an empty list to store the total costs of \(k\) consecutive rows.
   - `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1))`: Iterates over all possible starting indices for \(k\) consecutive rows.
   - `total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))`: Appends the sum of the costs of \(k\) consecutive rows to the `total_costs` list.
   - `print(min(total_costs))`: Prints the minimum total cost.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:

The original assessment states that the program does not correctly handle the condition that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than \(d\). Specifically, it claims that `func_1` does not enforce the requirement that the distance between supports is \(|j_1 - j_2| - 1 \leq d\).

However, upon closer inspection:
- The heap `min_heap` is used to keep track of the minimum costs within a sliding window of size \(d\).
- The loop `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` ensures that only elements within the valid distance \(d\) are considered.
- The cost update `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` ensures that the cost of the current cell is added to the minimum cost within the valid distance, plus 1 for the support cost.

This logic correctly enforces the distance constraint \(|j_1 - j_2| - 1 \leq d\). The heap ensures that the minimum cost within the valid distance is always considered, and the cost update ensures that the distance constraint is respected.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly handles the distance constraint and calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for \(k\) consecutive rows. The original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **True**
