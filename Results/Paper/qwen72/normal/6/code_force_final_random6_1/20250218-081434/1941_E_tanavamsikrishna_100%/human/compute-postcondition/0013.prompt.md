You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed in the function signature. The function reads input values for n, m, k, d, and rows from stdin. n and m are positive integers, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and d is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m. rows is a list of n lists, each containing m integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the first and last elements of each list being 0.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= k`, `i` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers, `costs` is a list of `n` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`, `total_costs` is a list containing `len(costs) - (k - 1)` elements, where each element is the sum of a contiguous subsequence of `k` elements from `costs`.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: - The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum sum of any contiguous subsequence of `k` elements from the `costs` list.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `rows`, `d`, and `func_1` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `min(total_costs)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the minimum sum of any contiguous subsequence of `k` elements from the `costs` list.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows` from standard input. `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of a grid, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the first and last elements of each list being 0. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
