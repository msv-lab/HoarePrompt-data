To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head condition:

```python
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `min_heap`: This is the heap from which the element `e` is popped.
   - `i`: This is the index variable.
   - `d`: This is a positive integer such that 1 <= d < len(row).

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the index of the element popped from `min_heap` (i.e., `e[1]`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

3. **Current State:**
   - `row` is a list of integers.
   - `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d < len(row).
   - `i` is `d`.
   - `min_heap` is a valid min-heap containing tuples from the first `d` elements of `row`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` must be true.
   - Given that `i` is `d`, the condition simplifies to `e[1] <= d - (d + 2)`, which further simplifies to `e[1] <= -2`.

5. **Feasibility:**
   - Since `e[1]` represents an index from the first `d` elements of `row`, and `d` is a positive integer, `e[1]` will always be a non-negative integer (0, 1, ..., d-1).
   - Therefore, `e[1] <= -2` is impossible because `e[1]` cannot be less than or equal to -2.

### Conclusion:
- The loop cannot execute one more time with the given state because the condition `e[1] <= -2` is always false.
- Since the loop condition cannot be satisfied, no adjustments to the state are possible to make the loop execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`row` is a list of integers representing the depths of a row in the river grid, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d < len(row), `i` is `d`, `min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from the first `d` elements of `row` and its corresponding index, and `min_heap` is now a valid min-heap.**
