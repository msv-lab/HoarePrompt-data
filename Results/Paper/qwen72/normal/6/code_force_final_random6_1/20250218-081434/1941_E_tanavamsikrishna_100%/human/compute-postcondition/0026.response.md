To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `e`: This is the result of the `heappop(min_heap)` operation, which returns a tuple `(value, index)`.
   - `min_heap`: This is the min-heap from which the tuple is popped.
   - `i`: This is the current index.
   - `d`: This is a constant or variable that is part of the condition.

2. **Current State**:
   - `min_heap` is a valid min-heap with at least one tuple `(value, index)` where `index <= -1`.
   - `i` is `d + 1`.
   - `row` is a list of elements, and `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.

3. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop will execute if the index of the tuple popped from `min_heap` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.
   - Given `i` is `d + 1`, the condition simplifies to:
     \[
     (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= (d + 1) - (d + 2)
     \]
     \[
     (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= -1
     \]

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= -1` must be satisfied for the loop to execute again.
   - Since `min_heap` already contains at least one tuple `(value, index)` where `index <= -1`, the condition is already satisfied.
   - Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `min_heap` or `i`.

### Conclusion:
The loop condition is already satisfied with the current state, so the state does not need to be modified.

State: **`min_heap` is a valid min-heap with at least one tuple `(value, index)` where `index <= -1`, `i` is `d + 1`, `row` is a list of elements, and `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`**
