Output State: **`min_heap` is a valid min-heap with the element `e` added and the new element `(row[i], i)` added, `i` is `d + 2`, `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, and there are no tuples `(value, index)` in `min_heap` where `index <= 0`.** 

Explanation:
- The element `(row[i], i)` is pushed into `min_heap`.
- `min_heap` remains a valid min-heap after the push operation.
- The value of `i` is still `d + 2`.
- The value of `row[i]` is still `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.
- The condition that there are no tuples `(value, index)` in `min_heap` where `index <= 0` is still valid.
