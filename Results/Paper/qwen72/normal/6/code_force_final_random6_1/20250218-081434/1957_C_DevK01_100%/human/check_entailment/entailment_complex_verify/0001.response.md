### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. You place a white rook at \((r, c)\), and the computer places a black rook at \((c, r)\) unless \( r = c \), in which case the computer skips its turn.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \).
   - It then reads the \( k \) moves you have already made.

3. **State Update:**
   - For each move \((a, b)\), the program checks if \( a \neq b \).
   - If \( a \neq b \), it reduces \( n \) by 2 because both \((a, b)\) and \((b, a)\) are occupied.
   - If \( a = b \), it reduces \( n \) by 1 because only \((a, a)\) is occupied.
   - This state update is correct and aligns with the problem description.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Final Configurations:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to calculate the number of different final configurations.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp = [1, 1]` to handle the base cases:
     - `dp[0]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on a 0x0 board, which is 1 (the empty board).
     - `dp[1]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on a 1x1 board, which is 1 (one rook in the only cell).
   - The recurrence relation \( dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2] \) is correct:
     - `dp[i-1]` accounts for placing a rook in the current row and column without any additional rooks.
     - `2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]` accounts for placing a rook in the current row and column, and the two possible ways to place the rook in the previous row and column.
   - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case.
   - This output is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Validation of Annotated Code:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `n` is an integer representing the size of the \( n \times n \) chessboard, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5 \).
  - This is accurate and matches the problem constraints.

- **Function `func_1(n)`:**
  - The function correctly initializes the DP array with base cases.
  - The loop iterates from 2 to \( n \), updating the DP array based on the recurrence relation.
  - The modulo operation ensures that the result remains within the required range.
  - The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `n` remains unchanged, `i` is \( n + 1 \), and `dp` is a list with two elements: the last two values of the sequence generated by the loop.
  - The function returns the last value of the sequence, which is stored in the last element of the list `dp`.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly processes the input and updates the state based on the given moves.
- The dynamic programming approach in `func_1(n)` is correct for calculating the number of different final configurations.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the required range.
