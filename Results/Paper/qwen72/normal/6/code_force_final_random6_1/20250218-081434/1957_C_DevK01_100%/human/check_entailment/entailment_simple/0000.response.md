### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and updates the size of the chessboard `n` based on whether the move is mirrored or not.

2. **Updating the Chessboard Size:**
   - If the move `(a, b)` is such that `a != b`, the computer will place a rook at `(b, a)`, which means two rows and two columns are blocked. Therefore, `n` is decremented by 2.
   - If `a == b`, the move is on the diagonal, and the computer skips its turn. Therefore, `n` is decremented by 1.

3. **Dynamic Programming for Final Configurations:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to compute the number of possible final configurations.
   - The dynamic programming approach is used to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining board.
   - The `dp` list is initialized with `[1, 1]`, which represents the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1`.
   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, the program calculates the number of ways to place rooks using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the current row, considering the previous row and the row before that.

4. **State of the Program:**
   - Before the function call, `n` is correctly updated to reflect the remaining board size after the initial moves.
   - The function `func_1(n)` correctly computes the number of possible final configurations using the dynamic programming approach.
   - The final value of `dp` is returned, which is the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining board.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is reduced to 0 or 1 correctly.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard given the problem constraints and the initial moves. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for this problem, and the state of the program is correctly managed throughout the execution.

### Correctness:
**True**
