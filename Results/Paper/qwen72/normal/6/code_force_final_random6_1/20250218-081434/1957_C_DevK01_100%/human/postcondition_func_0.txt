The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the size of an n x n chessboard. It returns the last value of a sequence generated by a loop, which is stored in the last element of the list `dp`. The sequence is computed using a dynamic programming approach, and the final state of the program after the function concludes is that `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n + 1`, and `dp` is a list with two elements: the last two values of the sequence generated by the loop.
