Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `path` contains all vertices from 1 to n (inclusive) in some order, and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop, as it is not modified within the loop body.
- The `path` list will contain all the vertices from 1 to `n` (inclusive) in some order, as the loop continues to add vertices to `path` until there are no vertices left in `remaining_vertices`.
- The `remaining_vertices` set will be empty, as each vertex that is added to `path` is removed from `remaining_vertices`. The loop terminates when `remaining_vertices` is empty, meaning all vertices have been processed and added to `path`.
