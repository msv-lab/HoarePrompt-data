Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` contains the vertex `v` if `v` was not 0 and was added, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any) and `v` (if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`), `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` after the if statement, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the program proceeds without any changes to `path` or `remaining_vertices`.***
