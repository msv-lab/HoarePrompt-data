The only objects in the loop head are the variables `d` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over `d` starting from `n - 1` and decreases by 1 until `d` is -1. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is `n - 1`, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be decreased by 1 to `n - 2`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 2`, `path` contains at most one vertex (if a suitable `v` was found and added), `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any). If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is added to `path`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the current iteration.**
