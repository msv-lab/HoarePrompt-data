Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the current loop iteration is skipped. Otherwise, `v` and `u` retain their values, `v` is appended to the list `path`, and `v` is removed from the list `remaining_vertices`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- The value of `d` remains `n - 1`.
- The values of `v` and `u` are still the values returned by `func_1(d)`.
- If `v` is 0, the loop iteration is skipped, and no changes occur to `path` or `remaining_vertices`.
- If `v` is not 0, `v` is appended to the list `path`, and `v` is removed from the list `remaining_vertices`. The other variables remain unchanged.
