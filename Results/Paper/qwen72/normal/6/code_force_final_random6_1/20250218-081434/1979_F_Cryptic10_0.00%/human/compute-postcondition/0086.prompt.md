Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, representing the number of vertices in the graph; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive).
Code of the loop:
while remaining_vertices:
    for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        v, u = func_1(d)
        if v == 0:
            continue
        if v in remaining_vertices:
            path.append(v)
            remaining_vertices.remove(v)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is 0, `path` contains at most one vertex (if a suitable `v` was found and added), and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is -1, `path` contains at most one vertex (if a suitable `v` was found and added), `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any). If a suitable `v` was found and added to `path` during any iteration, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`. If no suitable `v` was found, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is -1, `path` contains at most one vertex (if a suitable `v` was found and added), `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any).


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
