Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `path` contains all vertices from 1 to `n` (inclusive) in some order.
- `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f"! {' '.join(map(str, path))}")
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`path`**: This is a list that contains all integers from 1 to `n` in some order. For example, if `n` is 5, `path` could be `[1, 3, 2, 5, 4]` or any other permutation of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

2. **`map(str, path)`**: This function applies the `str` function to each element in the `path` list, converting each integer to a string. For example, if `path` is `[1, 3, 2, 5, 4]`, `map(str, path)` will produce an iterator that yields `['1', '3', '2', '5', '4']`.

3. **`' '.join(map(str, path))`**: This function joins the elements of the iterator produced by `map(str, path)` into a single string, with each element separated by a space. For example, if `map(str, path)` yields `['1', '3', '2', '5', '4']`, then `' '.join(map(str, path))` will produce the string `"1 3 2 5 4"`.

4. **`f"! {' '.join(map(str, path))}"`**: This is a formatted string that starts with an exclamation mark `!` followed by the string produced by `' '.join(map(str, path))`. For example, if `path` is `[1, 3, 2, 5, 4]`, the formatted string will be `"! 1 3 2 5 4"`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print a string that starts with an exclamation mark `!` followed by the space-separated elements of the `path` list, which contains all integers from 1 to `n` in some order.

Output: **! 1 2 3 ... n (where 1 2 3 ... n is the space-separated list of all integers from 1 to n in the order they appear in the `path` list)**
