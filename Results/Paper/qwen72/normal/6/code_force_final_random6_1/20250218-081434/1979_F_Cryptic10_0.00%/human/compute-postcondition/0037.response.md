Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` contains the vertex `v` (if a suitable `v` was found and added), `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any) and must contain at least one element, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the current iteration. The current value of `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.**

Explanation:
- The code `path.append(v)` adds the value of `v` to the list `path`.
- The initial state mentions that `path` contains at most one vertex (if a suitable `v` was found and added). After the code execution, `path` now contains the vertex `v`.
- The value of `v` is still in `remaining_vertices`, as it is not removed from the set in this code snippet.
- The other variables (`n`, `d`, `remaining_vertices`, `u`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `v` is 0 and the program skips the rest of the current iteration is not applicable here, as `v` is added to `path`, indicating it is not 0.
