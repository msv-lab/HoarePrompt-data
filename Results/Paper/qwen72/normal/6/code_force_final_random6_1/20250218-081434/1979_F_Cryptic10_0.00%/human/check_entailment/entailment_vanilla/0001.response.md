### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices.
   - \( n - 2 \) edges are removed from this graph.
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in the original graph using at most \( n \) queries.
   - Each query returns a vertex \( v \) with a degree at least \( d \) and another vertex \( u \) that is not connected to \( v \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to make queries and receive responses.
   - The function `func_2` is the main function that constructs the Hamiltonian path.
   - The program maintains a set of remaining vertices and a list to store the path.
   - It iterates over possible degrees \( d \) from \( n-1 \) down to 0.
   - For each degree \( d \), it makes a query and receives a vertex \( v \) and another vertex \( u \).
   - If \( v \) is 0, it continues to the next degree.
   - If \( v \) is a valid vertex (i.e., it is in the set of remaining vertices), it adds \( v \) to the path and removes it from the set of remaining vertices.
   - The process continues until all vertices are added to the path.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm ensures that it always selects a vertex \( v \) with the minimum degree among the vertices with a degree at least \( d \).
   - It also ensures that the selected vertex \( v \) is not connected to another vertex \( u \) with the minimum number.
   - By removing \( v \) and its edges, the algorithm guarantees that the next query will consider the updated graph.
   - The algorithm uses at most \( n \) queries, as it will stop once all vertices are added to the path.
   - The Hamiltonian path is constructed by adding vertices one by one, ensuring that each vertex is connected to the next in the path.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( v \) is 0 by continuing to the next degree.
   - It also handles the case where the graph is reduced to a single vertex by ensuring that the set of remaining vertices is empty before the loop ends.

5. **Output and Interaction:**
   - The program correctly flushes the output buffer after each query and after reporting the path.
   - It follows the interaction rules as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by constructing a Hamiltonian path using at most \( n \) queries. It handles all edge cases and follows the interaction rules.

Correctness: **True**
