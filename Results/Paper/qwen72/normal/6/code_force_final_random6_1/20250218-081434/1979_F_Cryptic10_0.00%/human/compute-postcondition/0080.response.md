Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 3`, and `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the loop body and move to the next iteration, leaving `path` and `remaining_vertices` unchanged. If `v` is not 0 and `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices` and appended to `path`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` or if `v` is 0, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.***
