Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` contains the vertex `v` (if `v` was not 0 and was added), `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any) and must be non-empty, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`, `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.**
