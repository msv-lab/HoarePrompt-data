The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `num2`. `a` is a list of integers where the length of the list is between 2 and 100, and each integer in the list is between 1 and 10^9. `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and it is between 1 and 500. The function returns `True` in one case and `False` in another case, but the specific conditions for these cases are not provided in the constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers (2 <= len(a) <= 100, 1 <= a_i <= 10^9) and an integer `num2` (1 <= num2 <= 500). It returns `True` in one case and `False` in another case, based on some conditions that are not specified in the provided constraints.**
