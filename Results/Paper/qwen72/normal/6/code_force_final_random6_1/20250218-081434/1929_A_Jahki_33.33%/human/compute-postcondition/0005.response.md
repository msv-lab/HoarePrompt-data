To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it changes from one iteration to the next. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(1, num2):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variable `i` is the loop counter.
   - The variable `num2` is the upper bound of the loop (exclusive).

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `num2` is greater than 1.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will increment `i` by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `num2`.

4. **Update the State:**
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `num2` must still be greater than 2.

5. **Consider the List `a` and Variable `order`:**
   - The list `a` and the variable `order` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
- `a` remains a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
- `num2` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `order` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (1 if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `a[1]`, otherwise 0).

State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `num2` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `a[1]`, then `order` is 1. Otherwise, `order` remains 0.**
