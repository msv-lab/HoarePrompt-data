### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`num2`) and the array elements (`a`).

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It does this by counting the number of indices `i` where `a[i-1] >= a[i]`. If this count (`order`) is zero, the array is sorted, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Main Program Logic:**
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the program prints `0` because the beauty of a sorted array is zero (since all differences `a_i - a_{i-1}` are non-negative and the sum of non-negative differences is zero).
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the program sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty by summing the differences `b[x] - b[x-1]` for all `x` from 1 to `num2-1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the maximum beauty for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Function `func_1` Misuse:**
  - The function `func_1` is checking if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, but this is not necessary for the problem. The problem asks for the maximum beauty, which is achieved by sorting the array in non-decreasing order and then calculating the beauty.
  - The function `func_1` should not be used at all. Instead, the program should directly sort the array and calculate the beauty.

### Corrected Program:
```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    b = sorted(a)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is **incorrect** because it uses an unnecessary function `func_1` that checks if the array is already sorted, which is not required for the problem. The problem can be solved by directly sorting the array and calculating the beauty.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
