Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k == n`, a range from 0 to `n-1` if `k == 1`, or `[-1]` otherwise.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated based on the conditions provided in the code snippet.
  - If `k == n`, `res` becomes a list of `n` ones.
  - If `k == 1`, `res` becomes a range from 0 to `n-1`.
  - Otherwise, `res` becomes `[-1]`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
