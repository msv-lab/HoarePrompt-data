The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t` and the current value of `_`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than 0 to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k == n`, a range from 0 to `n-1` if `k == 1`, or `[-1]` otherwise.**
