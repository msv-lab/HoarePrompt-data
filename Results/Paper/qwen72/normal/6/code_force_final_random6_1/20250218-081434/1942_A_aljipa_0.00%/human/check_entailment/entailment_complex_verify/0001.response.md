Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` which represent the length of the array and the number of sorted cyclic shifts, respectively.

2. **Case Handling**:
   - **Case 1: `k == n`**:
     - If `k` is equal to `n`, the program constructs an array `res` with `n` elements, all set to 1.
     - This is correct because an array with all elements equal will have all its cyclic shifts sorted.
   - **Case 2: `k == 1`**:
     - If `k` is equal to 1, the program constructs an array `res` with elements from 0 to `n-1` using `range(n)`.
     - This is correct because an array with distinct elements in increasing order will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself.
   - **Case 3: `k != 1 and k != n`**:
     - If `k` is neither 1 nor `n`, the program outputs `-1`.
     - This is incorrect because it does not consider other possible values of `k` that might still allow for a valid array. For example, if `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 1]` for `n = 3`. The program fails to generate such arrays and incorrectly concludes that no valid array exists.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of the array `res` using the `print(*res)` syntax, which correctly unpacks the list and prints the elements separated by spaces.

Given the above reasoning, the program is indeed incorrect because it does not handle the case where `k` is neither 1 nor `n` properly. It should be able to generate a valid array for other values of `k` as well.

Final: **False**
