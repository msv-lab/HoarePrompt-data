The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the length of the array and `k` is the number of sorted cyclic shifts required. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. Additionally, the function handles multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.

The function returns the array after performing `k` sorted cyclic shifts on it. A sorted cyclic shift means that the array is shifted cyclically to the right, and after each shift, the array is sorted.
