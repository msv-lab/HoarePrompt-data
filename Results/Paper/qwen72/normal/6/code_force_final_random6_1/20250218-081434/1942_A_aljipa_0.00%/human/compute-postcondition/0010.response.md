Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k == n`, a range from 0 to `n-1` if `k == 1`, or `[-1]` otherwise.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the first and second input integers, respectively.
- The value of `t` remains greater than 0.
- The value of `_` remains 2.
- The value of `res` is determined based on the new values of `n` and `k` as follows:
  - If `k` is equal to `n`, `res` is a list of `n` ones.
  - If `k` is equal to 1, `res` is a range from 0 to `n-1`.
  - Otherwise, `res` is `[-1]`.
