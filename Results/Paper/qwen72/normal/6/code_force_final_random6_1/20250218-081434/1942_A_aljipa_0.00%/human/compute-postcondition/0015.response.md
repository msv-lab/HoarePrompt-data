Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the length of the array and `k` is the number of sorted cyclic shifts required. The function then prints a list `res` based on the following conditions: if `k == n`, it prints a list of `n` ones; if `k == 1`, it prints a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; otherwise, it prints `[-1]`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. **
