Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 48\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is explicitly set to 2.

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of the variable `i`.

Since `i` is explicitly set to 2, the output will be:

Output: **2**
