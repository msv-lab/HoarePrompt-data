Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is `n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` will have been decremented to 0. This is because the loop runs `t` times, and each time it runs, `t` is decreased by 1 until it reaches 0, at which point the loop condition `while t` becomes false and the loop terminates.

For each iteration of the loop, the variable `n` is set to a new integer value provided by the user, and the inner loop runs from 1 to `n` (inclusive). After the inner loop completes for each test case, `i` will be equal to `n`.

Since the loop runs `t` times, and `t` is initially an integer between 1 and 50, after all iterations, `t` will be 0, and `n` will be the last input integer provided by the user, which still satisfies the condition 2 <= n <= 10^3. The variable `i` will also be equal to this last `n` value.
