### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to choose \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \).
   - It then prints \( n \) points, all of which have the same \( x \)-coordinate (1) and different \( y \)-coordinates ranging from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Evaluating the Output:**
   - The points printed by the program are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), ..., \((1, n)\).
   - The Manhattan distance between any two points \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) is \( |1 - 1| + |i - j| = |i - j| \).
   - The set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) will be \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\).

4. **Maximizing the Set of Distances:**
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains \( n \) distinct distances: \( 0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1 \).
   - This is the maximum possible number of distinct distances for \( n \) points in an \( n \times n \) grid, as the maximum distance between any two points in the grid is \( n-1 \).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly outputs \( n \) points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.
   - The output format is also correct, as it prints each point on a new line with the coordinates separated by a space.

However, there is a minor issue in the program that needs to be addressed:
- The program prints an extra space at the end of the last line for each test case. This is due to the `print(' ')` statement after the loop. This extra space is not necessary and can be removed to ensure the output format is strictly correct.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', i)
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate in terms of the logic and correctness of the program's output.
- However, the program has a minor issue with an extra space at the end of the last line for each test case, which can be fixed by removing the `print(' ')` statement.

Final: **True**

The program is correct in its logic and output, but it can be improved by removing the unnecessary extra space. Despite this minor issue, the core functionality and correctness of the program remain valid.
