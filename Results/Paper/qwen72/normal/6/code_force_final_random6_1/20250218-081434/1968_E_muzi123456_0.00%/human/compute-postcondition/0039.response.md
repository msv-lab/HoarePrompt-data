The given print statement is:
```
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 47.
   - `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
   - `i` is 3.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` function is called with the string `'1'` as the first argument.
   - The `end` parameter is set to `' '`, which means that after printing the string `'1'`, the print function will not move to a new line but will instead add a space.

3. **Output**:
   - The string `'1'` will be printed.
   - Since the `end` parameter is set to `' '`, a space will follow the string `'1'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 **

This means that the number `1` will be printed followed by a space.
