The `print` statement in the provided code snippet will print the string `'1'` and will not move the cursor to the next line because the `end=' '` parameter is used, which specifies that a space should be used as the end character instead of a newline.

The variables and objects mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, and `i`) are not used in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Output: **1 (followed by a space)**
