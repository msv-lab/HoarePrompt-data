Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The program prints the coordinates of cells in a way that all cells are in the first row, which does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. For example, for \(n = 3\), the program outputs:

```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```

This results in the set \(\mathcal{H}\) being \(\{1, 2\}\) (since the only possible distances are between the cells in the first row), which is not the maximum possible size. The correct solution should aim to place the cells in such a way that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances is maximized. For \(n = 3\), a correct output could be:

```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```

This arrangement results in the set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\). Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.
