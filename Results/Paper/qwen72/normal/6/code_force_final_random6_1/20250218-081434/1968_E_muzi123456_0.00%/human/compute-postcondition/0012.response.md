The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the value of the variable `i`.

Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 49.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3.
- `i` is explicitly set to 3.

Since the value of `i` is explicitly defined as 3, the `print` statement will output this value.

Output: **3**
