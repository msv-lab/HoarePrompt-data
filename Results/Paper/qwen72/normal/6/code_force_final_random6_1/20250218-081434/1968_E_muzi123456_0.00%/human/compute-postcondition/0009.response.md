Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 49.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
- `i` is explicitly set to 2.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly set to 2, the `print` statement will output the value of `i`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
