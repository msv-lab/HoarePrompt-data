### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to choose \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \).
   - It then prints \( n \) points, all of which have the same \( x \)-coordinate (1) and different \( y \)-coordinates ranging from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Evaluating the Output:**
   - The points printed by the program are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), ..., \((1, n)\).
   - The Manhattan distance between any two points \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) is \( |1 - 1| + |i - j| = |i - j| \).
   - The set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) will be \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\).

4. **Maximizing the Set of Distances:**
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains \( n \) distinct distances: \( 0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1 \).
   - This is the maximum possible number of distinct distances for \( n \) points in an \( n \times n \) grid, as the maximum distance between any two points in the grid is \( n-1 \).

5. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints each point on a new line with the coordinates separated by a space, which is the correct format as specified in the problem description.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The initial state of the program is that \( t \) is an integer such that \( 1 \le t \le 50 \), and for each of the \( t \) test cases, \( n \) is an integer such that \( 2 \le n \le 10^3 \).
   - The program correctly reads \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and prints \( n \) points with \( x \)-coordinate 1 and \( y \)-coordinates ranging from 1 to \( n \).
   - The final state of the program is that \( t \) is 0, and the program has processed all test cases.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly outputs \( n \) points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for the given \( n \times n \) grid.
- The output format is also correct, as it prints each point on a new line with the coordinates separated by a space.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
