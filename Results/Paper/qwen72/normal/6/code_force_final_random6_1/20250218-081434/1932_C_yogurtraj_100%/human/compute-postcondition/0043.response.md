Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed by the `print(*y)` statement.

### Initial State:
1. `ii` is 0.
2. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
3. `m` is an integer greater than 0.
4. `a` is a list of integers.
5. `t` is a string.
6. `l` is the number of times 'L' appears in `t`.
7. `y` is a list of `n` integers where the last element is `k`.
8. `k` is defined as:
   - `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L'.
   - `a[l] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L'.
9. `q1` is defined as:
   - `l - 2 - (n - 1)` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and the number of 'R' characters in `t` is less than `n - 1`.
   - `l - 1 - (n - 1)` otherwise.
10. `q2` is defined as:
    - `l + (n - 1)` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and the number of 'R' characters in `t` is less than `n - 1`.
    - `l + 1 + (n - 1)` otherwise.
11. `i` is -1.
12. `y` is fully populated with the values of `k` after each iteration of the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(*y)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `l`**:
   - `l` is the number of times 'L' appears in the string `t`.

2. **Determine `k`**:
   - If the last character of `t` is 'L', then `k = a[l - 1] % m`.
   - If the last character of `t` is not 'L', then `k = a[l] % m`.

3. **Determine the values of `q1` and `q2`**:
   - These values are not directly used in the `print(*y)` statement, so we can ignore them for the purpose of this task.

4. **Populate `y`**:
   - `y` is a list of `n` integers.
   - Each element of `y` is `k`.
   - Since `y` is fully populated with the values of `k`, the list `y` will contain `n` elements, all of which are `k`.

5. **Print `y`**:
   - The `print(*y)` statement will print all elements of `y` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
- The list `y` contains `n` elements, all of which are `k`.
- `k` is either `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `a[l] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L'.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **k k k ... k (n times)**

Where `k` is:
- `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L'.
- `a[l] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L'.
