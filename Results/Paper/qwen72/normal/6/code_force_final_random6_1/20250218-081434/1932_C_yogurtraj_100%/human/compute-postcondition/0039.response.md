The code snippet `q1 -= 1` decrements the value of `q1` by 1. The initial state specifies that `q1` is either `l - 2` or `l - 4` depending on whether `t[i]` is 'R' or not. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change in `q1`.

Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of times 'L' appears in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where the last element is `k` (which is `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `a[l] % m`), `i` is `n - 4`, `y[n - 2]` is `k`, `y[i]` is `k`, and `q1` is `l - 3` if `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `q1` is `l - 5`. `q2` is `l + 3` if `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `q2` is `l + 2`. `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`.**
