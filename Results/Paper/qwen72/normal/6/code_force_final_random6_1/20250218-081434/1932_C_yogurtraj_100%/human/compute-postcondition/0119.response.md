The loop head in the given for loop is `for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1)`. The objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 2` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 each time.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `n - 3`
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, and the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `n - 4`
- `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to be valid, but for the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `n - 4` must be greater than or equal to 0, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
