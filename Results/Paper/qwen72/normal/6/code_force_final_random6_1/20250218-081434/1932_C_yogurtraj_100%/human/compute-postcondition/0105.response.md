Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, the element at index `i` in the list `t` is 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `k = k * a[q2] % m` updates the value of `k` to the result of the expression `k * a[q2] % m`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the element at index `i` in the list `t` remain unchanged. The new value of `k` depends on the current values of `k`, `a[q2]`, and `m`.
