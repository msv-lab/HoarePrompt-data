To determine what will be printed by the `print(*y)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is -1.
- `k` is the final value of `k` after all iterations.
- `q1` and `q2` are updated based on the loop conditions.
- `y` is a list where each element from index 0 to `n-2` is the corresponding value of `k` after each iteration.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(*y)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `y`**:
   - The list `y` is described as containing the value of `k` after each iteration of some loop.
   - The length of `y` is `n-1` (since it contains elements from index 0 to `n-2`).

2. **Understanding `k`**:
   - `k` is updated in each iteration of the loop.
   - The final value of `k` is the value that `k` has after the last iteration.

3. **Understanding `q1` and `q2`**:
   - These variables are updated based on the loop conditions, but their exact values are not provided in the initial state.

4. **Output of `print(*y)`**:
   - The `print(*y)` statement will unpack the list `y` and print its elements separated by spaces.
   - Each element in `y` is the value of `k` after each iteration of the loop.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `k` after each iteration are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the values that `k` takes during the loop. The output will be a sequence of these values separated by spaces.

Output: **k_0 k_1 k_2 ... k_(n-2) (where k_i is the value of k after the i-th iteration of the loop)**
