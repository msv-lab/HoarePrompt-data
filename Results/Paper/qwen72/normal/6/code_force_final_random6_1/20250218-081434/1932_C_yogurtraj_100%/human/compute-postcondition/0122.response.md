Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to the result of `k * a[q1] % m`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The initial state conditions that `i` is `n - 4` and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 are still valid.
