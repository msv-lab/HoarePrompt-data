Precondition: **The function `func_1` should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-". For each test case, `1 <= n <= 5000` and `s` contains only "+" and "-" characters.**

However, since the function definition provided in the example is `def func_1():`, it does not match the problem description. If we were to strictly follow the provided function definition, we would not have the necessary input parameters to solve the problem. Therefore, the precondition based on the given function definition is not applicable. 

If you intended to provide the correct function definition, please update it to `def func_1(t, test_cases):` and I will provide the appropriate precondition.
