The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-". For each test case, `1 <= n <= 5000` and `s` contains only "+" and "-" characters. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and indicates some computation based on the string `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-". The function returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case and based on the string `s`.**
