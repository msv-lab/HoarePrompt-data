You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-". For each test case, `1 <= n <= 5000` and `s` contains only "+" and "-" characters.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
        
    #State: `func_1` is defined with parameters `t` and `test_cases`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
    #This is printed: n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where n is the input integer and neg is the number of '-' characters in the input string s)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from user input. The string `s` consists of characters "+" and "-". The function calculates the number of "-" characters in `s` and prints the result of `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a while loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Counting Negatives:**
   - The program counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores this count in the variable `neg`.

3. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The penalty calculation is based on the formula `print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)`.
   - This formula is derived from the observation that the optimal way to minimize the penalty is to split the array such that the sum of each subarray is zero whenever possible.
   - If the number of '+' and '-' characters is not equal (i.e., `n != neg`), the penalty is calculated as `n - 2 * neg`. This is because each '-' character contributes -1 to the sum, and each '+' character contributes 1. The optimal split would balance the number of '+' and '-' characters as much as possible.
   - If the number of '+' and '-' characters is equal (i.e., `n == neg`), the penalty is simply `n` because the sum of the entire array is zero, and the penalty is the length of the array.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the string `s` is entirely composed of '+' or '-' characters correctly.
   - For a string with equal numbers of '+' and '-' characters, the penalty is zero, which is correctly handled by the formula.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum possible penalty based on the given problem description. It handles all the edge cases and follows the correct approach to minimize the penalty.

### Correctness:
**True**
