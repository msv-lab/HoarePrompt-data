### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not handle the problem as described. Let's break down the issues and validate the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters:**
   - The annotated code suggests that `func_1` should be defined with parameters to match the problem description. However, the provided program defines `func_1` without any parameters, which is a deviation from the problem's requirements. This is not the primary issue affecting correctness, but it is a valid point.

2. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the penalty based on the number of '-' characters and the length of the string. Specifically, it computes `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.
   - This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the penalty. The penalty is defined as the sum of the penalties of the subarrays, where the penalty of each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     4
     ++--
     ```
     - The optimal way to split this string would be `([1, 1], [-1, -1])`, which results in a penalty of:
       \[
       p([1, 1]) + p([-1, -1]) = |1 + 1| \cdot 2 + |-1 + -1| \cdot 2 = 2 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 2 = 4 + 4 = 8
       \]
     - However, the program calculates the penalty as:
       \[
       n - 2 \cdot \text{neg} = 4 - 2 \cdot 2 = 4 - 4 = 0
       \]
     - This is clearly incorrect.

4. **General Case Analysis:**
   - The program's logic assumes that the penalty can be minimized by simply subtracting twice the number of '-' characters from the length of the string. This is a flawed assumption because it does not account for the optimal subarray splits.
   - The correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal splits that minimize the total penalty.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described and fails to implement the logic for splitting the array and calculating the penalty optimally. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
