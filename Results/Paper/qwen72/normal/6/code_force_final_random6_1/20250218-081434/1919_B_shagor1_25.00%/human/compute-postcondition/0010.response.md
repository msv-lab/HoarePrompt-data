The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute again for the third character. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 2 characters, and `i` is the second character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 3 characters, and `i` will be the third character of `s`.

State: **`func_1` is defined with parameters `t` and `test_cases`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least three characters, `i` is the third character of `s`. If `i` is equal to '-', `neg` is set to 2. Otherwise, `neg` remains 0.**
