Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list `a` of length `n` containing integers (0 or 1) where 0 represents a free cell and 1 represents a cell with a chip. The input is provided in a structured format where the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), followed by `t` test cases, each with two lines as described. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = 0
    while a and a[0] == 0:
        a.pop(0)
    while a and a[-1] == 0:
        a.pop()
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == 0:
            res += 1
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`. `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a non-empty list, `i` is `len(a) - 1`. `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`, `t` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed, `n` is an input integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
