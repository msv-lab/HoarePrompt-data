Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If the first element of `a` is 0, `res` is 1. If `a[i]` (the second element of `a`) is 0, `res` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.***
