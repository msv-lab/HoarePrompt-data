Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is 0, `res` is 1, and the first element of `a` is 0.**

The value of `res` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
