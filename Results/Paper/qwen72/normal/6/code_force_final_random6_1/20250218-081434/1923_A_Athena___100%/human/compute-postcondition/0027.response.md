Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `res` is 1 or 2 or 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is incremented by 1.
- If the first element of `a` was 0, `res` was initially 1, so now `res` is 2.
- If `a[1]` or `a[2]` was 0, `res` was initially 1 or 2, so now `res` is 2 or 3.
- Otherwise, if `res` was initially 0, `res` is now 1.
- The states of the other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged.
