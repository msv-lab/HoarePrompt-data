Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `res` is 1 or 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Initially, `res` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the first element of `a` is 0 or not. After the increment, `res` will be 1 if it was initially 0, or 2 if it was initially 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
