The variables in the loop head are `a` and the condition `a[-1] == 0`. The loop can execute again if `a` is non-empty and its last element is 0. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and its last element is removed. For the loop to execute one more time, the last element of `a` must be 0 again.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and its last element is 0, `res` is 0**
