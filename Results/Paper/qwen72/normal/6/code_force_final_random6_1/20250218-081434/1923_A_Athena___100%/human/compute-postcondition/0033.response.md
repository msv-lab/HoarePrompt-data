The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. This operation overwrites the previous value of `a`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`**
