The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that `a` is a non-empty list and its first element is no longer 0, and `a[-1]` is no longer 0, after the code is executed, `a` will still be a non-empty list, but it will have one fewer element. The value of `a[-1]` will now be the second-to-last element of the original list, and the length of `a` will be reduced by 1. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, `res`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list and its first element is no longer 0, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `res` is 0, and `a[-1]` is the second-to-last element of the original list.**
