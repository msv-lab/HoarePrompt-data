The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of length `n` containing integers (0 or 1). For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of free cells (0s) that are not at the beginning or end of the list after removing any leading and trailing free cells. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, `n` and `a` holding the values from the last test case, and `res` being the number of free cells in the last processed list `a` after the specified removal.
