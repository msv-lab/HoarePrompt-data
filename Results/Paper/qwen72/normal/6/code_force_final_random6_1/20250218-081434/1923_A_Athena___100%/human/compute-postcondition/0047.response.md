The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` is 0, this element is removed, and the length of `a` is reduced by 1. The value of `i` is `len(a) - 2`, so after the last element is removed, `i` will be `len(a) - 1`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `res`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list and its last element is removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `res` is 0**
