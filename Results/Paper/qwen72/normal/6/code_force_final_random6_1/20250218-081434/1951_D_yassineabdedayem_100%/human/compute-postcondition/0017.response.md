The only objects in the loop head are the variables `t` and `_`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `_` is a placeholder variable that has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `t`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is a placeholder variable incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the standard input, where `n` and `k` are the first and second integers in the input line, respectively. If `n` is equal to `k`, the current values of `n` and `k` remain equal. If `n` is not equal to `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` or `n + 2 <= k * 2` holds, depending on the values of `n` and `k`.**
