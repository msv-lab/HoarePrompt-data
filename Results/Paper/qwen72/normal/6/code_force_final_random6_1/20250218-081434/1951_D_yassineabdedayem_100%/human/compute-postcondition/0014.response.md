Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
2. `_` is a placeholder variable, which is often used in Python to indicate that the value is not needed or will not be used.
3. `n` and `k` are integers read from the standard input, where `n` and `k` are the first and second integers in the input line, respectively.
4. `n` is not equal to `k`.
5. `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

Given these conditions, the code snippet is:
```
print('NO')
```

The `print` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the content of the `print` statement, as it is a static string and does not depend on any variables or conditions.

Output: **NO**
