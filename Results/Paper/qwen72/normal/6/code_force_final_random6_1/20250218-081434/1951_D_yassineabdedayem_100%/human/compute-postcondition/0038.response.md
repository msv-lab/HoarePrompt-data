Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is a placeholder variable that is incremented by 1.
- `n` and `k` are the first and second integers in the input line, respectively.
- If `n` is equal to `k`, the current values of `n` and `k` remain equal.
- If `n` is not equal to `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` or `n + 2 <= k * 2` holds, depending on the values of `n` and `k`.

The given Python code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This code snippet simply prints the string `'NO'`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement, as the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Output: **NO**
