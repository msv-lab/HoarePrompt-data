### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

2. **Conditions for Setting Up Stalls**:
   - **Case 1**: If `n` is equal to `k`, then Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel. This is always possible, and the program correctly prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls (1) and the price (1).
   - **Case 2**: If `n + 2 > k * 2`, the program prints "YES" and sets up two stalls. The first stall is priced at `n - k + 1` coins per jewel, and the second stall is priced at 1 coin per jewel. This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels:
     - Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall, spending `(k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins.
     - She will then have `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins left, which is exactly `k` coins.
     - Alice will buy 1 jewel from the second stall, spending 1 coin, and will be left with `k - 1` coins.
     - This ensures she buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - **Case 3**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "NO". This is because if `n + 2 <= k * 2`, it implies that `n` is too small to buy `k` jewels even if Bob sets up the stalls optimally.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program correctly prints "YES" or "NO" for each test case.
   - If the answer is "YES", it prints the number of stalls and the prices for each stall, which are valid according to the problem constraints.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles all the given conditions and ensures that the output is valid for each test case.
- The logic for setting up the stalls and prices is sound and meets the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
