Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `_` is a placeholder variable.
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the standard input.
   - `n` and `k` are the first and second integers in the input line, respectively.
   - `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - The current value of `n` plus 2 is greater than the current value of `k` times 2. This can be written as: \( n + 2 > 2k \).

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(n - k + 1, end=' ')` will print the value of the expression `n - k + 1` and will not move to a new line after printing (due to `end=' '`).

3. **Expression Analysis:**
   - We need to determine the value of `n - k + 1`.
   - From the condition \( n + 2 > 2k \), we can rearrange it to get \( n > 2k - 2 \).
   - Therefore, \( n - k + 1 > (2k - 2) - k + 1 \).
   - Simplifying the right-hand side: \( (2k - 2) - k + 1 = k - 1 \).
   - So, \( n - k + 1 > k - 1 \).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The value of `n - k + 1` will be greater than `k - 1`.
   - Since `n` and `k` are integers and `n` is not equal to `k`, the value of `n - k + 1` will be a positive integer.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the print statement will output the value of `n - k + 1`, which is a positive integer greater than `k - 1`.

Output: **n - k + 1 (where n - k + 1 is a positive integer greater than k - 1)**
