Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem by using a priority queue (min-heap) to always purchase tickets on the cheapest available day, taking into account the price increase due to previous purchases. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of days `n`, the maximum number of tickets `m` that can be bought per day, and the total number of tickets `k` to be bought. It also reads the list of ticket prices for each day.

2. **Priority Queue Initialization**: The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with the initial prices and their corresponding days. This allows the program to efficiently find the day with the lowest price.

3. **Total Cost Calculation**:
   - The program maintains a `total_cost` variable to keep track of the total spending.
   - It also maintains `tickets_bought` to count the number of tickets already purchased and `price_increase` to account for the price increase due to previous purchases.
   - The program enters a loop that continues until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
   - In each iteration, it pops the smallest price from the priority queue, adjusts the price by adding the `price_increase`, and calculates the number of tickets to buy (`tickets_to_buy`), which is the minimum of `m` and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - It then updates the `total_cost` by adding the cost of the tickets bought on that day.
   - The `tickets_bought` and `price_increase` are updated accordingly.

4. **Output**: The program prints the `total_cost` for each test case, which is the minimum amount of money needed to purchase exactly `k` tickets.

The logic and implementation are sound and correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
