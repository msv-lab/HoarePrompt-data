Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from `prices` and its corresponding index.**

Explanation:
- The code creates a new list `pq` using a list comprehension.
- Each element in `pq` is a tuple `(price, i)`, where `price` is the value from the `prices` list at index `i`, and `i` is the index itself.
- The list `pq` will have the same length as `prices`, and each tuple in `pq` will contain the price and its index.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The values of `prices` remain unchanged.
- The new list `pq` is created and populated with the tuples as described.
