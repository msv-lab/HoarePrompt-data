You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)
    print(result)

def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    import heapq
    pq = [(price, i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
    return total_cost



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (number of ticket types), `m` (number of tickets available per type), `k` (number of tickets to buy), and `prices` (a list of prices for each ticket type). It calculates and returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, where the price of each ticket increases by the number of tickets bought so far. After the function concludes, `k` tickets have been bought, and the total cost reflects the cumulative price increase. The function does not modify the input parameters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `prices`.

2. **Priority Queue (Min-Heap)**:
   - The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) `pq` with tuples of the form `(price, day)`, where `price` is the ticket price on a given day and `day` is the index of that day.
   - This allows the program to always consider the day with the lowest current price first.

3. **Heapify**:
   - The `heapq.heapify(pq)` function is used to convert the list `pq` into a heap, which is efficient for repeatedly extracting the minimum element.

4. **Main Loop**:
   - The program enters a loop that continues until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
   - In each iteration, it extracts the day with the lowest current price from the heap.
   - It then calculates the actual price for that day by adding the cumulative price increase `price_increase` to the extracted price.
   - The number of tickets to buy on this day is determined by `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, ensuring that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day and that exactly `k` tickets are bought in total.
   - The total cost is updated by adding the cost of the tickets bought on this day.
   - The number of tickets bought is incremented by the number of tickets purchased.
   - The cumulative price increase is incremented by the number of tickets purchased.

5. **Output**:
   - After the loop completes, the total cost is printed for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k` is less than or equal to `m` by purchasing all required tickets on the first day with the lowest price.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is greater than `m` by distributing the purchases over multiple days, ensuring that the cumulative price increase is correctly applied.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of a priority queue ensures that the program efficiently finds the day with the lowest current price, which is crucial for minimizing the total cost.
   - The time complexity of the program is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the heap operations, which is efficient given the constraints.

8. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - It ensures that the tickets are bought at the minimum possible cost by always choosing the day with the lowest current price and applying the cumulative price increase correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should work as intended for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
