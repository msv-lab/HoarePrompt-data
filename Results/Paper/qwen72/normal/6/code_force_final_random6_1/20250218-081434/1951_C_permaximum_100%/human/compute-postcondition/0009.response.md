Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. `pq` is now a heap containing the same tuples as before, but with the smallest tuple removed. `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` is 0. `price` is the first element of the smallest tuple in the heap plus `price_increase`. `day` is the second element of the smallest tuple in the heap. `price_increase` is 0. `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`.** 

In natural language, the `total_cost` has been updated to the product of `price` and `tickets_to_buy`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `pq`, `tickets_bought`, `price`, `day`, `price_increase`, and `tickets_to_buy` remain unchanged except for `total_cost`.
