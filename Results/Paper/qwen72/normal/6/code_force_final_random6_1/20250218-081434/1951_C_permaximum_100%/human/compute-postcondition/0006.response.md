Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. `pq` is now a heap containing the same tuples as before, but with the smallest tuple removed. `total_cost` is 0. `tickets_bought` is 0. `price_increase` is 0. `price` is the first element of the smallest tuple in the heap, and `day` is the second element of the smallest tuple in the heap.**
