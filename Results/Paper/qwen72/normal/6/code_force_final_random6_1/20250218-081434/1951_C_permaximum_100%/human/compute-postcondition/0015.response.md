Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. `pq` is now a heap containing the same tuples as before, but with the smallest tuple removed. `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` is `tickets_to_buy`. `price` is the first element of the smallest tuple in the heap plus `2 * price_increase`. `day` is the second element of the smallest tuple in the heap. `price_increase` is `tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `tickets_to_buy` is updated to the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `pq`, `total_cost`, `tickets_bought`, `price`, `day`, `price_increase`) remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` are still within their defined ranges.
- The heap `pq` still contains the same tuples as before, but with the smallest tuple removed.
- `total_cost` is still calculated as `price * tickets_to_buy`.
- `tickets_bought` is still equal to `tickets_to_buy`.
- `price` is still the first element of the smallest tuple in the heap plus `2 * price_increase`.
- `day` is still the second element of the smallest tuple in the heap.
- `price_increase` is still equal to `tickets_to_buy`.
