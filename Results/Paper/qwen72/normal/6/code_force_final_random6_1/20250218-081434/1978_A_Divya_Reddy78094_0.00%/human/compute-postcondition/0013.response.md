The code snippet `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into separate strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `nums`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers (sorted in descending order if the input was sorted in descending order).**
