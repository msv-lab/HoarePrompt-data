Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.** 

The `nums.sort(reverse=True)` operation sorts the list `nums` in descending order, which is already the case according to the initial state. Therefore, the state of `nums` remains unchanged. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`) are not affected by this code snippet.
