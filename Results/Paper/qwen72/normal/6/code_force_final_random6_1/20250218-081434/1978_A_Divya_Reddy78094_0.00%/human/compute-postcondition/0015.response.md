Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 2.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(nums[0] + nums[1])
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The list `nums` is sorted in descending order, which means the largest element is at index 0 and the second largest element is at index 1.
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of the largest and second largest elements in the list `nums`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the exact values of the elements in `nums` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of the list.
   - The output will be the sum of the largest and second largest elements in the list `nums`.

Output: **nums[0] + nums[1] (where nums[0] is the largest element and nums[1] is the second largest element in the list `nums`)**
