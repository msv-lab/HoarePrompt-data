Reasoning:  
The problem requires finding the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two non-empty piles and then reading the book with the highest number of pages in each pile. The provided program sorts the list of book pages in descending order and then sums the two largest values. This approach works because the two largest values in the list will always be the maximum pages Alice can read, regardless of how the books are divided into two piles. The program correctly handles multiple test cases and follows the input and output format specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
