Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is an input integer (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(nums[0] + nums[1])
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `nums[0]` will be the largest integer in the list `nums` because the list is sorted in descending order.
   - `nums[1]` will be the second largest integer in the list `nums` because the list is sorted in descending order.
   - The `print` statement will add these two largest integers and print the result.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the sum of the two largest integers in the list `nums`.

Output: **sum of the two largest integers in the list `nums`**
