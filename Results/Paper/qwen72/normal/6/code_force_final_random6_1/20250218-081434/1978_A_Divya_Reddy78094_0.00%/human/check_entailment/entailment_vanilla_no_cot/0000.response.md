Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums`.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list of pages in descending order using `nums.sort(reverse=True)`. This ensures that the two books with the highest number of pages are at the beginning of the list.

3. **Output**: The program prints the sum of the pages of the two books with the highest number of pages, which is `nums[0] + nums[1]`. This is the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles, as she will read the book with the highest number of pages from each pile.

The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements, ensuring that Alice reads the maximum possible number of pages. Therefore, the program is correct.
