Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of pages in each book.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def max_pages(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing the number of books `n` and the list of pages `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
