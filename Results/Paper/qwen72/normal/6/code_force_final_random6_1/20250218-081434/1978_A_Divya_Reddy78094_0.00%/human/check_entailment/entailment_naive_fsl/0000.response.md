Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums`.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list of pages in descending order using `nums.sort(reverse=True)`. This ensures that the two largest elements are at the beginning of the list.

3. **Output**: The program prints the sum of the two largest elements in the sorted list, which corresponds to the maximum number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages in each pile.

The program correctly identifies the two largest elements in the list and sums them, which is the optimal way to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read. There are no edge cases or missing logic that would cause the program to fail for any valid input.
