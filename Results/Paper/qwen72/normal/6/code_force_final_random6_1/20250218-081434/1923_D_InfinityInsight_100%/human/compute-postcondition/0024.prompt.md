Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\), `left` is a list containing the integer 0, `last` is a list of length \(n\) where the first element is -1 and subsequent elements are the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in `a` up to that point, `ans` is a list of length \(n\), where each element is -1, and `i` is \(n-1\).
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    left.append(left[-1] + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\), `left` is a list containing the integer 0 and the cumulative sum of elements from `a` up to the current index, `last` is a list of length \(n\) where the first element is -1 and subsequent elements are the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in `a` up to that point, `ans` is a list of length \(n\), where each element is -1, and `i` will be set to each element of `a` during the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\), `left` is a list containing the integer 0 and the cumulative sum of elements from `a` up to the current index, `last` is a list of length \(n\) where the first element is -1 and subsequent elements are the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in `a` up to that point, `ans` is a list of length \(n\), where each element is -1, `i` is the next element in `a`, and `left` has been updated to include a new element which is the sum of the last element in `left` and `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\), `left` is a list containing the integer 0 and the cumulative sum of elements from `a` up to the current index, with the last element being the cumulative sum up to the current index plus `i`, `last` is a list of length \(n\) where the first element is -1 and subsequent elements are the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in `a` up to that point, `ans` is a list of length \(n\), where each element is -1, `i` is the next element in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
