The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is a list of integers where the length of `a` is between 1 and 3 * 10^5, and each element `a_i` is between 1 and 10^9; and `n`, which is a non-negative integer representing the length of the list `a`.

The function returns a list `ans` of the same length `n` as the input list `a`. For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1` in the list `a`:
- If `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1.
- Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the minimum of `func_1(left, x)` and `last[i-1]`, and `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`. If `inx` is less than 0, `ans[i]` remains unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `n` representing the length of `a`. It returns a list `ans` of the same length `n`, where for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`: if `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1; otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the minimum of `func_1(left, x)` and `last[i-1]`, and `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`. If `inx` is less than 0, `ans[i]` remains unchanged.**
