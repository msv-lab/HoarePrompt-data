The code `last.append(last[-1])` appends the last element of the list `last` to itself. Given the initial state, `last` is a list containing the integers -1 and 1 if \(a[i] \neq a[i - 1]\), otherwise `last` is a list containing the integers -1 and -1. Since `i` is 2, we need to check the value of `a[2]` and `a[1]` to determine the last element of `last`.

- If \(a[2] \neq a[1]\), then `last` is initially \([-1, 1]\). After appending the last element, `last` becomes \([-1, 1, 1]\).
- If \(a[2] = a[1]\), then `last` is initially \([-1, -1]\). After appending the last element, `last` becomes \([-1, -1, -1]\).

The other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, `ans`, and `i`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 2, `left` is a list containing the integer 0, `ans` is a list of length \(n\), where each element is -1, `i` is 2, and `last` is a list containing the integers -1, 1, and 1 if \(a[2] \neq a[1]\), otherwise `last` is a list containing the integers -1, -1, and -1.**
