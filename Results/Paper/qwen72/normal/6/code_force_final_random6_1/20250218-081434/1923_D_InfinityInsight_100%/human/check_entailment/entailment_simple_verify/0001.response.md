### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten by another slime, or reporting `-1` if it is impossible.
   - Slimes can only eat their neighbors if they are strictly larger.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function takes a list `a` and an integer `x`.
     - It returns the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`, or `-1` if no such element exists.
     - The function uses `bisect_left` to find the index efficiently, which is correct.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function takes a list `a` and an integer `n` (the number of slimes).
     - It initializes `left` as a prefix sum array and `last` to keep track of the last index where the size of the slime is different from the previous one.
     - `ans` is the result array initialized to `-1` for all slimes.
     - The function iterates through the slimes from left to right:
       - If `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, it means the slime `i` can be eaten by `a[i-1]` in the next second, so `ans[i]` is set to `1`.
       - Otherwise, it calculates `x` as the total size of slimes to the left of `i` (excluding `i` itself) minus `a[i]` and `1`.
       - It then uses `func_1` to find the index of the first slime to the left of `i` whose prefix sum is greater than or equal to `x`.
       - It also checks if the last index where the size of the slime is different from the previous one (`last[i-1]`) is less than the found index.
       - If a valid index is found, it calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for slime `i` to be eaten and updates `ans[i]`.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The main loop in the program iterates through the slimes from left to right and from right to left.
   - For each slime, it calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes to be eaten from both directions and updates the result array `ans` with the minimum of the two values.
   - This ensures that the program considers both possible directions for the slimes to be eaten.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no slimes (`n = 0`), the function should return an empty list, which it does implicitly.
   - If all slimes have the same size, no slime can eat another, and all values in `ans` should remain `-1`, which is correctly handled by the program.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The prefix sum array `left` is built in `O(n)` time.
   - The `last` array is built in `O(n)` time.
   - The main loop iterates through the slimes in `O(n)` time.
   - The `bisect_left` operation inside `func_1` is `O(log n)`.
   - The overall complexity is `O(n log n)` per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where a slime can be eaten by its left neighbor in the next second.
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds for a slime to be eaten by checking the prefix sums and the last different size index.
   - The program correctly handles the case where a slime cannot be eaten by any other slime.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the slimes are processed from both directions to ensure the minimum time is found.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten or determines if it is impossible. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
