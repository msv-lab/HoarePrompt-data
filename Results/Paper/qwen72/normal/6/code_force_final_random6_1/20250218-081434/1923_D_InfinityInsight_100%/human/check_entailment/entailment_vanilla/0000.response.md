### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a line of `n` slimes, each with a size `a_i`.
   - Each second, a slime can eat one of its neighbors if it is strictly larger than the neighbor.
   - We need to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten, or report `-1` if it is impossible.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function takes an array `a` and an integer `x`.
     - It returns the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`, or `-1` if no such element exists.
     - The function uses `bisect_left` to find the index efficiently.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function takes an array `a` and an integer `n` (the number of slimes).
     - It initializes two lists: `left` and `last`.
     - `left` is a prefix sum array of the sizes of the slimes.
     - `last` keeps track of the last index where the size of the slime is different from the previous one.
     - `ans` is the result array initialized to `-1` for all slimes.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm iterates through the slimes from left to right.
   - For each slime `i`:
     - If `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, it means the slime `i` can be eaten by `a[i-1]` in the next second, so `ans[i]` is set to `1`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the total size of slimes to the left of `i` (excluding `i` itself) and subtracts `a[i]` and `1` to get `x`.
     - It then uses `func_1` to find the index of the first slime to the left of `i` whose prefix sum is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - It also checks if the last index where the size of the slime is different from the previous one (`last[i-1]`) is less than the found index.
     - If a valid index is found, it calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for slime `i` to be eaten and updates `ans[i]`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no slimes (`n = 0`), the function should return an empty list, which it does implicitly.
   - If all slimes have the same size, no slime can eat another, and all values in `ans` should remain `-1`.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The prefix sum array `left` is built in `O(n)` time.
   - The `last` array is built in `O(n)` time.
   - The main loop iterates through the slimes in `O(n)` time.
   - The `bisect_left` operation inside `func_1` is `O(log n)`.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where a slime can be eaten by its left neighbor in the next second.
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds for a slime to be eaten by checking the prefix sums and the last different size index.
   - The program correctly handles the case where a slime cannot be eaten by any other slime.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten or determines if it is impossible.

Correctness: **True**
