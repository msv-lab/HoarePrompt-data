Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `n` representing the length of `a`. It returns a list `ans` of the same length `n`. For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1` in the list `a`:
- If `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1.
- Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the minimum of the index returned by `func_1(left, x)` and `last[i-1]`, and `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`.
- If `inx` is less than 0, `ans[i]` remains unchanged.
The first element of `ans` remains -1. The function does not modify the input list `a` or the integer `n`. **
