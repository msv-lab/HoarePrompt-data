Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If the second element of `a` is less than the first element of `a`, then `ans[1]` is set to 1 and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without modifying `ans[1]`.***
