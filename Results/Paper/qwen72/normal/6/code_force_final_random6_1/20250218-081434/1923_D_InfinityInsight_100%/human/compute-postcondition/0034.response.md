Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. The second element of `a` is either less than or not less than the first element of `a`. If the second element of `a` is less than the first element, `ans[1]` is set to 1; otherwise, `ans[1]` remains unchanged. `x` is set to `left[1] - a[1] - 1`, `inx` is set to `last[0]`, and `inx2` is set to `last[0]`. The current value of `inx2` is less than or equal to the current value of `inx`.**
