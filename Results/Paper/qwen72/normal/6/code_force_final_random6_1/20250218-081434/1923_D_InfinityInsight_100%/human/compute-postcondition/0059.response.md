Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is `last[2]`, `inx2` is `last[2]`. The values of `ans[2]` and `ans[3]` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `inx = inx2` assigns the value of `inx2` to `inx`. Given that `inx2` is `last[2]`, `inx` is now also `last[2]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `x`, and the elements of `ans` remain unchanged.
