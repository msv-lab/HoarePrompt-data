You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

- If `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1.
- Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the minimum of the index returned by `func_1(left, x)` and `last[i-1]`, and `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`.
- If `inx` is less than 0, `ans[i]` remains unchanged.
The first element of `ans` remains -1. The function does not modify the input list `a` or the integer `n`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a line of `n` slimes, each with a size `a_i`.
   - Each second, a slime can eat one of its neighbors if it is strictly larger than the neighbor.
   - We need to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten, or report `-1` if it is impossible.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function takes an array `a` and an integer `x`.
     - It returns the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`, or `-1` if no such element exists.
     - The function uses `bisect_left` to find the index efficiently.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function takes an array `a` and an integer `n` (the number of slimes).
     - It initializes two lists: `left` and `last`.
     - `left` is a prefix sum array of the sizes of the slimes.
     - `last` keeps track of the last index where the size of the slime is different from the previous one.
     - `ans` is the result array initialized to `-1` for all slimes.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm iterates through the slimes from left to right.
   - For each slime `i`:
     - If `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, it means the slime `i` can be eaten by `a[i-1]` in the next second, so `ans[i]` is set to `1`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the total size of slimes to the left of `i` (excluding `i` itself) and subtracts `a[i]` and `1` to get `x`.
     - It then uses `func_1` to find the index of the first slime to the left of `i` whose prefix sum is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - It also checks if the last index where the size of the slime is different from the previous one (`last[i-1]`) is less than the found index.
     - If a valid index is found, it calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for slime `i` to be eaten and updates `ans[i]`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no slimes (`n = 0`), the function should return an empty list, which it does implicitly.
   - If all slimes have the same size, no slime can eat another, and all values in `ans` should remain `-1`.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The prefix sum array `left` is built in `O(n)` time.
   - The `last` array is built in `O(n)` time.
   - The main loop iterates through the slimes in `O(n)` time.
   - The `bisect_left` operation inside `func_1` is `O(log n)`.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where a slime can be eaten by its left neighbor in the next second.
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds for a slime to be eaten by checking the prefix sums and the last different size index.
   - The program correctly handles the case where a slime cannot be eaten by any other slime.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten or determines if it is impossible.

Correctness: **True**
