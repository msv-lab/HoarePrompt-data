Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of the current `c` (which is now 0) and the previous `maxi`.** 

The value of `c` has been reset to 0. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `maxi`) remain unchanged, except that `maxi` is now the maximum of 0 and its previous value.
