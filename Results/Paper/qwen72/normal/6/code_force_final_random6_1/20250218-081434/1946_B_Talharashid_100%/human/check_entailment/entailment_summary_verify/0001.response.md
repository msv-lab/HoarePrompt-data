Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to maximize the sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum.
   - If the array contains only non-negative numbers, the maximum subarray sum is the sum of the entire array.
   - If the array contains negative numbers, the maximum subarray sum is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray that does not include negative numbers that would decrease the sum.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program iterates through the array and maintains a running sum `c` and a maximum subarray sum `maxi`.
   - If the current element is negative and the running sum `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of the current element, it resets `c` to 0.
   - Otherwise, it adds the current element to `c` and updates `maxi` if `c` is greater than `maxi`.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the final sum as \((2^k \cdot \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum(l)}) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - This formula is derived from the idea that the maximum subarray sum can be added `k` times, but the first addition is already included in the initial sum of the array.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where the array contains only non-negative numbers.
   - It also handles cases where the array contains negative numbers and the maximum subarray sum is zero or a positive value.
   - The program correctly handles the modulo operation to ensure the result is within the required range.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program uses `2 ** k` which can be very large for large values of `k`. However, since the result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), this should not cause an overflow issue.
   - The program correctly resets `c` when encountering a negative number that would decrease the running sum, ensuring that it only considers contiguous subarrays that contribute positively to the sum.

7. **Verification**:
   - The program's logic aligns with the problem's requirements.
   - The formula used to calculate the final sum is correct based on the problem's constraints and the need to maximize the sum after `k` operations.

However, there is a critical flaw in the program's logic:
   - The formula \((2^k \cdot \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum(l)}) \mod (10^9 + 7)\) is not entirely correct. The correct formula should be \((2^k \cdot \text{maxi} + \text{sum(l)}) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - The term \(- \text{maxi}\) is unnecessary and incorrect. The maximum subarray sum should be added `k` times to the initial sum of the array, without subtracting it once.

8. **Corrected Calculation**:
   - The correct final sum should be \((2^k \cdot \text{maxi} + \text{sum(l)}) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

Given this reasoning, the original assessment is inaccurate due to the incorrect final calculation formula.

Final: **False**
