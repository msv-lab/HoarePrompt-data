Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0.** 

The value of `maxi` has been explicitly set to 0, overriding any previous value it might have had. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
