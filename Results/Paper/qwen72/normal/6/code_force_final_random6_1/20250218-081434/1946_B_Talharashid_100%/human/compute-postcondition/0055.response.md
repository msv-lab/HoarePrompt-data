To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user, with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4.
   - `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `c` is the sum of the positive elements in `l` that are not immediately preceded by a negative element whose absolute value is greater than or equal to the current sum.
   - `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` and `maxi` observed during the loop execution.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `2 ** k` is the result of raising 2 to the power of `k`.
   - `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` observed during the loop.
   - `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.

3. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.
   - This can be simplified to `(maxi * (2 ** k - 1) + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

4. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - **Calculate `2 ** k`:** This is the value of 2 raised to the power of `k`.
   - **Calculate `maxi * (2 ** k - 1)`:** Multiply `maxi` by the result of `2 ** k - 1`.
   - **Calculate `sum(l)`:** Sum all elements in the list `l`.
   - **Combine the Results:** Add the result of `maxi * (2 ** k - 1)` to `sum(l)`.
   - **Modulo Operation:** Take the result modulo 1000000007.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The final output will be the result of the expression `(maxi * (2 ** k - 1) + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `l` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables and the conditions given.

Output: **(maxi * (2 ** k - 1) + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` observed during the loop, `k` is the user-provided positive integer, and `l` is the user-provided list of integers)**
