Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele
        maxi = max(c, maxi)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, and `ele` is the first element in the list `l`. If `ele` is a negative integer and the current value of `c` (which is 0) is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, if `ele` is greater than or equal to 0 or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to `ele` and `maxi` is set to the maximum of `ele` and 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If `ele` < 0 and `c` ≤ |`ele`|, `c` is set to 0 and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and its previous value. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of `ele` and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`. If `ele` < 0 and `c` ≤ |`ele`|, `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, and `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between the updated `c` and the original `maxi`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
