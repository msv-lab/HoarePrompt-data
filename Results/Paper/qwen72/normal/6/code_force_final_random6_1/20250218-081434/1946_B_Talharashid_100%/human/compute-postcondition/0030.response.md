Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is the sum of the non-negative integers in the list `l` that have not been interrupted by a negative integer with an absolute value greater than or equal to the current sum, and `maxi` is the maximum of the current `c` and the previous `maxi`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state indicates that `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user within the specified range, and `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `c`, and `maxi` remain unchanged.
- The only change is that `l` now holds the list of integers provided by the user.
