You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with parameters in the context of a test case, where the first parameter is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of parameters for each test case. Each pair consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array and the number of operations, respectively, and a list of `n` integers `a` (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array. The sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        c = 0
        
        maxi = 0
        
        for ele in l:
            if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
                c = 0
            else:
                c += ele
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
        
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        
        print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `t-1` (where `t` is the total number of test cases), `n` and `k` are the values provided for the last test case, `l` is the list of integers provided for the last test case, `c` is the sum of the non-negative elements in the list `l` up to the last non-negative element before a negative element that resets `c` to 0, or 0 if the last element processed is negative and `c` was reset to 0, `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` encountered during the loop execution, which represents the maximum sum of contiguous non-negative elements in the list `l` before any negative element reset `c` to 0, and the final output for each test case is `(2
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of parameters, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. It returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the processing of `n`, `k`, and `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
