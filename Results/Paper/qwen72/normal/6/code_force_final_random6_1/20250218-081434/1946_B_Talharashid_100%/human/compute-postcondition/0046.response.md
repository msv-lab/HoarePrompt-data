Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If `ele` < 0 and `c` ≤ |`ele`|, `c` is set to 0 and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and its previous value. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of `ele` and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**
