Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`, `c` is 0, `maxi` remains 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `c = 0` sets the variable `c` to 0. Since this is the only change in the code, the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ele` remain unchanged. The variable `maxi` also remains 0, as no code has been executed to change its value.
