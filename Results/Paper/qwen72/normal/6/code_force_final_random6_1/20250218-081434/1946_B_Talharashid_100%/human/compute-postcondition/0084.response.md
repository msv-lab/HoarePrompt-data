Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `t-1` (where `t` is the total number of test cases), `n` and `k` are the values provided for the last test case, `l` is the list of integers provided for the last test case, `c` is the sum of the non-negative elements in the list `l` up to the last non-negative element before a negative element that resets `c` to 0, or 0 if the last element processed is negative and `c` was reset to 0, `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` encountered during the loop execution, which represents the maximum sum of contiguous non-negative elements in the list `l` before any negative element reset `c` to 0, and the final output for each test case is `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has finished executing all `t` test cases.
- The variable `i` is now `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration.
- The variables `n` and `k` hold the values provided for the last test case.
- The list `l` contains the integers provided for the last test case.
- The variable `c` is the sum of the non-negative elements in the list `l` up to the point where it was last reset by a negative element with an absolute value greater than or equal to `c`.
- The variable `maxi` is the maximum sum of contiguous non-negative elements in the list `l` before any negative element reset `c` to 0.
- The final output for each test case is the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`, which is printed for each test case.
