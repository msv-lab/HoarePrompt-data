The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of `c` and the current value of `maxi`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `c` or `maxi`. Therefore, the output state will depend on the values of `c` and `maxi`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**
