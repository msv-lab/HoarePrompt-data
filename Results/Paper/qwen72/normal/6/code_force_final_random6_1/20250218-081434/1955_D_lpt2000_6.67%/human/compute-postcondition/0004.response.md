The code `bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `bb`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6
- `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `nabors` must be greater than 0
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are now specific integers provided by the input
- `aa` is a list of integers input by the user

After executing the code, the list `bb` is populated with the integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are specific integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `nabors` must be greater than 0, `aa` is a list of integers input by the user, `bb` is a list of integers input by the user.**
