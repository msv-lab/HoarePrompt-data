Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and `nabors` must be greater than 0. `n`, `m`, and `k` are now specific integers provided by the input. `aa` is a list of integers input by the user.**
