Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are specific integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `nabors` must be greater than 0, `aa` is a list of integers input by the user, `bb` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements of `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements of `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` (i.e., the elements of `cnt_aa` that are not in `cnt_bb` or have a frequency in `cnt_aa` greater than in `cnt_bb`).**
