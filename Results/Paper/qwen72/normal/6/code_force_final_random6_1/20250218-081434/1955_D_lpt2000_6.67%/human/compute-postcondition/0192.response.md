Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n`, the window size `m`, and the threshold `k`, followed by two lists of integers `aa` and `bb`. It calculates the number of times a sliding window of size `m` in `aa` contains at least `k` elements that are also in `bb`. The function prints the count of such occurrences for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the final count of valid windows (`fnd`), the final intersection of elements (`D`), and the final counts of elements in `aa` and `bb` that are not in the intersection (`E` and `C` respectively). The original input values and lists remain unchanged. **
