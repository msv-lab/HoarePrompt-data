Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even or odd, but it does not consider the possibility of cutting the rectangle in both dimensions and forming a new rectangle. According to the problem, Bob can cut the rectangle parallel to either side, and the new rectangles formed should be able to form a different rectangle from the original one.

To determine if Bob can form a different rectangle, we need to consider the following:
1. If `a` or `b` is 1, then Bob cannot form a different rectangle because cutting a 1xN rectangle will always result in 1xM rectangles, which are the same as the original when rotated.
2. If both `a` and `b` are greater than 1, Bob can always cut the rectangle in such a way that he forms two smaller rectangles, and these two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

The current implementation only checks if `b` is even, which is insufficient. For example, for the input `2 1`, the program outputs "No" because `b` is 1, but the correct output should also be "No" because `a` is 2 and `b` is 1, and no different rectangle can be formed.

A correct implementation would need to check if either `a` or `b` is 1 and return "No" in that case, and "Yes" otherwise.

Correctness: **False**
