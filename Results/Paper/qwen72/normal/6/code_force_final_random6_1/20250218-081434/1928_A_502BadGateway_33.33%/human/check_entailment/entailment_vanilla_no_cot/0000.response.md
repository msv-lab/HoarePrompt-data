Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the original `a x b` rectangle. The logic should consider both dimensions `a` and `b` and whether either of them can be cut into two equal parts to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

The correct logic should be:
- If either `a` or `b` is even and greater than 1, Bob can form a different rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are 1, Bob cannot form a different rectangle.
- If one dimension is 1 and the other is odd, Bob cannot form a different rectangle.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    if a == 1 and b == 1:
        return 'no'
    if a > 1 and a % 2 == 0:
        return 'yes'
    if b > 1 and b % 2 == 0:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'
```

This version correctly checks all the conditions and should produce the correct output for the given problem.
