Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged (including rotations) to form a different rectangle. The key is to check if the original rectangle can be transformed into a new one with a different aspect ratio.

2. **Analyzing the Solution**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) of the rectangle.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(a, b)` to determine if Bob can form another rectangle.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` returns 'yes' if \(b\) is even and 'no' otherwise.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` checks if \(b\) is even. If \(b\) is even, it means the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\).
   - After cutting, Bob can rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle of size \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\).
   - The new rectangle \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\) will have a different aspect ratio from the original \(a \times b\) if \(a \neq b\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), the rectangle cannot be cut, and the function correctly returns 'no'.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), the rectangle can only be cut into two \(1 \times 1\) rectangles, and the function correctly returns 'no'.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 6\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function correctly returns 'yes'.
   - If \(a = 3\) and \(b = 2\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function correctly returns 'yes'.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(1 \times 2\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(1 \times 4\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function correctly returns 'yes'.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 4\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function correctly returns 'yes'.
   - If \(a = 6\) and \(b = 3\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(6 \times 1.5\) rectangles, but since \(b\) is not even, the function correctly returns 'no'.

5. **Challenging the Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` only checks if \(b\) is even. However, the problem also requires checking if \(a\) is even, as cutting the rectangle along the other dimension (parallel to \(a\)) should also be considered.
   - For example, if \(a = 4\) and \(b = 3\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(6 \times 2\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function would incorrectly return 'no' in this case because it only checks \(b\).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic of checking if \(b\) is even is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle with a different aspect ratio.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is missing the check for \(a\) being even, which is necessary to handle all cases correctly.

Final: **False**
