The code snippet `x = min(a, b)` assigns the minimum value between `a` and `b` to the variable `x`. Given the initial state, `a` and `b` are the new first and last elements that were removed from the deque `nums`, respectively. The value of `x` is now the smaller of these two values. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing `n-4` or `n-3` or `n-2` positive integers where 1 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9, `ans` is 0 or 1 or 2, `a` is the new first element that was removed from the left of `nums`, `b` is the new last element that was removed from the right of `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, `k` is non-zero, and `len(nums)` is at least 2.**
