Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing `n` positive integers where 1 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9.** 

The list `nums` has been converted into a deque, which allows for efficient appending and popping from both ends. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the elements in `nums` are still positive integers within the specified range.
