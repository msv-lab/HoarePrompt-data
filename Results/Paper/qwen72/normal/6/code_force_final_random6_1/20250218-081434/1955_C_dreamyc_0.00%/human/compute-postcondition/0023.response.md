Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing `n-4` or `n-3` or `n-2` positive integers where 1 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9, `ans` is 0 or 1 or 2, `a` is the new first element that was removed from the left of `nums`, `b` is the new last element that was removed from the right of `nums`, `x` is the minimum of the new `a` and `b`, `k` is non-zero, and `len(nums)` is at least 2.**

Explanation:
- `a` and `b` are updated to the new first and last elements removed from `nums` respectively.
- `nums` has two elements removed, so its length is now `n-4` if it initially had `n-2` elements, `n-3` if it initially had `n-1` elements, or `n-2` if it initially had `n` elements.
- `x` is updated to the minimum of the new `a` and `b`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
