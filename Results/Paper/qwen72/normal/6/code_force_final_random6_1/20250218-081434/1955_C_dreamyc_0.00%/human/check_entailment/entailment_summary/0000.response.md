Reasoning:
The program is designed to simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships and count how many ships sink as a result. The function `func_1` uses a deque to efficiently manage the ships' durabilities, allowing it to pop from both ends of the list (representing the first and last ships) and append back any remaining durability values after an attack.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function converts `nums` to a deque to facilitate efficient popping and appending.
   - It initializes a counter `ans` to keep track of the number of sunk ships.
   - The while loop continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and at least two ships remain (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - In each iteration, it pops the first and last ship durabilities (`a` and `b`).
   - It calculates the minimum durability between the two ships (`x`).
   - If the remaining attacks `k` are sufficient to reduce both `a` and `b` by `x`, it does so and decrements `k` by `2 * x`.
   - If `a` or `b` still have positive durability after the attack, they are appended back to the deque.
   - If a ship's durability is reduced to 0, the counter `ans` is incremented.
   - After the while loop, if there is exactly one ship left and enough attacks to sink it, `ans` is incremented by 1.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Execution Summary:
- The function correctly handles the alternating attacks on the first and last ships.
- It ensures that ships with 0 durability are not re-attacked.
- The function correctly accounts for the remaining attacks and the final ship if only one remains.
- The use of a deque allows for efficient operations, which is crucial given the constraints.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Ship:** The function correctly handles the case where there is only one ship left and enough attacks to sink it.
- **No Ships Left:** The function correctly handles the case where all ships are sunk before the attacks are exhausted.
- **Large `k` and `n`:** The function efficiently reduces the number of attacks and durabilities, ensuring it can handle large inputs within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately. The execution summary aligns with the expected behavior of the function.

Correctness: **True**
