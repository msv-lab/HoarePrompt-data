Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing `n-4` or `n-3` or `n-2` positive integers where 1 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9, `ans` is 0 or 1 or 2, `a` is the new first element that was removed from the left of `nums`, `b` is the new last element that was removed from the right of `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, `k` is non-zero, and `len(nums)` is at least 2. If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, then `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
