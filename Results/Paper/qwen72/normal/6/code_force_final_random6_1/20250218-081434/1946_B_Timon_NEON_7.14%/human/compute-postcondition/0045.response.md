Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing two elements: the first element is [arr[1], 1, 0] if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `arr[1]`, otherwise it is [0, 0, -1]; the second element is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0, 1].**

Explanation:
- The value of `max_segment[0]` is updated by adding `arr[2]` to it.
- The initial value of `max_segment[0]` was `arr[0] + arr[1]`.
- After adding `arr[2]`, the new value of `max_segment[0]` is `arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
