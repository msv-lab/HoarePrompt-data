Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing one or two elements. If `arr[2]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, and `segments_variants` contains two elements: the first element is [arr[1], 1, 0] if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `arr[1]`, otherwise it is [0, 0, -1]; the second element is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0, 1]. If `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is [arr[1] + arr[2], 1] if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` is [arr[2], 0], and `segments_variants` contains one element which is [arr[1], 1, 0] if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `arr[1]`, otherwise it is [0, 0, -1].***
