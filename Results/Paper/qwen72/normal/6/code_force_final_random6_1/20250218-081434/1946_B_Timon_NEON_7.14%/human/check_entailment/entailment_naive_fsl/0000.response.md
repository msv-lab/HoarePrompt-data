Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program is incomplete and does not fully implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Specifically, `func_3` is not implemented to perform the required operations. Additionally, the logic in `func_2` does not correctly handle the task of finding the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations. For example, the program does not consider the case where the entire array is negative and the optimal strategy might be to insert the sum of an empty subarray multiple times. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
