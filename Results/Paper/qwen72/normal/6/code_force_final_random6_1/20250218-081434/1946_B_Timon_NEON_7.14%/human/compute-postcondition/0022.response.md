Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is [arr[0], 0]. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains an empty list.***
