### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final answer should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function correctly returns the modulo of a given number with \(10^9 + 7\).
     - The implementation is straightforward and correct.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - The function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
     - However, the function has several issues:
       - It does not correctly handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers.
       - The logic for updating `segments_variants` and `max_segment` is flawed. For example, it does not properly reset `max_segment` when a new segment starts.
       - The function returns a segment with a sum of \(-1\) if no valid segment is found, which is incorrect for the problem's requirements.
     - The function also appends `new_segment` and `max_segment` to `segments_variants` even if `new_segment` is empty, which can lead to incorrect results.

   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
     - This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operations.
     - It is supposed to compute the final answer based on the maximum segment sum and the number of operations, but it is not implemented.

3. **Main Program:**
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_2` to find the maximum sum segment.
   - If the maximum sum segment is \(-1\), it sets the maximum sum to 0.
   - It then computes the final answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The formula used is incorrect. The correct formula should be `sum(a) + max_segment[0] * (2 ** k - 1)` to account for the repeated insertion of the maximum segment sum.

4. **Expected Implementation:**
   - Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - If the maximum sum is positive, the final sum after `k` operations will be the initial sum of the array plus the maximum sum multiplied by \((2^k - 1)\).
   - If the maximum sum is non-positive, the final sum will be the initial sum of the array.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because:
- **Function 2** does not correctly find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
- **Function 3** is incomplete and does not perform the required operations.
- The main program uses an incorrect formula to compute the final answer.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
