To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which are `segment` and `segments_variants`. The loop will execute if `segments_variants` is not empty. Given the initial state, we need to ensure that `segments_variants` contains at least one segment for the loop to start.

Let's break down the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9.
- `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `max_sum` is -1.
- `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found during the loop.
- `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that were considered but not chosen as the `max_segment`.
- `new_segment` is an empty list if the last element of `arr` is less than 0, otherwise it is a list containing the sum of the last segment and the index of the last element in that segment.
- `segments_variants` now includes an additional segment, which is the `new_segment` appended with the index `len(arr) - 1`.
- `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.

For the loop to execute, `segments_variants` must contain at least one segment. The `new_segment` is appended to `segments_variants` with the index `len(arr) - 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `new_segment` is not empty, which depends on the value of the last element in `arr`.

If the last element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` will be a list containing the sum of the last segment and the index of the last element in that segment. This will ensure that `segments_variants` is not empty.

If the last element of `arr` is less than 0, `new_segment` will be an empty list, and `segments_variants` will also be empty, which would prevent the loop from executing.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state so that `new_segment` is not empty. This can be achieved by ensuring that the last element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found during the loop, `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that were considered but not chosen as the `max_segment`, `new_segment` is a list containing the sum of the last segment and the index of the last element in that segment, `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`, and the last element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0**.
