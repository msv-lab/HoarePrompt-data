### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final answer should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function correctly returns the modulo of a given number with \(10^9 + 7\).
     - It is a straightforward and correct implementation.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - The function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
     - However, the logic is flawed:
       - It does not handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers correctly.
       - The way it updates `segments_variants` and `max_segment` is incorrect. It does not properly reset `max_segment` when a new segment starts.
       - The function returns a segment with a sum of \(-1\) if no valid segment is found, which is incorrect for the problem's requirements.
     - **Example Issues:**
       - For an array with all negative numbers, the function should return the maximum subarray sum, which is 0 (an empty subarray), but it returns \(-1\).
       - For an array with positive and negative numbers, the function may not find the correct maximum subarray sum due to incorrect segment handling.

   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
     - The function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operations.
     - It is supposed to compute the final answer based on the maximum segment sum and the number of operations, but it is not implemented.
     - **Function Summary Verification:**
       - The summary states that `func_3` always returns 0, which is correct based on the provided code. However, this is not the correct behavior for the problem.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations, we need to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray using Kadane's algorithm.
   - If the maximum sum is positive, the final sum after `k` operations will be the initial sum of the array plus the maximum sum multiplied by `k`.
   - If the maximum sum is non-positive, the final sum will be the initial sum of the array (since inserting a non-positive sum or an empty subarray sum of 0 will not increase the total sum).

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because:
- **Function 2** does not correctly find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
- **Function 3** is incomplete and does not perform the required operations.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
