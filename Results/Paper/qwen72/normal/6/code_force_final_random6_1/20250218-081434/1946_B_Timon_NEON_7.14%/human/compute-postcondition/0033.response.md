Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0] if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [0] if `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `new_segment[0]`, otherwise it is [0, 0, -1].**

Explanation:
- `new_segment[0]` is updated by adding `arr[i]` to it. Initially, `new_segment[0]` is `arr[0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` is an empty list.
- `i` is 1, so `arr[i]` is `arr[1]`.
- Therefore, `new_segment[0]` becomes `arr[0] + arr[1]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0.
- The value of `max_segment` is `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]` regardless of the value of `arr[0]`.
- The value of `segments_variants` depends on whether `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`:
  - If `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` is `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0, 0]`.
  - Otherwise, `segments_variants` is `[0, 0, -1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
