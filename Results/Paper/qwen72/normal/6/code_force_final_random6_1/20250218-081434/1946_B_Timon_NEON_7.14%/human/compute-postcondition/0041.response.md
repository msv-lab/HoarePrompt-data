Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is [arr[1], 1] if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [arr[1], 1, 0] if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `arr[1]`, otherwise it is [0, 0, -1]. `segments_variants` now contains an additional element which is `new_segment` appended with the value 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])` appends a new element to the `segments_variants` list.
- The new element is `new_segment` concatenated with the value `[i - 1]`, which is `[2 - 1]` or `[1]`.
- If `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is `[arr[1], 1]`, and the new element appended to `segments_variants` is `[arr[1], 1, 1]`.
- If `arr[1]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list `[]`, and the new element appended to `segments_variants` is `[1]`.
- The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, `new_segment`, and `max_segment`) remain unchanged.
