Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a list `total_max_segment`. This list contains the sum of the maximum sum segment found in `arr` and the start and end indices of this segment. If no valid segment is found (i.e., all elements in `arr` are negative), the function returns `[-1]`. **
