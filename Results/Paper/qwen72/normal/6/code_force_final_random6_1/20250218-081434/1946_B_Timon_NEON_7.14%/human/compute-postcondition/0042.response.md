Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is [arr[1], 1] if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is now equal to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [arr[1], 1, 0] if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `arr[1]`, otherwise it is [0, 0, -1]. `segments_variants` now contains an additional element which is `new_segment` appended with the value 1.**
