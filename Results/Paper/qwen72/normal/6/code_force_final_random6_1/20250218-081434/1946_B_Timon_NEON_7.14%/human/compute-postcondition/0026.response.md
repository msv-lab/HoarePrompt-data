Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is [arr[0], 0] if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `new_segment` + [0] if `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `new_segment[0]`, otherwise it is [0, 0, -1], and the second element is `max_segment` + [0].**

Explanation: The code appends `max_segment + [i - 1]` to the `segments_variants` list. Since `i` is 1, `i - 1` is 0. Therefore, the new element appended to `segments_variants` is `max_segment` + [0], which is `[arr[0], 0, 0]`. The initial element in `segments_variants` remains unchanged.
