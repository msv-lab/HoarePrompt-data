### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final answer should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function correctly returns the modulo of a given number with \(10^9 + 7\).
     - It is a straightforward and correct implementation.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
     - However, the function has several issues:
       - It does not correctly handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers.
       - The logic for updating `segments_variants` and `max_segment` is flawed. For example, it does not properly reset `max_segment` when a new segment starts.
       - The function returns a segment with a sum of \(-1\) if no valid segment is found, which is incorrect for the problem's requirements.

   - **Main Loop:**
     - The main loop reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It calls `func_2` to find the maximum segment sum.
     - If the maximum segment sum is \(-1\), it sets the maximum segment sum to 0.
     - It then computes the final answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
     - This formula is incorrect because it does not properly account for the maximum sum subarray and the number of operations.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations, we need to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - If the maximum sum is positive, the final sum after `k` operations will be the initial sum of the array plus the maximum sum multiplied by `k`.
   - If the maximum sum is non-positive, the final sum will be the initial sum of the array.

4. **Expected Implementation:**
   - Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - If the maximum sum is positive, the final sum after `k` operations will be the initial sum of the array plus the maximum sum multiplied by `k`.
   - If the maximum sum is non-positive, the final sum will be the initial sum of the array.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because:
- **Function 2** does not correctly find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
- The main loop uses an incorrect formula to compute the final answer.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
