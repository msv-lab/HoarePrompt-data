Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is [arr[2], 2], `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [arr[1], 1, 0] if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `arr[1]`, otherwise it is [0, 0, -1].**

Explanation:
- `new_segment` is updated to `[arr[2], 2]` because `i` is 2.
- All other variables (`arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
