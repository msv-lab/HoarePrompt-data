The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which we can denote as `t` for the sake of clarity. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `t`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 (input value).
- `i` is 1.
- `y` is `x - 1` which is an integer such that 1 <= y <= 999 (based on the new value of `x`).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `i` is 2, `y` is `x - 1` which is an integer such that 1 <= y <= 999, `t` must be greater than 2**
