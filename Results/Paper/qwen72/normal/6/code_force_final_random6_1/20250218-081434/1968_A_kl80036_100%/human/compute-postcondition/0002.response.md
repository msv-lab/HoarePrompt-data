Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each of the t test cases, `i` is 0, `y` is `x - 1` which is an integer such that 1 <= y <= 999.** 

The value of `y` is now `x - 1`, where `x` is an integer between 2 and 1000. Therefore, `y` will be an integer between 1 and 999. The values of `t`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.
