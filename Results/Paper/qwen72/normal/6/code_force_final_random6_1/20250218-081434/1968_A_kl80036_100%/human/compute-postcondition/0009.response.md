Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `y` is `x - 1` which is an integer such that 1 <= y <= 999, `t` must be greater than 2.** 

The value of `x` is updated to the integer provided by the user input. The values of `t`, `i`, and `y` remain unchanged, but `y` is still dependent on the new value of `x`. The condition that `t` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
