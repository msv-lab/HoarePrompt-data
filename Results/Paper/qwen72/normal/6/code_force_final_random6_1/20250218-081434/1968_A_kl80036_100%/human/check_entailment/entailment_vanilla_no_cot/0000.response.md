Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct for the problem description provided. The program aims to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The key insight here is that for any \( x \), the value \( y = x - 1 \) will always maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) because:

1. \( \gcd(x, x-1) \) is always 1, since \( x \) and \( x-1 \) are consecutive integers and thus coprime.
2. Therefore, \( \gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x \).

Since \( x \) is the maximum possible value for \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) when \( 1 \le y < x \), the choice of \( y = x - 1 \) is optimal. The program correctly implements this logic and outputs \( x - 1 \) for each test case, which satisfies the problem requirements.
