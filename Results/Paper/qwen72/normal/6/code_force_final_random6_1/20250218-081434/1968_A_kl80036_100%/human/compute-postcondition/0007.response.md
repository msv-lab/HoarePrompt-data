Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `y` is defined as `x - 1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(y)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `y`:**
   - Since `y` is defined as `x - 1`, and `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\), the value of `y` will be \(1 \leq y \leq 999\).

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(y)` statement will print the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`.

Output: **y (where y is the value of x - 1 and x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000)**
