The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in its definition, but based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts two parameters: `t` and `x`. Here, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 <= t <= 1000. For each of these `t` test cases, `x` is an integer with the constraint 2 <= x <= 1000. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the value of `x` for each test case.

However, since the specific output is not provided, we can only describe the input parameters and the general structure of the function's expected behavior.
