You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is `t - 1`, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each of the t test cases, `y` is `x - 1` which is an integer such that 1 <= y <= 999 for each of the t test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the value \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The function \( \gcd(x, y) \) is the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - For any integer \( x \), the value \( y = x - 1 \) is the largest possible value for \( y \) that satisfies \( 1 \le y < x \).
   - The greatest common divisor \( \gcd(x, x-1) \) is always 1 because \( x \) and \( x-1 \) are consecutive integers, and consecutive integers are coprime (they have no common divisors other than 1).

3. **Expression Evaluation**:
   - When \( y = x - 1 \), the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) becomes \( \gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) \).
   - Since \( \gcd(x, x-1) = 1 \), the expression simplifies to \( 1 + (x-1) = x \).

4. **Maximizing the Expression**:
   - For any \( y \) in the range \( 1 \le y < x \), the value \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) will be less than or equal to \( x \) because \( \gcd(x, y) \le x \) and \( y < x \).
   - Therefore, \( y = x - 1 \) always maximizes the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

5. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It then sets \( y = x - 1 \) and prints \( y \).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly finds and prints \( y = x - 1 \) for each test case.
   - This \( y \) always satisfies the condition \( 1 \le y < x \) and maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct because it always finds the value \( y = x - 1 \), which is the largest possible \( y \) that satisfies \( 1 \le y < x \) and maximizes the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
