### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Operation Logic**:
   - The program attempts to perform the operation on elements that are greater than 10 and out of order.
   - It iterates through the array and checks if the current element is less than the previous element and if the previous element is greater than 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array in the correct positions.

3. **Sorting Check**:
   - After potentially performing the operations, the program checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function compares the list `lst` with its sorted version `sorted_lst` and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating that the list is sorted.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the array is already sorted correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the array contains elements that are less than 10, as these elements are not modified.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program only performs the operation once if it finds an out-of-order element greater than 10. This might not be sufficient to ensure the array is sorted, especially if multiple elements need to be split and rearranged.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. After splitting `12` into `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, the array is still not sorted. The program should continue to check and split elements until no more operations are needed or the array is sorted.

### Conclusion:
The program is **incorrect** because it does not handle multiple operations correctly. It only performs the operation once and does not ensure that the array is fully sorted after all necessary operations.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
