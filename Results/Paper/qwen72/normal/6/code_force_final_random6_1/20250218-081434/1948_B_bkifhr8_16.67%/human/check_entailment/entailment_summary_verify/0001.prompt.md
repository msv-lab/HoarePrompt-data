You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers, where each integer is in the range 0 to 99, inclusive. It returns a boolean value indicating whether `lst` is already sorted in ascending order. If `lst` is sorted, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the original list `lst`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Operation Simulation**:
   - The program iterates through the array to check if any element is out of order and greater than 10.
   - If such an element is found, it splits the element into its digits and inserts them back into the array at the correct positions.
   - This operation is performed using the `pop` and `insert` methods, which correctly remove the element and insert its digits.

3. **Sorting Check**:
   - After performing the operations, the program checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to a sorted version of itself.
   - The function `func_1` is used to perform this check. It sorts the list and compares it to the original list.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'Yes' if the array is sorted, and 'No' otherwise.

### Issues:
- **Incomplete Operation Simulation**:
  - The program only performs the operation once for the first out-of-order element greater than 10. This is insufficient because the operation might need to be applied multiple times to different elements to achieve a sorted array.
  - For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The program will split `12` into `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]` but will not split `45` into `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`, which is necessary to achieve a sorted array.

- **Incorrect Condition**:
  - The condition `if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:` is not sufficient to ensure that the array can be sorted. It only checks if the current element is out of order and greater than 10, but it does not consider the possibility of multiple elements needing to be split.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not handle the case where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array. It only performs the operation once, which is not enough to solve the problem as described.

### Correctness: **False**
