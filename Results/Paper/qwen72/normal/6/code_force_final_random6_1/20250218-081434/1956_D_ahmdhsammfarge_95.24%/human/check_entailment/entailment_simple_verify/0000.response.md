### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - **Problem Description:** The function should find the optimal range `[l, r]` to maximize the sum of the array elements by computing the MEX value for the chosen range and then applying the operation.
   - **Actual Implementation:** The function `func_1` does not compute the MEX value. Instead, it computes a sum that includes the square of the length of the subarray, which is not the correct approach according to the problem statement. The sum calculation `sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2` is incorrect because it does not consider the MEX value of the subarray `lst[i:j+1]`.
   - **Conclusion:** The function `func_1` is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - **Problem Description:** The function should append operations to the `ops` list to transform the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` such that the MEX value of the subarray is applied to all elements in the subarray.
   - **Actual Implementation:** The function `func_2` recursively appends operations to `ops` but does not actually compute the MEX value or apply it to the subarray. It simply appends the same operation multiple times, which is not the correct behavior.
   - **Conclusion:** The function `func_2` is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
   - **Problem Description:** The function should apply the operation to the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` by computing the MEX value and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value. It should also append the operations to the `ops` list.
   - **Actual Implementation:** The function `func_3` appends operations to `ops` and modifies the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` to a constant value `n` (which is the length of the subarray). This is not the correct behavior because it does not compute the MEX value and does not set the subarray elements to the MEX value.
   - **Conclusion:** The function `func_3` is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Main Program:**
   - **Problem Description:** The main program should repeatedly apply the operation to maximize the sum of the array elements and output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.
   - **Actual Implementation:** The main program uses the incorrect functions `func_1` and `func_3` to find and apply the operations. It also has a loop that attempts to set all zeros to ones, which is not part of the problem's requirements and may lead to incorrect results.
   - **Conclusion:** The main program is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the required operations to maximize the sum of the array elements. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not correctly compute the MEX value or apply the operations as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
