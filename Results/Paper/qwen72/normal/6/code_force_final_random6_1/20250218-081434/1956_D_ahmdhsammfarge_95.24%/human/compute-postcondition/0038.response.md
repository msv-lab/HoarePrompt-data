The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `lst`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `lst` must still be a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 18.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is `len(lst) - 1`
- `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` will be incremented to 2
- `lst` must still be a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 18

The state of `j` and `sm` are not directly modified by the loop head, so they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, but `sm` will be recalculated in the loop body based on the new value of `i`.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, `i` is 2, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`**
