Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, `r` is the starting index of the subarray that maximizes the sum of the remaining elements plus the square of the subarray's length, `l` is the ending index of this subarray, and `over_sum` is the maximum value of this sum found during the loop.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The list `lst` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- The variables `r` and `l` are set to the indices of the subarray that, when removed, maximizes the sum of the remaining elements plus the square of the length of the removed subarray.
- The variable `over_sum` is updated to the maximum value of this sum found during the loop.
- The loop iterates over all possible subarrays of `lst`, and the final values of `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` reflect the best subarray found according to the given condition.
