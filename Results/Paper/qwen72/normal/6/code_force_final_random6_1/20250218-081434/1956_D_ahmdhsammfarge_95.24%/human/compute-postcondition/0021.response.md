The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `i + 1` and `len(lst)`. For the loop to execute, `i + 1` must be less than `len(lst)`. Given that `i` is 1, `len(lst)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute. 

At the start of the loop, `j` should be initialized to `i + 1`, which is 2. The list `lst` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 2 ≤ n ≤ 18, `r` is 0, `l` is the index j where the condition `sm > over_sum` was last satisfied, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
