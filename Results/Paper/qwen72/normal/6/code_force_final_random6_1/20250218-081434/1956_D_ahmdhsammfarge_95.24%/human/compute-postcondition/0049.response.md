Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `5 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `sm` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index 5 to the end of `lst` plus 9. If `sm` > `over_sum`, `over_sum` is updated to `sm` and `l` is 4. Otherwise, `over_sum` remains unchanged and `l` is 3.***
