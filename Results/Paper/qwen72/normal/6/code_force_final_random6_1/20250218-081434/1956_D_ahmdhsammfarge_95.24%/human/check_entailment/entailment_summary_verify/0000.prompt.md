You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                (r, l) = [i, j]
                over_sum = sm
    return (r, l)

#Function 2:
def func_2(r, l, ops: list):
    if r == l:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)

#Function 3:
def func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`, where `r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list of operation ranges. It appends the operation range `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` multiple times, and if the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, it appends the same range again. The function then calls another function `func_2` with `r`, `l`, and `ops`. Finally, it fills the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` with the value `n`, where `n` is `l - r + 1`, ensuring the minimum value in this sublist is `n`. The function returns the modified `lst`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required operations to maximize the sum of the array elements. Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to find the optimal range `[l, r]` to maximize the sum, but it does not correctly compute the MEX value for the chosen range. The MEX value is not considered in the sum calculation, which is a critical part of the problem description. Additionally, the functions `func_2` and `func_3` are not correctly structured to perform the operations as described. For example, the function `func_3` modifies the list and appends operations to `ops` in a way that does not align with the problem's requirements.

A specific case where the program fails is:
```
Input:
3
1 3 9

Expected Output:
13 0

Actual Output:
The program does not correctly compute the MEX value and may produce an incorrect sequence of operations or sum.
```

The program should be able to handle all potential cases, including those where the MEX value is crucial for maximizing the sum. Since the provided code does not correctly handle the MEX computation and the sequence of operations, it is incorrect.
