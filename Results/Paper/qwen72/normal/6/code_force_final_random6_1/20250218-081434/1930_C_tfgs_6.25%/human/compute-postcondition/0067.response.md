The function `func_1` seems to be missing the parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`.

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

Given these parameters, the function should return a result based on the input values. However, the specific output or return value is not provided in the problem statement. Assuming the function processes the list `a` in some way and returns a result, we can describe the functionality in a general sense.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers. The function processes the list `a` and returns a result based on the input values, with the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding \(3 \cdot 10^5\).**
