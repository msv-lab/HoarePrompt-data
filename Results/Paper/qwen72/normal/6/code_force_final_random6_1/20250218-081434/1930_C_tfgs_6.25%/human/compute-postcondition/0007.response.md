Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is 2, `a[0]` is increased by 1, `a[1]` is increased by 2, `a[2]` is increased by 3.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i] += i + 1` increments the value of `a[2]` by 3, because `i` is 2.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and the conditions on `a` remain unchanged.
- The previous increments to `a[0]` and `a[1]` are still valid.
- Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `a[2]` and all other initial conditions.
