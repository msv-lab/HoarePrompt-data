The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` starts at 0, which is the default behavior of `range(n)`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is 0**
