Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and after the loop, each `a[i]` is increased by `i + 1` for all 0 ≤ i < n; `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the list `a`.**
