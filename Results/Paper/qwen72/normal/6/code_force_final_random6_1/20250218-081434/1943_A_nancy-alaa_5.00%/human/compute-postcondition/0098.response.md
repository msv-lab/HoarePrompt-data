The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `first` is True. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which means `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `first` is True**
