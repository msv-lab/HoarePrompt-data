Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, the program continues without any changes to `n` or `i`. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `n` or `i`. `first` is True.**

The variable `first` is set to `True`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged from the initial state.
