Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `n` or `i`.**

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition regarding `i` being in `mpp.keys()` still holds true.
