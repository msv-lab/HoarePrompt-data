Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `first` is True if there exists at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once and is encountered before the loop breaks, otherwise `first` is False, and the loop will execute again if the input integer is greater than the current value of `_`.**
