Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and the list `arr`.

2. **Counter Usage**: The function uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`. This is a valid and efficient way to track the frequency of elements.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The function iterates through the range `0` to `n-1` to find the MEX.
   - It checks if the current integer `i` is missing from `arr` (i.e., `i not in mpp.keys()`). If `i` is missing, it prints `i` and breaks the loop, which is the correct behavior for finding the MEX.
   - If `i` is present and occurs exactly once, it checks if `first` is `True`. If `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. If `first` is `False`, it sets `first` to `True`.

4. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The function correctly identifies the smallest integer `i` that is either missing or occurs exactly once and is the first such integer encountered. This aligns with the optimal strategy for both players:
     - Alice will always try to pick the smallest missing integer or the smallest integer that occurs exactly once.
     - Bob will try to prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX by picking the smallest integer that occurs exactly once if it is not already picked by Alice.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where all integers from `0` to `n-1` are present in `arr` by printing the smallest integer that occurs exactly once.
   - If no such integer exists, the function will print the smallest missing integer, which is also correct.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the MEX for each test case, which is the expected output.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally.

Correctness: **True**
