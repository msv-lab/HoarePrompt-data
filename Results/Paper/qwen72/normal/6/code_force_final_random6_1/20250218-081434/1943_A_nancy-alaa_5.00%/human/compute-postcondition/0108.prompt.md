Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The total number of test cases t is provided, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mpp = Counter(arr)
    first = False
    for i in range(n):
        if i not in mpp.keys():
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1:
            first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer (n ≥ 1), `i` is `n-1`, `first` is True if there exists at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once and is encountered before the loop breaks, otherwise `first` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `first` is True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that occurs exactly once and is less than `n`, otherwise `first` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `first` is True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
