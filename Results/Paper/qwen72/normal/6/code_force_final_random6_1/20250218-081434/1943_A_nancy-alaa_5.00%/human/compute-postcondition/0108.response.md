Output State: **After all iterations, `n` remains unchanged for each test case, `i` is `n-1` for the last iteration of each test case, and `first` is True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that occurs exactly once and is less than `n` for each test case.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for each test case, and within each test case, it iterates `n` times.
- The variable `n` is the number of elements in the list `arr` for each test case and does not change throughout the execution of the loop for that test case.
- The variable `i` increments from 0 to `n-1` during the loop's execution for each test case, and it will be `n-1` at the last iteration of the loop for that test case.
- The variable `first` is set to True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once and is less than `n`. If such an integer is found and the loop does not break before the last iteration, `first` will be True at the end of the loop for that test case. If no such integer is found, `first` will be False.
