Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

The values of `n`, `k`, and `m` are updated based on the input provided. The initial constraints for `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain valid, and `s` is still a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases still does not exceed 10^6.
