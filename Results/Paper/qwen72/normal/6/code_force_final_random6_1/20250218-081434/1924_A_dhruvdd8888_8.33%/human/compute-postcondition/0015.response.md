The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first character of `s`, and `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next character in `s`. Since `s` is a string of length `m` and the loop has already processed the first character, the next character to be processed is the second character of `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the second character of `s`. If the second character of `s` is in `us` and the length of `win` is equal to `k`, then `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s`, and `ps` is 1. Otherwise, if the second character of `s` is in `us`, `win` is a set containing the first character of `s`, `ans` is an empty list, and `ps` is 0. If the second character of `s` is not in `us`, the state of `win`, `ans`, and `ps` remains unchanged.**
