Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing all characters from `s` that were added to `win` when `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters, and `ps` is the number of times `win` was cleared (i.e., the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters).**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`**: These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`win`**: After all iterations, `win` is an empty set because every time `win` contains exactly `k` unique characters, it is cleared.
- **`ans`**: This list contains all characters from `s` that were added to `win` when `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters. Each time `win` reaches `k` unique characters, the current character `i` is appended to `ans`.
- **`ps`**: This variable counts the number of times `win` was cleared, which is equivalent to the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters. Each time `win` is cleared, `ps` is incremented by 1.
