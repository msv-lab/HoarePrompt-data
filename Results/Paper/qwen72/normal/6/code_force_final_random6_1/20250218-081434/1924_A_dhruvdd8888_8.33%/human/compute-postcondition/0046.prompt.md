You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing all characters from `s` that were added to `win` when `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters, and `ps` is the number of times `win` was cleared (i.e., the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters).
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns None.
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing all characters from `s` that were added to `win` when `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters, and `ps` is the number of times `win` was cleared (i.e., the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters). Additionally, `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing all characters from `s` that were added to `win` when `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters, `ps` is the number of times `win` was cleared (i.e., the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters), and `ps` is less than `n`. The loop has printed a string for each element `i` in `us` that was not in `win`, where the string is `ans` concatenated with `i` and then padded with `a` to make the total length `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It prints 'YES' and returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program prints 'YES' and returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
