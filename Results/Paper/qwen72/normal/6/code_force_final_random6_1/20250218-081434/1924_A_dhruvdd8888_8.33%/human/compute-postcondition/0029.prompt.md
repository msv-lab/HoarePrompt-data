Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is an empty list, `ps` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in us:
        win.add(i)
        if len(win) == k:
            ans.append(i)
            ps += 1
            win.clear()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the first character of `s`. If `i` is in `us` and the length of `win` is equal to `k`, then `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s`, and `ps` is 1. Otherwise, if `i` is in `us`, `win` is a set containing the first character of `s`, `ans` is an empty list, and `ps` is 0. If `i` is not in `us`, the state of `win`, `ans`, and `ps` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the second character of `s`. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) == k`, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the first and second characters of `s`, and `ps` is 2. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) != k`, `win` is a set containing the first and second characters of `s`, `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s`, and `ps` is 1. If `i` is not in `us`, the state of `win`, `ans`, and `ps` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the third character of `s`. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) == k`, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the first, second, and third characters of `s`, and `ps` is 3. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) != k`, `win` is a set containing the first, second, and third characters of `s`, `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s`, and `ps` is 1. If `i` is not in `us`, the state of `win`, `ans`, and `ps` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
