The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the set `us`. For the loop to execute, the set `us` must contain at least one element. The variable `i` will take on each value in `us` during the loop iterations.

Given the initial state:
- `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `k` is an input integer.

For the loop to execute, `us` must be non-empty, which means `k` must be greater than 0. Since `k` is already stated to be an input integer, we can assume it is valid. Therefore, the set `us` must contain at least one element.

The variable `i` is not explicitly initialized before the loop, but it will be set to the first element of `us` when the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must have at least 1 element, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing all characters from `s` that were added to `win` when `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters, `ps` is the number of times `win` was cleared (i.e., the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters), and `ps` is less than `n`, `i` is the first element of `us`**.
