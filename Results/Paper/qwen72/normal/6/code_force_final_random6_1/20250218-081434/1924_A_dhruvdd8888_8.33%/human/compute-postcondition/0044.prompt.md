Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing all characters from `s` that were added to `win` when `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters, and `ps` is the number of times `win` was cleared (i.e., the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters). Additionally, `ps` is less than `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in us:
    if i not in win:
        print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must have at least 1 element, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing all characters from `s` that were added to `win` when `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters, `ps` is the number of times `win` was cleared (i.e., the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters), and `ps` is less than `n`. If `i` is not in `win`, then `i` is the first element of `us` and is not in `win`. Otherwise, `i` is the first element of `us` and is in `win`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must have at least 1 element, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing all characters from `s` that were added to `win` when `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters, `ps` is the number of times `win` was cleared (i.e., the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters), and `ps` is less than `n`. If `i` is not in `win`, then `i` is the next element of `us` and is not in `win`. Otherwise, `i` is the next element of `us` and is in `win`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must have at least 1 element, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing all characters from `s` that were added to `win` when `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters, `ps` is the number of times `win` was cleared (i.e., the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters), and `ps` is less than `n`. If `i` is not in `win`, then `i` is the next element of `us` and is not in `win`. If `i` is in `win`, then `i` is the next element of `us` and is in `win`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
