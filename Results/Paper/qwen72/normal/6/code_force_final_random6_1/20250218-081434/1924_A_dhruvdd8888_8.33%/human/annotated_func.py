#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing all characters from `s` that were added to `win` when `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters, and `ps` is the number of times `win` was cleared (i.e., the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters).

        #The program prints 'YES' and returns None.

Additionally, `ps` is less than `n`.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing all characters from `s` that were added to `win` when `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters, `ps` is the number of times `win` was cleared (i.e., the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters), and `ps` is less than `n`. The loop has printed a string for each element `i` in `us` that was not in `win`, where the string is `ans` concatenated with `i` and then padded with `a` to make the total length `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two lines of input: the first line contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It processes the string `s` to find sequences of `k` unique characters and counts how many such sequences are found. If the count of these sequences is greater than or equal to `n`, the function prints 'YES' and returns `None`. If the count is less than `n`, the function prints 'NO' and then, for each character in the set of the first `k` alphabets that was not part of the last sequence, it prints a string composed of the characters that formed the sequences, followed by the missing character, and padded with 'a' to make the string length `n`. The function does not return any value.
