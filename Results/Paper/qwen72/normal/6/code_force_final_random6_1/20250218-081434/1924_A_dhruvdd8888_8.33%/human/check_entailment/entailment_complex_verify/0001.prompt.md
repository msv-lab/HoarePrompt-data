You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

The loop has printed a string for each element `i` in `us` that was not in `win`, where the string is `ans` concatenated with `i` and then padded with `a` to make the total length `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two lines of input: the first line contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It processes the string `s` to find sequences of `k` unique characters and counts how many such sequences are found. If the count of these sequences is greater than or equal to `n`, the function prints 'YES' and returns `None`. If the count is less than `n`, the function prints 'NO' and then, for each character in the set of the first `k` alphabets that was not part of the last sequence, it prints a string composed of the characters that formed the sequences, followed by the missing character, and padded with 'a' to make the string length `n`. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Function Call**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input.
   - It reads the string `s` of length `m`.
   - It initializes a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It initializes an empty set `win` to keep track of the characters in the current window.
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the characters that form a valid subsequence.
   - It initializes a counter `ps` to count the number of valid subsequences.

3. **Processing the String `s`**:
   - The program iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - If the character `i` is in the set `us`, it adds `i` to the set `win`.
   - If the set `win` contains all `k` characters, it appends `i` to the list `ans`, increments the counter `ps`, and clears the set `win`.

4. **Checking the Condition**:
   - After processing the string `s`, the program checks if the counter `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - If `ps >= n`, it prints 'YES' and returns.
   - If `ps < n`, it prints 'NO'.

5. **Generating a Missing Subsequence**:
   - The program then attempts to generate a missing subsequence of length `n` that does not occur in `s`.
   - It iterates over the set `us` and finds a character `i` that is not in the set `win`.
   - It prints the concatenation of the list `ans`, the character `i`, and `n - len(ans) - 1` occurrences of 'a'.

**Issues and Incorrectness**:
- **Incorrect Subsequence Check**:
  - The program does not correctly check if all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are present in `s`.
  - The logic of clearing `win` and appending `i` to `ans` is flawed. It does not ensure that all possible subsequences are checked.
  - The program only checks if there are `n` distinct characters in `s` that form a valid subsequence, which is not the same as checking all possible subsequences.

- **Generating a Missing Subsequence**:
  - The logic for generating a missing subsequence is also incorrect. It does not guarantee that the generated subsequence is one that does not occur in `s`.
  - The program should generate all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters and check if they are present in `s`.

**Correct Approach**:
- To correctly solve the problem, you need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- For each generated string, check if it is a subsequence of `s`.
- If any generated string is not a subsequence of `s`, print 'NO' and the missing subsequence.
- If all generated strings are subsequences, print 'YES'.

Given the issues in the logic and the incorrect approach to generating and checking subsequences, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
