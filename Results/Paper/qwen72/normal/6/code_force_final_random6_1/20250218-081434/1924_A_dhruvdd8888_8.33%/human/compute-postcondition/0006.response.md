To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which is `i` and `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is not empty. Given the initial state, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. For the loop to execute, `s` must have at least one character. Additionally, `i` will be the first character of `s` at the start of the first iteration.

Let's break it down:
- `s` must have at least one character, so `m` must be greater than 0.
- `i` will be the first character of `s` when the loop starts.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, `ps`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is an empty list, `ps` is 0, `i` is the first character of `s`**
