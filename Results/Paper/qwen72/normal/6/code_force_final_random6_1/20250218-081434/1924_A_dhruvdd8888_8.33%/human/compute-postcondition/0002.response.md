Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**

Explanation:
- The code creates a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- The set `us` is generated by converting the integers from 0 to `k-1` to their corresponding ASCII characters using `chr(i + 97)`.
- The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged, but `s` is now the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- The new variable `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
