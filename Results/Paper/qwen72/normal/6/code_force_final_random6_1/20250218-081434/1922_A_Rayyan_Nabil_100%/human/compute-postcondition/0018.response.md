Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` (one additional result appended), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the new stripped input string, `b` is the new stripped input string, `c` is the new stripped input string, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.**

Explanation:
- The code `c = input().strip()` assigns the new stripped input string to `c`.
- The values of `t`, `results`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The condition `t` must be greater than the new value of `_` still holds true.
