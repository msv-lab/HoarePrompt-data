Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not.
   - A string `s` matches the template `t` if for each index `i`:
     - If `t[i]` is lowercase, `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
     - If `t[i]` is uppercase, `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if there is any index `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If such an index is found, it returns 'YES'.
   - If no such index is found, it returns 'NO'.
   - This function is correct because:
     - If there is an index `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, we can construct a template `t` with `t[i]` being an uppercase version of `c[i]` (or any other uppercase letter that is not the lowercase version of `c[i]`). This ensures that `a` and `b` match the template, while `c` does not.
     - If no such index is found, it means for every index `i`, at least one of `a[i]` or `b[i]` is the same as `c[i]`. In this case, it is impossible to construct a template `t` that matches both `a` and `b` but not `c`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.
   - This function is also correct because:
     - It correctly reads the inputs and processes each test case independently.
     - It uses `func_1` to determine the result for each test case, which we have established is correct.

4. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it, while `c` does not.
   - The input and output handling is correct and follows the problem description.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
