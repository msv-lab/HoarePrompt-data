Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

# Functions with Execution Summary:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It checks if there is any index `i` (from 0 to `n-1`) where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such an index is found, the function returns 'YES'. If no such index is found, the function returns 'NO'.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three additional inputs: an integer `n`, and two strings `a` and `b`, and a third string `c`. It then calls `func_1` with these inputs and appends the result to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list. The final state of the program is that `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`, `results` is a list containing `t` results, and each result is the output of `func_1` for the corresponding test case.
