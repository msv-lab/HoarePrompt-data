Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The logic in `func_1` checks if for any index `i` (from 0 to `n-1`), both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such an index is found, the function returns 'YES'. If no such index is found, the function returns 'NO'.

However, this logic is incorrect because it only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` at the same index. This does not ensure that `a` and `b` match the template `t` as described in the problem statement. The correct approach should be to check if for each index `i`, there exists a template character that can satisfy the conditions for both `a` and `b` to match the template, while `c` does not.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should:
1. For each index `i`, determine if there is a lowercase letter that matches both `a[i]` and `b[i]` and an uppercase letter that, when converted to lowercase, does not match `c[i]`.
2. If such a template can be constructed for all indices, then `a` and `b` match the template, and `c` does not.

The current implementation in `func_1` does not perform this check. It only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, which is not sufficient to ensure that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
