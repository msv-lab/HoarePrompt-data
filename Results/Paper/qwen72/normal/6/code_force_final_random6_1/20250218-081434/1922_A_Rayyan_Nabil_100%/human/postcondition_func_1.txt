The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three additional inputs: an integer `n`, and two strings `a` and `b`, and a third string `c`. It then calls `func_1` with these inputs and appends the result to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list. The final state of the program is that `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`, `results` is a list containing `t` results, and each result is the output of `func_1` for the corresponding test case.
