Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is an empty list, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is an input integer.** 

The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input().strip())` to the variable `n`. This means `n` is now an integer based on the user input. The other variables `t`, `results`, and `_` remain unchanged from their initial state.
