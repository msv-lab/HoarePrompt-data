The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the context provided, it seems there might be an implicit understanding or an external context where the number of test cases, `t`, is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Since the function does not explicitly accept any parameters, we can only describe the output based on the information given.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It returns a result based on the number of test cases, `t`, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.**
