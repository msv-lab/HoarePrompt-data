Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` (one additional result appended), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the new stripped input string, `c` is the new stripped input string, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(input().strip())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer.
- The value of `n` is now the new input integer, but the previous values of other variables (`t`, `results`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `t` must be greater than the new value of `_` still holds.
- The precondition that `1 <= t <= 1000` still holds.
- The list `results` still contains the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` with one additional result appended.
- The variable `_` is still incremented by 1.
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are still the stripped input strings.
