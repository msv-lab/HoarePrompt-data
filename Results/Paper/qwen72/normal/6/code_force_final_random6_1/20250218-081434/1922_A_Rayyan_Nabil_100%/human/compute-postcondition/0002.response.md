The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Since `t` is given to be an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, this ensures that `t` is at least 1, which means the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The `results` list is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is an empty list, `_` is a placeholder variable**
