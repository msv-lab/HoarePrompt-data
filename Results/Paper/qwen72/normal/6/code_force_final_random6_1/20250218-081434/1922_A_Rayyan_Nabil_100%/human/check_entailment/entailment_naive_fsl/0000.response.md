Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if for each position `i`, the characters `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, it does not ensure that `a` and `b` match the same template, which is a requirement of the problem.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
In this case, the function `func_1` will return 'YES' because for each position `i`, `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` are all different. However, there is no template `t` that can match both `a` and `b` while not matching `c`. For `a` and `b` to match the same template, they must have the same characters in the positions where the template has lowercase letters, and different characters in the positions where the template has uppercase letters. This is not checked by the provided program.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
