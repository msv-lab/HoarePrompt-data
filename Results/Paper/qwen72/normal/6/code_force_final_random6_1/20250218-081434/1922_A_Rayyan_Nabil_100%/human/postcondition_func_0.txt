The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It checks if there is any index `i` (from 0 to `n-1`) where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such an index is found, the function returns 'YES'. If no such index is found, the function returns 'NO'.
