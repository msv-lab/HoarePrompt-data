The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `_` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` was incremented by 1, and `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` (one additional result appended), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the new stripped input string, `c` is the new stripped input string.** 

However, to be more precise and align with the task requirements:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` (one additional result appended), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the new stripped input string, `c` is the new stripped input string, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`**.
