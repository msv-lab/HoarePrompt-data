You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing `t` results, each result being the output of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration, `_` is a placeholder variable that has been incremented `t` times, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last stripped input string, `b` is the last stripped input string, `c` is the last stripped input string.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing `t` results, each result being the output of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration, `result` is the last element of `results`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters. It returns a result based on the number of test cases, `t`, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.

```

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
