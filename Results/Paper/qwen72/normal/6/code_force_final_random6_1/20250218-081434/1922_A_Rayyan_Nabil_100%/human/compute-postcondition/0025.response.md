The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If there are more elements in `results`, the loop will continue to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `result` was the second element of `results`, and `results` is a list containing `t` results.

For the loop to execute one more time, `result` must be the third element of `results`, and `results` must have at least 3 elements (since `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `results` contains `t` results).

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing `t` results, each result being the output of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration, `result` is the third element of `results`**
