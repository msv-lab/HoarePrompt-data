The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition but is expected to process a set of inputs described as follows: `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases, with each test case containing an integer `n` that represents the number of signs, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` represents the periodicity of each sign. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each.

Given the nature of the inputs and the typical structure of such functions, the output is likely a list of results corresponding to each test case. However, without explicit return statements in the provided code snippet, the exact form of the output cannot be determined from the given information alone.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers representing the periodicity of signs. It returns a result for each test case.**
