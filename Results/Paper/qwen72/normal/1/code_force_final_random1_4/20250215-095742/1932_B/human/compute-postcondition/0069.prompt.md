Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of t elements, where each element is a list containing two sublists: the first sublist contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of signs, and the second sublist contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), representing the periodicities of the signs. results is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for test in test_cases:
    n, a = test
    current_year = 0
    for ai in a:
        if current_year % ai == 0:
            next_year = current_year + ai
        else:
            next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
        current_year = next_year
    results.append(current_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 1, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year`, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is a non-empty list with at least as many elements as the length of `a`, `current_year` is now the final value of `next_year` after all iterations, `ai` is the last element of the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` appended to it, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and has `n` elements, `current_year` is the final value after processing all elements in `a`, `ai` is the last element of the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `current_year` is the final value obtained after processing all elements in the list `a` according to the loop logic. The variable `results` now contains the final value of `current_year` appended to it. The variables `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. The variable `ai` will be the last element of the list `a` processed by the loop. The variable `test` will be the next element in `test_cases` after the current test case has been fully processed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
