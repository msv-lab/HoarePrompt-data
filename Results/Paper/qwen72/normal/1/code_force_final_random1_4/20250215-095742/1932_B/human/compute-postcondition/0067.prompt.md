Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` appended to it, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and has `n` elements, `current_year` is now 0, `ai` is the last element of the list `a`, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`.
Code of the loop:
for ai in a:
    if current_year % ai == 0:
        next_year = current_year + ai
    else:
        next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
    current_year = next_year


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` appended to it, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test` and must be at least 1, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and has `n` elements, `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`, `ai` is the first element of the list `a`, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`. If `current_year` was divisible by `ai`, `next_year` remains `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the previous `current_year`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` appended to it, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test` and must be at least 1, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and has `n` elements, `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`, `ai` is the second element of the list `a`, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`. If the previous `current_year` was divisible by `ai`, `next_year` remains `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the previous `current_year`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` appended to it, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test` and must be at least 1, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and has `n` elements, `ai` is the third element of the list `a`, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`. If `current_year % ai == 0`, then `next_year` was previously equal to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `current_year` was previously equal to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
