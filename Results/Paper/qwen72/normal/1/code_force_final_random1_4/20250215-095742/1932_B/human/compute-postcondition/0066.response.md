Output State: **`current_year` is now equal to `next_year`, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` appended to it, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test` and must be at least 1, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and has `n` elements, `ai` is the third element of the list `a`, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`. If `current_year % ai == 0`, then `next_year` was previously equal to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `current_year` was previously equal to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.**
