Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year`, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and has `n` elements, `current_year` is the final value after processing all elements in `a`, `ai` is the last element of the list `a`. For each element `ai` in `a`, if `current_year % ai == 0`, then `next_year` was `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` was `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`. The final `current_year` is the result of applying these rules to all elements in `a`.**
