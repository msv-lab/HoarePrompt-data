Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` appended to it, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test` and must be at least 1, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and has `n` elements, `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`, `ai` is the second element of the list `a`, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`. If the previous `current_year` was divisible by `ai`, `next_year` remains `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the previous `current_year`.**

Explanation:
- The code `current_year = next_year` updates the value of `current_year` to be equal to the value of `next_year`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `a`, `ai`, `test`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for `next_year` (whether it remains `ai` or becomes the smallest multiple of `ai` greater than the previous `current_year`) is still valid and applies to the new value of `current_year`.
