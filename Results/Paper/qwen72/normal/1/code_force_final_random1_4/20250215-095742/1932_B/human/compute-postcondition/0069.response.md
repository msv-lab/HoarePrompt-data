Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements, each element being a list with two sublists: the first sublist contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and the second sublist contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The variable `results` is a list containing t elements, where each element is the final value of `current_year` after processing the corresponding test case. The variables `n`, `a`, `current_year`, and `ai` are no longer relevant after the loop completes.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the number of test cases `t` and the list `test_cases` remain unchanged. The `results` list now contains the final value of `current_year` for each test case, which represents the smallest year when all signs in that test case align according to their periodicities. The variables `n`, `a`, `current_year`, and `ai` are no longer relevant because they were used within the loop and do not retain any specific values outside of it.
