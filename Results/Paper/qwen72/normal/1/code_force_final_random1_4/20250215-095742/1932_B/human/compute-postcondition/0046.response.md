The only objects in the loop head are the variable `test` and the list `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has more elements, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where `t` must be at least 2, meaning there is at least one more element in `test_cases` for the loop to execute again. The variable `test` holds the current element being processed, which is a tuple consisting of `n` and `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, and `test` will be updated to the next element in `test_cases`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` appended to it, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and has `n` elements, `current_year` is the final value after processing all elements in `a`, `ai` is the last element of the list `a`, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`**
