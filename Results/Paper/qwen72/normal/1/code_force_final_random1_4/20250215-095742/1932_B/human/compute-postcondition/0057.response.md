Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` appended to it, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test` and must be at least 1, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and has `n` elements, `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`, `ai` is the second element of the list `a`, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `next_year` is now `current_year + ai`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `next_year` to be `current_year + ai`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- `current_year` is still equal to `next_year` from the initial state, but `next_year` is updated to `current_year + ai`.
- The rest of the initial state remains valid.
