Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of signs. `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the periodicity of each sign. `t` is now set to the value of the user input, which is an integer within the range 1 to 1000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    year = 0
    for ai in a:
        year += year % ai or ai
    print(year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `a` is a list of integers input by the user with `n` elements, `year` is the sum of `(year % ai or ai)` for each `ai` in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `a` is a list of integers input by the user with exactly `n` elements, `year` is the sum of `(year % ai or ai)` for each `ai` in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `a` is a list of integers with exactly `n` elements, `year` is the sum of the elements in the list `a` where each element `ai` contributes either `ai` or `year % ai` if `year % ai` is non-zero.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
