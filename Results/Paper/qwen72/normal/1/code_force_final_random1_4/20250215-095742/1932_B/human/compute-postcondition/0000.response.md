Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of signs. `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the periodicity of each sign. `t` is now set to the value of the user input, which is an integer within the range 1 to 1000.**
