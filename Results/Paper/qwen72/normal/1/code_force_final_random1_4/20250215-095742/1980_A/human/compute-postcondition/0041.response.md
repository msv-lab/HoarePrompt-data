Output State: **The program returns a list named `results` containing `t` elements, where each element represents the value of `missing` for the corresponding test case. Each `missing` value is the sum of `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, and `freq` is a list of 7 integers representing the frequency of characters 'A' to 'G' in the string `a` from the respective tuple in `test_cases`.**
