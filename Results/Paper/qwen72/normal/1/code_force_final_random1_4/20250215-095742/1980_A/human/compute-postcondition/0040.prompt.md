Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m, a = test_cases[_]
    freq = [0] * 7
    for prob in a:
        freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
    missing = sum(max(0, m - f) for f in freq)
    results.append(missing)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `missing`, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and has been fully iterated over, `freq` is a list of 7 integers representing the frequency of characters 'A' to 'G' in `a`, `missing` is the sum of max(0, m - f) for each f in freq.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the original element and the value of `missing`, `n` is the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases` and has been fully processed, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by the count of corresponding characters in `a`, `missing` is the sum of max(0, m - f) for each f in freq, `_` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the original elements and now includes the value of `missing`, `n` is the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable, `freq` is a list where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by the count of each corresponding character in `a`, `missing` is the sum of max(0, m - f) for each f in `freq`, `_` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
