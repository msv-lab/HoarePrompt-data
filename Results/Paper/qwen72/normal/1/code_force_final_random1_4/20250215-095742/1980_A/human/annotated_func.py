#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is a tuple (n, m) with n being a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and m being a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 5), representing the number of problems in the bank and the number of upcoming rounds, respectively; the second element is a string a of length n, consisting of uppercase letters 'A' to 'G', representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create.

    Args:
        t (int): Number of test cases.
        test_cases (list): List of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing
            - n (int): Number of problems in the bank.
            - m (int): Number of upcoming rounds.
            - a (str): String of problem difficulties.

    Returns:
        list: List of results, one for each test case.

    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, a = test_cases[_]
        
        freq = [0] * 7

    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is still a list of tuples, and `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each representing the value of `missing` for the corresponding test case. Each `missing` value is calculated as the sum of `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, where `freq` is a list of 7 integers representing the frequency of characters 'A' to 'G' in the string `a` from the respective tuple in `test_cases`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `a` are no longer relevant outside the loop, as they are re-assigned in each iteration.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named `results` containing `t` elements, where each element represents the value of `missing` for the corresponding test case. Each `missing` value is the sum of `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, and `freq` is a list of 7 integers representing the frequency of characters 'A' to 'G' in the string `a` from the respective tuple in `test_cases`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases` as input. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains a tuple `(n, m)` and a string `a`, where `n` is the number of problems in the bank, `m` is the number of upcoming rounds, and `a` is a string representing the difficulties of the problems. The function calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case to ensure that there are at least `m` problems of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). It returns a list of these minimum numbers for all `t` test cases. The original `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
