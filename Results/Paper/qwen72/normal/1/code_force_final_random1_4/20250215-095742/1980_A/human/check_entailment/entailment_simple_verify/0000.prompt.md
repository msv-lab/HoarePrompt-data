You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

Each `missing` value is calculated as the sum of `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, where `freq` is a list of 7 integers representing the frequency of characters 'A' to 'G' in the string `a` from the respective tuple in `test_cases`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `a` are no longer relevant outside the loop, as they are re-assigned in each iteration.

    #The program returns a list named `results` containing `t` elements, where each element represents the value of `missing` for the corresponding test case. Each `missing` value is the sum of `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, and `freq` is a list of 7 integers representing the frequency of characters 'A' to 'G' in the string `a` from the respective tuple in `test_cases`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to hold `m` rounds. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Frequency Calculation**: The program initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (one for each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'). It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `freq` for each character in the string. This correctly counts the number of problems available for each difficulty level.

2. **Missing Problems Calculation**: The program calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by using the formula `max(0, m - f)` for each frequency `f`. This ensures that if there are already enough problems for a particular difficulty level, no additional problems are needed. The sum of these values gives the total number of missing problems required to hold `m` rounds.

3. **Test Case Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the `test_cases` list and applying the above logic to each test case. The results are stored in a list and returned.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when there are no problems available for a particular difficulty level or when there are more than enough problems for a particular difficulty level.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
