Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `missing`, `n` is the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases` and has been fully processed, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by the count of corresponding characters in `a`, `missing` is the sum of max(0, m - f) for each f in freq, `_` is incremented by 1.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- The list `test_cases` remains unchanged.
- The list `results` still contains one element, which is the value of `missing`.
- The variables `n` and `m` are still the first and second elements of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, respectively.
- The list `a` has been fully processed, meaning all characters in `a` have been used to update the `freq` list.
- The `freq` list now contains the counts of each character (from 'A' to 'G') in the list `a`.
- The variable `missing` is updated to be the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and each element in `freq`.
- The index `_` is incremented by 1, indicating that the next test case will be processed in the next iteration of the outer loop.
