Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the original element and the value of `missing`, `n` is the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')]` is incremented by 1, `missing` is the sum of max(0, m - f) for each f in `freq`, `_` is incremented by 1, `prob` is the next element in `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')]` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `missing`, `_`) remain unchanged in their roles and values, except for the specific update to `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')]`.
- The variable `prob` is set to the next element in the iterable `a`.
- The index `_` is incremented by 1, indicating the next iteration in the sequence of operations.
