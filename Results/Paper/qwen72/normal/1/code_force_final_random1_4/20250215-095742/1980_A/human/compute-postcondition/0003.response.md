The code snippet assigns the first tuple from the `test_cases` list to the variables `n`, `m`, and `a`. Since `_` is a placeholder, it is assumed to be 0, meaning the first tuple in the list is used.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`.**
