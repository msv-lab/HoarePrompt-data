Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the original element and the value of `missing`, `n` is the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable, `freq` is a list where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by the count of each corresponding character in `a`, `missing` is the sum of max(0, m - f) for each f in `freq`, `_` is incremented by 1.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- **`test_cases`**: The list of tuples remains unchanged.
- **`results`**: The list containing the original element and the value of `missing` remains unchanged.
- **`n`**: The first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases` remains unchanged.
- **`m`**: The second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases` remains unchanged.
- **`a`**: The third element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases` is a non-empty iterable. After the loop, the frequency of each character in `a` is counted and stored in `freq`.
- **`freq`**: This list now contains the count of each character in `a` (where the index corresponds to the character's position in the alphabet minus 'A').
- **`missing`**: This value is updated to be the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and each frequency in `freq`.
- **`_`**: This index is incremented by 1, indicating that the next test case will be processed in the next iteration of the outer loop.
