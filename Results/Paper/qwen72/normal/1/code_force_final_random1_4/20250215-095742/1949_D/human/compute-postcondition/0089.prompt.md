Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `xx` is a list containing an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    x = input()
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if x[j - 1] == 'F':
            a[i] += 1
            a[j] += 1
        elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
            b[i] += 1
            b[j] += 1
    xx.append(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 2 if the corresponding character in `x` at index `j - 1` is 'F', otherwise it remains unchanged. `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 2 if the corresponding character in `x` at index `j - 1` is 'S', otherwise it remains unchanged. `xx` is a list containing one string, which is the user input string `x`. `x` is a user input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 'F' at index `j - 1` in the string `x`, and `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 'S' at index `j - 1` in the string `x`. The element at index 2 of `a` is incremented by the total number of 'F' characters in `x`, and the element at index 2 of `b` is incremented by the total number of 'S' characters in `x`. The list `xx` now contains two strings, the original user input string `x` and the same user input string `x` appended again. The variable `j` is `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `xx` now contains three strings: the original user input string `x`, the same user input string `x` appended again, and the new user input string `x`. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `j`) remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
