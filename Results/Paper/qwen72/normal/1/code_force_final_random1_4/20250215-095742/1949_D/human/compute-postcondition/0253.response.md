The code snippet `nx += 'S'` attempts to concatenate the string `'S'` to the variable `nx`. However, the initial state does not specify what `nx` is, and since `n` is an integer, `nx` is likely intended to be a string. Without knowing the initial value of `nx`, we can only say that `'S'` is appended to whatever `nx` was before.

Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the string 'S'**.
