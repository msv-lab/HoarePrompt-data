Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, and the matrix properties remain unchanged.** 

The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, and the input consists of `n` lines, each containing `n` characters. After executing the code `n = int(input())`, the value of `n` is updated to the integer input by the user, which must still satisfy the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The properties of the matrix, including its symmetry and the presence of '.' on the diagonal, remain unchanged. The constraint on the number of decided transitions also remains valid.
