Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input, including the integer `n` and the `n x n` matrix representing the transition videos. It initializes arrays `a` and `b` to count the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each scenario, respectively.

2. **Symmetry Check**: The program ensures that the matrix is symmetric by reading the input and storing it in `xx`. This is important because the transition videos are bidirectional, meaning the transition from scenario `i` to `j` should be the same as from `j` to `i`.

3. **Counting Transitions**: The program counts the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each scenario and stores these counts in `a` and `b`. This helps in identifying scenarios that have already been assigned a specific type of transition.

4. **Identifying Undecided Scenarios**: The program identifies scenarios that have only 'F' or only 'S' transitions and categorizes them into `sa` and `sb` lists, respectively. This helps in deciding the type of transition for the remaining undecided scenarios.

5. **Assigning Undecided Transitions**: The program assigns 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions based on the balance between 'F' and 'S' transitions. If there are more scenarios with 'F' transitions, it tries to balance by assigning more 'S' transitions, and vice versa. This is done to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type occur in any permutation of scenarios.

6. **Output**: The program prints the updated matrix, ensuring that the symmetry is maintained and the constraints are satisfied.

Given the problem requirements and the execution summary, the program appears to handle the input correctly, process the transitions appropriately, and produce a valid output that meets the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
