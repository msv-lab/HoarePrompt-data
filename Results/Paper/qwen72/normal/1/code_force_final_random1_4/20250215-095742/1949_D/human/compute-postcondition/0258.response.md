Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3, `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][2]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, and `j` is 3.
- The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by adding the value at `xx[i][j - 1]`.
- Since `j` is 3, `j - 1` is 2, so the code effectively updates `nx` to `nx + xx[i][2]`.
- The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.
- The output state reflects the updated value of `nx` and retains the unchanged values of `n` and `j`.
