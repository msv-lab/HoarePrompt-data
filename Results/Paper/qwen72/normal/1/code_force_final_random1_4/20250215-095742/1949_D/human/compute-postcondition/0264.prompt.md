Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the total number of 'F' and 'S' characters at each index across all input strings, respectively. `xx` is a list containing `n` user input strings. `sa` and `sb` are lists containing indices where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, and `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, respectively, with the length of `sa` being less than the length of `sb`. For each index `j` from 1 to `n`, if `a[j]` and `b[j]` are both 0, then `sb` contains the value `j`. The variable `nx` is now an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sb[:n // 4] or j in sb[:n // 4]:
        nx += 'S'
    else:
        nx += 'F'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1. If `xx[i][0]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][0]`. If `xx[i][0]` is '?', and either `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, `nx` is updated to include the character 'S' appended to its previous value. Otherwise, `nx` is updated to the original value of `nx` plus the character 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2. If `xx[i][1]` is not '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][1]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the string 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is set to 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3. If `xx[i][2]` is not '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][2]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'F'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
