Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by the total number of 'F' characters at index `j - 1` across all input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by the total number of 'S' characters at index `j - 1` across all input strings, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, each of which is a user input string. If `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `sa` is a list containing [1] and `sb` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged as empty lists.***
