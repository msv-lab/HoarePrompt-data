Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, plus any indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where both `a[j]` and `b[j]` are 0, `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `j` is `n + 1`. The string `nx` contains the characters from `xx[1]` where the corresponding character is not a question mark (`?`). For positions in `xx[1]` that are question marks (`?`), `nx` contains 'F' if the current index `j` or the index `i` is in the first quarter of `sa`, otherwise it contains 'S'.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n`.
- For each iteration, if the character at position `j - 1` in `xx[1]` is not a question mark (`?`), it is directly appended to `nx`.
- If the character at position `j - 1` in `xx[1]` is a question mark (`?`), the loop checks if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`. If so, 'F' is appended to `nx`; otherwise, 'S' is appended.
- After the loop completes, `j` will be `n + 1`, and `nx` will contain the final constructed string based on the rules described above.
