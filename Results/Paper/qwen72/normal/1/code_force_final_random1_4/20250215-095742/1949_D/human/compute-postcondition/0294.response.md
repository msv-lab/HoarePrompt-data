The function `func` does not explicitly list any parameters in its definition, but based on the problem description, it implicitly works with an input matrix represented by `n` lines, each containing `n` characters. These characters can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (diagonal, no transition). The matrix is symmetric, and the diagonal is filled with '.', indicating no transition. Additionally, at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) transition videos are already decided, meaning at most \(2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'. 

Given these constraints, the function processes this matrix and returns a result based on the input. However, the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes a symmetric matrix of size n x n, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The matrix contains characters 'F', 'S', '?', and '.', representing funny, scary, undecided, and no transition states, respectively. The function returns a result based on the input matrix, considering the constraints that the matrix is symmetric, the diagonal is filled with '.', and at most \(2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) characters are 'F' or 'S'.**
