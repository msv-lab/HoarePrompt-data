Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, plus any indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where both `a[j]` and `b[j]` are 0, `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `nx` is an empty string, `j` is 1, the character at position `j - 1` in the string `xx[i]` is `?`, and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `i` and `j` are not in `sa[:n // 4]`).***
