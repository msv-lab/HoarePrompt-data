To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic used to construct the string `nx`.

### Initial State:
- `j` will be `n + 1` after all iterations of the loop.
- `i` will remain `n + 1`.
- `nx` will be a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the conditions specified in the loop.
- For each index `j` from 1 to `n`:
  - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not a question mark ('?'), the corresponding character from `xx[i][j - 1]` is appended to `nx`.
  - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is a question mark ('?') and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, 'S' is appended to `nx`.
  - Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n`.
   - For each `j`, the character to be appended to `nx` is determined based on the conditions.

2. **Character Determination**:
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not a question mark, it is directly appended to `nx`.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is a question mark:
     - Check if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`.
     - If true, append 'S' to `nx`.
     - Otherwise, append 'F' to `nx`.

3. **Final String Construction**:
   - The string `nx` will be constructed based on the above rules for each `j` from 1 to `n`.

### Example:
Let's assume the following values for the variables:
- `n = 8`
- `i = 8`
- `xx = [['A', '?', 'C', '?', 'E', '?', 'G', '?'], ['H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O']]`
- `sb = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`

### Constructing `nx`:
- For `j = 1`:
  - `xx[8][0]` is 'A' (not '?'), so `nx` becomes 'A'.
- For `j = 2`:
  - `xx[8][1]` is '?', and `j = 2` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb` (since `n // 4 = 2`), so `nx` becomes 'AS'.
- For `j = 3`:
  - `xx[8][2]` is 'C' (not '?'), so `nx` becomes 'ASC'.
- For `j = 4`:
  - `xx[8][3]` is '?', and `j = 4` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, so `nx` becomes 'ASCF'.
- For `j = 5`:
  - `xx[8][4]` is 'E' (not '?'), so `nx` becomes 'ASCFE'.
- For `j = 6`:
  - `xx[8][5]` is '?', and `j = 6` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, so `nx` becomes 'ASCFEF'.
- For `j = 7`:
  - `xx[8][6]` is 'G' (not '?'), so `nx` becomes 'ASCFEFG'.
- For `j = 8`:
  - `xx[8][7]` is '?', and `j = 8` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, so `nx` becomes 'ASCFEFGF'.

### Final Output:
The string `nx` will be 'ASCFEFGF'.

Output: **ASCFEFGF** (where `nx` is constructed based on the given conditions and the example values of `xx` and `sb`).
