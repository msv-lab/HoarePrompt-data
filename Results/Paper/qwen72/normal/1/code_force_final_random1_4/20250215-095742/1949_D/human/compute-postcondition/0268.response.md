To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, but given the initial state where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, this condition is already satisfied. However, `j` is currently set to `n + 1`, which means it is outside the range specified in the loop head (1 to n + 1). To ensure the loop can execute, `j` should be reset to 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `nx` is an empty string**
