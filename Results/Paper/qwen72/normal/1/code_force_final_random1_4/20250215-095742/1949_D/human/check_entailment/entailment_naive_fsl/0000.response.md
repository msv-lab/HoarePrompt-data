Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not ensure that no permutation of scenarios results in more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type. Specifically, the logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions (`?`) is flawed. The program attempts to balance the assignment of 'F' and 'S' by considering the counts of already determined funny and scary videos for each scenario. However, this approach does not guarantee that the constraint on consecutive videos is met for all permutations.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
5
.?F??
?.???
F?.S?
??S.?
????.
```
The program might output:
```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.SF
FSSF.
FFFF.
```
However, if the player follows the permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the sequence of transition videos would be `F, F, S, S`. This sequence has 2 consecutive 'F' videos and 2 consecutive 'S' videos, which is within the limit of \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 5}{4} \rceil = 4\). However, if the player follows the permutation `[1, 3, 2, 4, 5]`, the sequence of transition videos would be `F, S, F, S`, which also meets the constraint. 

The issue arises when considering larger values of \(n\). For example, with \(n = 12\), the program's logic for balancing 'F' and 'S' might not prevent sequences like `SSSSSSSSSSS` (11 consecutive 'S' videos), which exceeds the limit of \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 12}{4} \rceil = 9\).

Thus, the program does not ensure the constraint is met for all permutations, making it incorrect.
