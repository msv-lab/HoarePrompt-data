Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2, and `i` is `n + 1`. If `xx[n + 1][1]` is not '?', `nx` is `initial_nx + xx[n + 1][1]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, an error occurs due to `nx` being undefined. Otherwise, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus `'F'`.***
