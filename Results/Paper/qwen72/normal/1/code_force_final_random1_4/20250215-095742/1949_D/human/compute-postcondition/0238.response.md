To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the total number of 'F' and 'S' characters at each index across all input strings, respectively.
   - `xx` is a list containing `n` user input strings.
   - `sa` and `sb` are lists containing indices where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, and `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, respectively, with the length of `sa` being less than the length of `sb`.
   - For each index `j` from 1 to `n`, if `a[j]` and `b[j]` are both 0, then `sb` contains the value `j`.
   - `nx` is a string that has been built by iterating through the string `xx[1]` and appending each character to `nx` unless it is a '?'. If a '?' is encountered, 'S' is appended if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`; otherwise, 'F' is appended.

2. **Building the String `nx`:**
   - We start with the string `xx[1]` (the second string in the list `xx`).
   - We iterate through each character in `xx[1]`.
   - If the character is not a '?', it is appended to `nx`.
   - If the character is a '?', we check if `i` (which is 1) is in the first quarter of `sb` or if the current index `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.
     - If either condition is true, 'S' is appended to `nx`.
     - Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.

3. **Determining the First Quarter of `sb`:**
   - The first quarter of `sb` consists of the first `len(sb) // 4` elements of `sb`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The final string `nx` will be constructed based on the rules described above.

Given the initial state and the construction rules, the output will depend on the specific values of `xx[1]` and `sb`. However, without the exact values of `xx[1]` and `sb`, we can describe the output in a general form.

Output: **nx (where nx is the string constructed by iterating through xx[1] and replacing '?' with 'S' if i is in the first quarter of sb or j is in the first quarter of sb, otherwise replacing '?' with 'F')**
