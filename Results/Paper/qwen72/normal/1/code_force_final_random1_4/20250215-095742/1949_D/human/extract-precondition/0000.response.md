Precondition: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. Each character is either 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (diagonal, no transition). The matrix is symmetric, and the diagonal is filled with '.', indicating no transition. At most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided, meaning at most 2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'.**
