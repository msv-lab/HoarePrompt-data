Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by categorizing scenarios into those that already have funny transitions (`sa`) and those that already have scary transitions (`sb`). However, the logic used to fill in the undecided transitions (`?`) does not guarantee that the requirement of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type will be met for all permutations of scenarios. Specifically, the program's approach to assigning `F` or `S` to the undecided transitions based on the initial categorization of scenarios might not prevent long sequences of the same type of transition video.

Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Categorization and Assignment**:
   - The program categorizes scenarios into `sa` (funny) and `sb` (scary) based on whether they have any funny or scary transitions already defined. This categorization does not consider the overall balance of transitions across all scenarios.
   - The assignment of `F` or `S` to undecided transitions is done based on the initial categorization, which might not ensure the required constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

2. **Handling of Undecided Transitions**:
   - The program assigns `F` to transitions involving scenarios in `sa[:n // 4]` and `S` to transitions involving scenarios in `sb[:n // 4]`. This approach does not necessarily balance the transitions effectively and might lead to long sequences of the same type of video.

3. **Lack of Global Balance**:
   - The program does not maintain a global balance of funny and scary transitions across all permutations of scenarios. It only considers the initial categorization and a simple assignment rule, which is insufficient to meet the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a backtracking algorithm to ensure that no permutation of scenarios results in more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type. The current program does not provide such a guarantee, making it incorrect for the given problem.
