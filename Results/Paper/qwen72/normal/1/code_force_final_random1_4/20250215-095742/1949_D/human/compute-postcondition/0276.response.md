Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1, `i` is `n + 1`, and the character at position `i` in `xx` and index `j - 1` is `?`. If `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.***
