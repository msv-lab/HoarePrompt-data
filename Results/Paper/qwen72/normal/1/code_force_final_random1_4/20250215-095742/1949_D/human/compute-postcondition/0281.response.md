The code snippet `nx += 'F'` attempts to concatenate the string `'F'` to the variable `nx`. However, there is no initial value given for `nx` in the initial state. Assuming `nx` is a string (since string concatenation is being performed), and since its initial value is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value before the operation. However, we know that after the operation, `nx` will be the original value of `nx` plus the string `'F'`.

The values of `n`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2, `i` is `n + 1`, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus `'F'`.**
