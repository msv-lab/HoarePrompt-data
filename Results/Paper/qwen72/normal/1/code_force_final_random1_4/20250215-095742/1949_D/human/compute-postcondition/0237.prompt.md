Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by the total number of 'F' characters at index `j - 1` across all input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by the total number of 'S' characters at index `j - 1` across all input strings, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, each of which is a user input string, `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, and the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. For each index `j` from 1 to `n`, if `a[j]` and `b[j]` are both 0, then `sb` now contains the value `j`. `nx` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sb[:n // 4] or j in sb[:n // 4]:
        nx += 'S'
    else:
        nx += 'F'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by the total number of 'F' characters at index `j - 1` across all input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by the total number of 'S' characters at index `j - 1` across all input strings, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, each of which is a user input string, `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, and the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. For each index `j` from 1 to `n`, if `a[j]` and `b[j]` are both 0, then `sb` now contains the value `j`. If the character at position `j - 1` in the string `xx[i]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is a string containing this character. If the character at position `j - 1` in the string `xx[i]` is '?', `nx` is 'S' if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`; otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by the total number of 'F' characters at index `j - 1` across all input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by the total number of 'S' characters at index `j - 1` across all input strings, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, each of which is a user input string, `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, and the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. For each index `j` from 1 to `n`, if `a[j]` and `b[j]` are both 0, then `sb` now contains the value `j`. If the character at position `j - 1` in the string `xx[i]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is the concatenation of its previous value and the character at position 1 (index 1) in the string `xx[1]`. If the character at position `j - 1` in the string `xx[i]` is '?', `nx` is a string containing the character at position `j - 1` in the string `xx[i]` followed by either 'S' if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, or 'F' otherwise. `j` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by the total number of 'F' characters at index `j - 1` across all input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by the total number of 'S' characters at index `j - 1` across all input strings, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, each of which is a user input string, `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, and the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. For each index `j` from 1 to `n`, if `a[j]` and `b[j]` are both 0, then `sb` now contains the value `j`. `j` is 3. If the character at position 2 (index 2) in the string `xx[1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is the concatenation of its previous value and the character at position 2 in the string `xx[1]`. If the character at position 2 in the string `xx[1]` is '?', `nx` is the concatenation of its previous value and either 'S' if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, or 'F' otherwise.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
