The code snippet `nx = ''` reassigns the variable `nx` to an empty string. This overrides the previous value of `nx`, which was a string containing characters based on certain rules. The other variables (`n`, `j`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is `n + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `nx` is an empty string.**
