n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters, where each character is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The character at the j-th position of the i-th line represents the transition video between the i-th and j-th scenarios. The character is 'F' if the video is funny, 'S' if the video is scary, '?' if the video is undecided, and '.' if i == j. The input guarantees that the i-th character of the j-th line and the j-th character of the i-th line are the same for all i and j, and that at most 2 * floor(n / 2) characters are 'F' or 'S'.
