You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    if a < b:
        (c, d) = func_1(b, a)
        return (d, c)
    if a % b == 0:
        return (1, -(a // b - 1))
    (c, d) = func_1(b, a % b)
    return (d, c - a // b * d)

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    (c, d) = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes two parameters, `a` (an integer) and `b` (a non-negative integer). It computes the result of `(c * a) % 1000000007`, where `c` is the first element returned by the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)`. The function returns this computed value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to count the number of permutations of length `n` that match the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums. The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function appears to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds the coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = \gcd(a, b)\). However, it is used here to find the modular inverse of `b` under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **func_2(a, b)**: This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `b` and then multiplies it by `a`, returning the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Essentially, it computes \(a \times b^{-1} \mod 10^9 + 7\).

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented for finding the modular inverse and performing modular multiplication.
   - However, the problem statement does not require these specific operations directly. The problem is about counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums, which involves combinatorial logic rather than modular arithmetic directly.

4. **Missing Combinatorial Logic**:
   - The provided functions do not address the core combinatorial problem of counting permutations with given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The solution should involve dynamic programming or combinatorial counting techniques to determine the number of valid permutations.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions are not sufficient to solve the problem as stated. They do not implement the necessary combinatorial logic to count the permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
