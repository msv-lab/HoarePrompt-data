Output State: **a is an integer, b is a non-negative integer, c and d are the results of `func_1(b, 1000000007)`**.

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `a` is an integer and `b` is a non-negative integer, which remain unchanged.
- The code snippet assigns the results of the function call `func_1(b, 1000000007)` to the variables `c` and `d`.
- Since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we know that `c` and `d` now hold the values returned by `func_1` when called with `b` and `1000000007` as arguments.
