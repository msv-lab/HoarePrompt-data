Correctness: **False**

The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly address the problem of counting the number of permutations based on the indices of prefix and suffix maximums. The functions seem to be related to modular arithmetic and the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which might be used in some part of the solution, but they are not sufficient or directly relevant to solving the given problem as described.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to implement logic that considers the constraints and properties of prefix and suffix maximums to count the number of valid permutations. This typically involves dynamic programming or combinatorial methods, which are not reflected in the provided functions.
