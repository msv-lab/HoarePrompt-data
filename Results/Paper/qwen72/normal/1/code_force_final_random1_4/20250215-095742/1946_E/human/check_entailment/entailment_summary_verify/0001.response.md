Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to count the number of permutations of length `n` that match the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums. The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = \gcd(a, b)\). In this context, it is used to find the modular inverse of `b` under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **func_2(a, b)**: This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `b` and then multiplies it by `a`, returning the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Essentially, it computes \(a \times b^{-1} \mod 10^9 + 7\).

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented for finding the modular inverse and performing modular multiplication.
   - However, the problem statement requires counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums, which involves combinatorial logic rather than direct modular arithmetic.

4. **Missing Combinatorial Logic**:
   - The provided functions do not address the core combinatorial problem of counting permutations with given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The solution should involve dynamic programming or combinatorial counting techniques to determine the number of valid permutations.
   - Specifically, the problem involves ensuring that the elements at the given prefix and suffix maximum indices are indeed the maximums in their respective segments, and then counting the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions are not sufficient to solve the problem as stated. They do not implement the necessary combinatorial logic to count the permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The provided functions are not sufficient to solve the problem, and additional combinatorial logic is required.

Final: **False**
