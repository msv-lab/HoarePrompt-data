### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in stating that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly address the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function appears to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. Specifically, it returns a tuple `(x, y)` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`.
   - While the Extended Euclidean Algorithm is a powerful tool in number theory, it is not directly applicable to the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute a modular inverse. Specifically, it computes `(c * a) % 1000000007`, where `c` is the first element returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`.
   - The modular inverse is useful in modular arithmetic, particularly when dealing with division in modular arithmetic. However, it is not directly relevant to the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.

3. **Relevance to the Problem**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums. This involves combinatorial counting and possibly dynamic programming or other combinatorial techniques.
   - The provided functions do not perform any operations that would help in counting permutations based on the given constraints. They are focused on number theory and modular arithmetic, which are not directly applicable to the problem.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not solve the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
