### Reasoning:

1. **Factorial Precomputation**:
   - The program precomputes factorials up to 200,001 using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers. This is necessary because the number of permutations can be very large, and we need to compute them modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation \(n\), the number of prefix maximums \(m_1\), and the number of suffix maximums \(m_2\).
   - It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

3. **Validation**:
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index is the same as the first suffix maximum index, and if the first prefix maximum index is 1 and the last suffix maximum index is \(n\). If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, indicating no valid permutations.

4. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The program uses a combination function `func_2` to calculate the number of ways to arrange the elements between the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It iterates over the suffix maximums and calculates the combinations for the gaps between them.
   - It then reverses the prefix maximums and performs similar calculations.

5. **Permutation Count**:
   - The program multiplies the results of the combination calculations with the factorials of the gaps between the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure it fits within the required constraints.

6. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used to compute the modular inverse of a number. It is crucial for the combination calculation in `func_2`.
   - The function uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which helps in finding the modular inverse.

7. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the combination \( \binom{a}{b} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using the precomputed factorials and the modular inverse from `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. The use of modular arithmetic and precomputed factorials ensures that the program can handle large inputs efficiently. The validation steps and combination calculations are appropriate for the problem requirements.
