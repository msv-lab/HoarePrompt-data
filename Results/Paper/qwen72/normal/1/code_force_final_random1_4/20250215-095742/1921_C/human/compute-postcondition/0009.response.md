To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `i` is 0
- `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4
- `feat` is a list of integers from the input
- `n` is equal to the first element of `feat`
- `f` is equal to the second element of `feat`
- `a` is equal to the third element of `feat`
- `b` is equal to the last element of `feat`
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input
- `array2` is an empty list

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `n`.
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because `range(1, n)` will generate values from 1 to `n-1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `i` should be 1 (the starting value of the loop).
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the input, `f` is equal to the second element of `feat`, `a` is equal to the third element of `feat`, `b` is equal to the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `array2` is an empty list.**
