The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1. If `i` is 1 and the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, `array2` has a new element which is `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. If `i` is 1 and the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is not less than `b / a`, `array2` remains unchanged.**
