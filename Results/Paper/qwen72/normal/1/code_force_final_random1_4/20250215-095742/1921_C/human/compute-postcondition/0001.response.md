To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `test_cases`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is the loop counter and is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.
2. **Variable `test_cases`**: This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.

Since `test_cases` is already guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `test_cases`. However, we need to initialize `i` to 0 for the loop to start correctly.

State: **`i` is 0, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4**
