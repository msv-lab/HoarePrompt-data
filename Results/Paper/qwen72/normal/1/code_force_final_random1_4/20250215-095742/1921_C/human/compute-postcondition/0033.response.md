To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `array2` is an empty list.
- `i` is `feat[0]`.
- `n` is `feat[0]`.
- `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.
- `feat` is a list of integers from the new input.
- `f` is `feat[1]`.
- `a` is the third element of the new `feat`.
- `b` is the last element of the new `feat`.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if the range `range(1, n)` contains at least one value. This means `n` must be greater than 1.
- The variable `i` is used as the loop counter, and it starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
- `i` should be 1 at the start of the loop.

### Final State:
- `array2` remains an empty list.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `test_cases` remains an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.
- `feat` remains a list of integers from the new input.
- `f` remains `feat[1]`.
- `a` remains the third element of the new `feat`.
- `b` remains the last element of the new `feat`.
- `arr` remains a list of integers read from the input.

### State:
**`array2` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the new input, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is the third element of the new `feat`, `b` is the last element of the new `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**
