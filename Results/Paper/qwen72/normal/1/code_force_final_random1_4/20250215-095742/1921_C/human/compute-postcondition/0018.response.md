Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the input, `f` is equal to the second element of `feat`, `a` is equal to the third element of `feat`, `b` is equal to the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, and `array2` is a list that may contain one element. If `arr[3] - arr[2] < b / a`, `array2` contains one element which is the result of `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` contains one element which is the result of `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`.***
