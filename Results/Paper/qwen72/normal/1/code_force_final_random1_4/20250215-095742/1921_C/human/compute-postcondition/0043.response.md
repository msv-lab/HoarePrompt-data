Output State: **`array2` contains all the elements `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` where `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a`. `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the value of `feat[0]`, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the new input, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is the third element of the new `feat`, `b` is the last element of the new `feat`, and `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**

### Explanation:
- **`array2`**: This list will contain the values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each index `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is true. Each iteration of the loop checks the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` and appends the result to `array2` if the condition is met.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.
- **`n`**: This remains the same as the initial value of `feat[0]`.
- **`test_cases`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`feat`**: This list remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`f`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`b`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`arr`**: This list remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
