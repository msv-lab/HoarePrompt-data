To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `array2` contains all the results of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is met.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is the length of the list `arr`.
   - `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.
   - `feat` is a list of integers from the new input.
   - `f` is `feat[1]`.
   - `a` is `feat[2]`.
   - `b` is `feat[-1]`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - The sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`.

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` determines which differences between consecutive elements of `arr` are included in `array2`.
   - The sum of the elements in `array2` is calculated.
   - The product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is added to this sum.
   - This total sum must be less than `f`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('Yes')`.

Given the condition that the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, the print statement will execute and print 'Yes'.

Output: **Yes**
