To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `array2` contains elements calculated as `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` where `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is the value of `feat[0]`.
   - `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.
   - `feat` is a list of integers from the new input.
   - `f` is `feat[1]`.
   - `a` is the third element of the new `feat`.
   - `b` is the last element of the new `feat`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - The sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`.

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The key condition is that the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` must be less than `f`.
   - This condition ensures that the total value calculated meets a specific threshold defined by `f`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is simply `print('Yes')`.

Given the condition that the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, the print statement will execute if this condition is met.

Since the condition is explicitly stated as being true in the initial state, the print statement will always print 'Yes'.

Output: **Yes**
