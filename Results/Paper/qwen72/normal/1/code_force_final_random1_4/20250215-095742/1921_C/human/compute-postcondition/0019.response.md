Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to the initial value of `n`, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the input, `f` is equal to the second element of `feat`, `a` is equal to the third element of `feat`, `b` is equal to the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, and `array2` is a list that contains elements based on the condition `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1`. Each element in `array2` is the result of `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` if the condition is met.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`.
- The variable `n` remains the same as its initial value.
- The variables `test_cases`, `feat`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial values.
- The list `array2` will contain elements for each index `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a` is true. Each element in `array2` is calculated as `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a`. If the condition is never met, `array2` will remain an empty list.
