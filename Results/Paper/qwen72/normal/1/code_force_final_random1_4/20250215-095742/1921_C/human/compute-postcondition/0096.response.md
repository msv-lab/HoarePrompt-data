Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, `array2` has a new element which is `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. Otherwise, if `i` is 1, `array2` has a new element which is `arr[0] * a`. If the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is not less than `b / a`, `array2` remains unchanged.***
