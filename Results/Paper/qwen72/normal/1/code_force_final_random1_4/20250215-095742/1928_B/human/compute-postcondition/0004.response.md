Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least one element, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, `tem` is `arr[len(arr) - 1]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `tem` (which is the last element of `arr`) to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` was an empty list, so now it contains the last element of `arr`. The values of `arr`, `tem`, and `i` remain unchanged.
