The value of `tem` is calculated as the product of the last two elements of `arr`. The `ans` list, which initially contains only the last element of `arr`, now has `tem` appended to it. The values of `arr` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least two elements, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr` and `tem` (which is `arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`), `tem` is `arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.**
