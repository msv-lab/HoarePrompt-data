The variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If `num` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is an integer such that 0 <= `num` <= 2 * 10^4 (original `num` divided by 10). For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must not be 0.

State: **`num` is an integer such that 0 < `num` <= 2 * 10^4 (original `num` divided by 10), `a` is the last digit of the original `num`**
