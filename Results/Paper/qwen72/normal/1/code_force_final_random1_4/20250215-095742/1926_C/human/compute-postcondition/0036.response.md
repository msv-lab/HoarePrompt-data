To determine what will be printed by the `print(pd[n])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant details:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `N` is 200001.
   - `pd` is a list of 200001 integers.
   - `pd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `N-1` is the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.

2. **Understanding `pd[i]`:**
   - For each index `i` from 1 to 200000, `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.
   - For example, if `i` is 10, then `pd[10]` would be the sum of the digits of the numbers 1 through 10, which is \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 1 + 0 = 46\).

3. **Execution of `print(pd[n])`:**
   - The statement `print(pd[n])` will print the value of `pd[n]`.
   - Since `n` is an input integer, the value of `pd[n]` is the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`.

Given this understanding, the output of the `print(pd[n])` statement will be the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **pd[n] (where pd[n] is the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to n)**
