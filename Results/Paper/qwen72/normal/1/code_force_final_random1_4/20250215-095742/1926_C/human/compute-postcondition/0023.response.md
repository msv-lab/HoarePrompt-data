To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given Information:
- `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5.
- `N` must be greater than `n + 1`.
- `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of the integer `1`, and `pd[i]` for each `i` from 2 to `n` is updated to `pd[i] + sum of digits of i`.
- `i` is `n + 1`, and `pd[n + 1]` is now `pd[n + 1] + pd[n]`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in str(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `j` and the string representation of `i`.
- For the loop to execute, `str(i)` must be a non-empty string.
- Since `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5, `i` will always be a positive integer greater than 1.
- Therefore, `str(i)` will always be a non-empty string, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- Since `i` is already set to `n + 1`, and `n` is within the specified range, no further adjustment is needed for `i`.

### Final State:
- The state before the loop starts should ensure that `i` is a valid integer that can be converted to a non-empty string.

State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5, `N` must be greater than `n + 1`, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of the integer `1`, and `pd[i]` for each `i` from 2 to `n` is updated to `pd[i] + sum of digits of i`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `pd[n + 1]` is now `pd[n + 1] + pd[n]`**.
