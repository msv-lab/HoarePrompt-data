Output State: **`num` is 0, `a` is the sum of all digits of the original `num`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `num` will be 0 because the loop continues to divide `num` by 10 until it becomes 0. The variable `a` will hold the sum of all the digits of the original `num` because each iteration adds the last digit of `num` to `a` and then removes that digit by dividing `num` by 10.
