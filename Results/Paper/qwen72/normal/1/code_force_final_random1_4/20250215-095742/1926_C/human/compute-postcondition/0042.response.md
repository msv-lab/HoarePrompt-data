Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and prints the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the results for each test case. The internal state includes a list `pd` of length 200001, where `pd[i]` contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`. **
