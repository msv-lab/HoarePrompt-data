The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` being less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, and `N` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `N` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Since `i` was `n` at the end of the last iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n + 1`. For the loop to continue, `N` must be greater than `n + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 Â· 10^5, `N` must be greater than `n + 1`, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of the integer `1`, and `pd[i]` for each `i` from 2 to `n` is updated to `pd[i] + sum of digits of i`, `i` is `n + 1`**
