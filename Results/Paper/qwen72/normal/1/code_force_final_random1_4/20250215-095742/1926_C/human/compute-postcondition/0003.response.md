The value of `num` is updated to the integer division of its original value by 10. This means the last digit of `num` is removed. The value of `a` remains unchanged as `num % 10` from the initial state.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 0 <= `num` <= 2 * 10^4 (original `num` divided by 10), `a` is the last digit of the original `num`.**
