The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to indicate that the loop will run `t` times. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`n`, `N`, and `pd`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0. The other variables can remain as they are.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 2 Â· 10^5, `N` is 200001, and `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `N-1` is the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`. The loop variable `i` will be equal to `N` (which is 200001).**
