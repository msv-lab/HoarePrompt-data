Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 Â· 10^5, `N` must be greater than 2, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of the integer `1`, and `pd[i]` for each `i` from 2 to `n` is updated to `pd[i] + sum of digits of i`, `i` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the variable `i` starting from 2 up to `n`.
- For each value of `i`, the loop goes through each digit of `i` and adds it to `pd[i]`.
- After the loop completes, `pd[i]` will be updated to include the sum of the digits of `i` for each `i` from 2 to `n`.
- The final value of `i` will be `n`, as the loop runs until `i` reaches `n`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `N` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
