Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 Â· 10^5, `N` must be greater than 2, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of the integer `1`, and `pd[2]` is now `pd[2] + pd[1] + 4`, `i` is 2, `j` is '2'**.

Explanation:
- The code `pd[i] += int(j)` updates the value of `pd[2]` by adding the integer value of `j` (which is 2) to the current value of `pd[2]`.
- Initially, `pd[2]` was `pd[2] + pd[1] + 2`. After executing the code, `pd[2]` becomes `pd[2] + pd[1] + 4`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `N`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
