The variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If `num` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is an integer such that 0 < `num` <= 2 * 10^3 (original `num` divided by 10). For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must still be non-zero.

Since the condition for the loop to continue is that `num` is not zero, and given that `num` is already an integer such that 0 < `num` <= 2 * 10^3, no adjustment is necessary as long as `num` remains within this range and is not zero.

State: **`num` is an integer such that 0 < `num` <= 2 * 10^3 (original `num` divided by 10), `a` is the sum of the last digit and the second last digit of the original `num`**
