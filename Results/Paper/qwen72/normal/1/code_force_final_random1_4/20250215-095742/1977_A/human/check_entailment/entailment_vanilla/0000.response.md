### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita starts with an empty tower.
   - In each move, he can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
   - We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because you can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `n` is equal to `m`, it's always possible to have `m` cubes by adding 1 cube in each move.
   - If `n` is greater than `m`, we need to check if the difference between `n` and `m` allows for the possibility of removing cubes and still ending up with `m` cubes.

3. **Conditions to Check:**
   - If `n == m`, the answer is "Yes".
   - If `m > n`, the answer is "No".
   - If `m == n - 1`, the answer is "Yes" because you can add `m` cubes and then remove 1 cube.
   - If `m % 2 == 0` and `n % 2 == 0`, the answer is "Yes" because both `n` and `m` being even means you can balance the number of additions and removals.
   - If `m % 2 != 0` and `n % 2 != 0`, the answer is "Yes" because both `n` and `m` being odd means you can balance the number of additions and removals.
   - Otherwise, the answer is "No".

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
   - It checks the conditions in the order specified:
     - `if n == m`: This is correct.
     - `elif m > n`: This is correct.
     - `elif m == n - 1`: This is correct.
     - `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`: This is correct.
     - `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`: This is correct.
     - `else`: This is correct.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles all the conditions and outputs the correct result for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
