The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop's execution depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is given as an input integer where 1 <= t <= 100, the loop will execute if `t` is within this range. The initial state of `i` should be 0, as it is the starting point of the `range(t)`.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is 0**
