Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers where 1 <= n, m <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if n == m:
        print('Yes')
    elif m > n:
        print('No')
    elif m == n - 1:
        print('Yes')
    elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `m` is an input integer. If `n` == `m`, then `n` and `m` are equal. If `n` != `m`, then `m` is not equal to `n`. Additionally, if `m` > `n`, then `m` is greater than `n`. If `m` <= `n`, then `m` is less than or equal to `n`. If `m` == `n - 1`, then `m` is exactly one less than `n`. Otherwise, `m` is not equal to `n - 1`, and if both `m` and `n` are even, the condition `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` holds true. If both `m` and `n` are odd, the condition `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0` holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is 1, and `n` and `m` are updated to the new input integers. If `n` == `m`, the conditions based on the relationship between `n` and `m` (equality, inequality, greater than, less than or equal to, etc.) are re-evaluated with these new values. If `m` > `n`, the conditions based on the relationship between `n` and `m` are re-evaluated with these new values. If `m` <= `n`, and specifically if `m` equals `n - 1`, the conditions based on the relationship between `n` and `m` are re-evaluated with these new values. Otherwise, if `m` <= `n` and `m` does not equal `n - 1`, the conditions are re-evaluated with the new values of `n` and `m`, and if both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd, the conditions are re-evaluated again with the new values of `n` and `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer. If `n` == `m`, the program does nothing. If `m` > `n` or `m` <= `n`, the program also does nothing, regardless of whether `m` equals `n - 1` or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
