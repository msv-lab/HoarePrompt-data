The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100) from the input. It then evaluates the relationship between `n` and `m` and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on specific conditions: 'Yes' if `n` equals `m`, `m` is `n - 1`, both `n` and `m` are even, or both are odd; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes its execution.
