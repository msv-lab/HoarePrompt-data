The code snippet `n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. This means the values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the new input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 100
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- Conditions based on the relationship between `n` and `m` (equality, inequality, greater than, less than or equal to, etc.)

After executing the code snippet, the new values of `n` and `m` are taken from the input, and the conditions based on their relationship are re-evaluated with these new values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are updated to the new input integers, and the conditions based on the relationship between `n` and `m` (equality, inequality, greater than, less than or equal to, etc.) are re-evaluated with these new values.**
