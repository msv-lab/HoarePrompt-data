Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining whether it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves is flawed. The program checks several conditions but misses a crucial point: the parity (odd/even nature) of `n` and `m` alone is not sufficient to determine the result.

A correct approach would be to recognize that after `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower can be any integer between `0` and `n`, inclusive, and the difference between `n` and `m` must be even for it to be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and the parity of the number of cubes will change with each move.

Here is a counterexample:
- Input: `n = 4`, `m = 2`
- Expected Output: `Yes`
- Actual Output: `No`

In this case, Nikita can start with an empty tower and perform the following moves:
1. Add a cube (tower height: 1)
2. Add a cube (tower height: 2)
3. Remove a cube (tower height: 1)
4. Add a cube (tower height: 2)

After 4 moves, the tower has exactly 2 cubes, which is the desired outcome. However, the program incorrectly outputs `No`.

To fix the program, the condition should be simplified to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

This corrected version will handle all potential cases correctly.
