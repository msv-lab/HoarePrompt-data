The provided Python code snippet simply contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`) and their relationships, but none of these variables or their values are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Output: **Yes**
