Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to `m`, and `m` is less than or equal to `n`. If `m` is equal to `n - 1`, then `m` is exactly one less than `n`. Otherwise, `m` is not equal to `n - 1`, and if both `m` and `n` are even, the condition `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` holds true. If both `m` and `n` are odd, the condition `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0` holds true.***
