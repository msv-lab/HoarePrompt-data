The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the content of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, and `n` and `m` are input integers.
2. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.
3. Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, the output will always be the same regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Yes**
