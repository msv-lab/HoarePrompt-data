The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides several conditions about the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`, but none of these conditions affect the execution of the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement does not reference any of these variables or their values.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `n` is not equal to `m`.
- `m` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.
- `m` is even.
- `n` is even.

These conditions do not influence the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
