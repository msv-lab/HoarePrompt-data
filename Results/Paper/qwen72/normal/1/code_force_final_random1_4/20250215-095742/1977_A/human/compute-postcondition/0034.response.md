Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is 1, and `n` and `m` are updated to the new input integers. If `m` equals `n - 1`, the conditions based on the relationship between `n` and `m` (equality, inequality, greater than, less than or equal to, etc.) are re-evaluated with these new values. Otherwise, the conditions are re-evaluated with the new values of `n` and `m`, and if both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd, the conditions are re-evaluated again with the new values of `n` and `m`.***
