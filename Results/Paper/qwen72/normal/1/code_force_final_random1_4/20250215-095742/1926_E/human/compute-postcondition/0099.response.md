Output State: **_ is t - 1, t remains unchanged, n is 0, k is the second input integer, m is the last computed value of (n + 1) // 2 before n became 0 or non-positive, L is a list containing at least two values of (n + 1) // 2 computed during the loop, pow is 4, a is the second element in L, tot is updated to tot + a.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pow` is multiplied by 2, changing from 2 to 4.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `L`, `a`, `tot`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
