The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from it. Since `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` will be `n - (n + 1) // 2`. This simplifies to `n - (n // 2 + 1 // 2)`, which further simplifies to `n - (n // 2)` because `1 // 2` is 0. Therefore, the new value of `n` is `n - n // 2`.

The other variables (`t`, `k`, `L`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is updated to `n - n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
