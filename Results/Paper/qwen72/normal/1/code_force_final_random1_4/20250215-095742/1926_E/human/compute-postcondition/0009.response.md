Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the value `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `m` is set to `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the same as the value already stored in the list `L`. No other variables are affected, so their initial conditions remain unchanged.
