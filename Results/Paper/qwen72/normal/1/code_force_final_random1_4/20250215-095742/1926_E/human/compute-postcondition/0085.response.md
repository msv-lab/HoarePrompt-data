Output State: **`_` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is now \(n - (n + 1) // 2\), `k` is the second input integer, `m` is \((n + 1) // 2\) (based on the original value of `n`), `L` is a list containing the value of \((n + 1) // 2\) (before the update of `n`), the new value of `m`, and the new value of `m` again, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1.**
