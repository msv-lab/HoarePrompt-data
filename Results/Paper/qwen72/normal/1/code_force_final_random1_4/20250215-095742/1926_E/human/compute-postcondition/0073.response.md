Output State: **`_` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the last computed value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` became 0 or non-positive, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` (which is 0), `pow` is \(2^{\text{length of } L}\) (which is 1).**
