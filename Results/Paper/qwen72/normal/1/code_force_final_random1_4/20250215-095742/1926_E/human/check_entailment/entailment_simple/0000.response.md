Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining the k-th card laid down by Vladislav according to the specified rules. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This is correctly implemented using a loop that runs `t` times.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes an empty list `L` to store the number of cards laid down in each step.
   - It uses a while loop to simulate the process of laying down cards:
     - `m = (n + 1) // 2` calculates the number of cards that can be laid down in the current step (i.e., the number of odd-numbered cards or multiples of odd numbers).
     - `n -= m` updates `n` to reflect the remaining cards after the current step.
     - `L.append(m)` records the number of cards laid down in the current step.

3. **Determining the k-th Card**:
   - It initializes `tot` to 0, which keeps track of the cumulative number of cards laid down.
   - It initializes `pow` to 1, which represents the multiplier for the current step (1 for odd numbers, 2 for twice an odd number, etc.).
   - It iterates over the list `L` to find the step where the k-th card is laid down:
     - If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, it means the k-th card is laid down in the current step.
     - The card number is calculated as `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`, which correctly identifies the k-th card in the current step.
     - `tot` is updated to include the number of cards laid down in the current step.
     - `pow` is doubled for the next step.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the k-th card for each test case.

The logic and implementation align with the problem description and handle the constraints correctly. The program correctly simulates the process of laying down cards and determines the k-th card laid down.

Correctness: **True**
