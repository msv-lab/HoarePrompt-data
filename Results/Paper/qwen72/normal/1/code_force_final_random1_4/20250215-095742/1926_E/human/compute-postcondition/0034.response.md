The code snippet `pow *= 2` multiplies the current value of `pow` by 2. Given that the initial value of `pow` is 4, after executing this line, `pow` will be 8. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing at least three elements, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0, `pow` is 8, and if `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, then `tot` is updated to `tot + a` where `a` is the next element in `L`. Otherwise, `tot` remains unchanged.**
