Output State: **_ is t - 1, t remains unchanged, n is 0, k is the second input integer, m is the last computed value of (n + 1) // 2 before n became 0 or non-positive, L is a list containing at least one value of (n + 1) // 2 computed during the loop, tot is a + the previous value of tot, pow is 1, a is the first element in L. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then the current value of `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`.**
