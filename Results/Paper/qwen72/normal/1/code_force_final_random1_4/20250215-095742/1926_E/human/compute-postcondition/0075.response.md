Output State: **`_` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is now \((n + 1) // 2\), `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated to \((n + 1) // 2\).
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
