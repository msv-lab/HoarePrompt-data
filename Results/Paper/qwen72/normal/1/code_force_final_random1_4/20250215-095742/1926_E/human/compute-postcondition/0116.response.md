Output State: **`n` and `k` retain their initial values (positive integers between 1 and 50,000), `_` remains a placeholder, `s` equals `k` or the sum of the series of `(d + 1) // 2` until `s >= k` or `d <= 0`, `i` is the number of iterations it took to reach this condition, `d` is the remaining value after subtracting `(d + 1) // 2` from `n` multiple times, `h` is the remaining value after subtracting `(h + 1) // 2` from `h` `i-1` times, `p` is `i`, `g` is the sum of the series of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is now `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`**.
