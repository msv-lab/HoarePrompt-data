To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop condition:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `L` is an empty list.

The loop condition is:
```python
while n:
```

This means the loop will execute as long as `n` is truthy (i.e., non-zero). Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `L` is an empty list.

We need to ensure that `n` is non-zero. Since `n` is an input integer, it can be any integer, including zero. To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust `n` to be a non-zero integer.

Thus, the modified state should be:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list**.
