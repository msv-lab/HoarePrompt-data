Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 50,000.
- `s` is either equal to `k` or the sum of the series `(d + 1) // 2` until `s >= k` or `d <= 0`.
- `i` is the number of iterations it took to reach the condition for `s`.
- `d` is the remaining value after subtracting `(d + 1) // 2` from `n` multiple times.
- `h` is the remaining value after subtracting `(h + 1) // 2` from `h` `i-1` times.
- `p` is equal to `i`.
- `g` is the sum of the series `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration.
- `f` is `k - g`.
- `y` is explicitly set to `2`.

Given that `y` is explicitly set to `2`, the `print(y)` statement will print the value of `y`, which is `2`.

Output: **2**
