Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged. The variable `L` is a list containing the values of the sequence of `(n + 1) // 2` computed during each iteration until `n` becomes 0. The variable `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` up to the point where the condition `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a` is no longer satisfied. The variable `pow` is 2 raised to the power of the number of elements in `L`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing:
- `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` stay the same as they were initially.
- `L` contains the sequence of values computed during the loop.
- `tot` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `L` up to the point where the condition for printing is no longer met.
- `pow` is 2 raised to the power of the number of elements in `L`.
