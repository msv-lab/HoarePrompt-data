Output State: **_ is t - 1, t remains unchanged, n is 0, k is the second input integer, m is the last computed value of (n + 1) // 2 before n became 0 or non-positive, L is a list containing all the values of (n + 1) // 2 computed during the loop, tot is 0, pow is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pow = 1` does not change the value of `pow` since it was already set to 1 in the initial state. Therefore, all other variables remain unchanged from their initial values.
