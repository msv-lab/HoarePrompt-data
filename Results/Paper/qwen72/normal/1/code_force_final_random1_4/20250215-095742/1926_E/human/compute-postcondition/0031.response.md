Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\).
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `L` is a list containing at least three elements.
- `m` is the last value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` becomes 0.
- `pow` is 4.
- `tot` is updated to `tot + a` where `a` is the next element in `L`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - `t` and `k` are input integers.
   - `n` is initialized to 0.
   - `L` is a list with at least three elements.
   - `m` is the last value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` becomes 0. Since `n` starts at 0 and is never incremented, \((n + 1) // 2\) is always 0. Therefore, `m` is 0.
   - `pow` is 4.
   - `tot` is initially 0 and is updated by adding the next element in `L`.

2. **Update of `tot`:**
   - `tot` is updated to `tot + a` where `a` is the next element in `L`.
   - Since `L` has at least three elements, let's denote the elements of `L` as `L[0]`, `L[1]`, `L[2]`, etc.
   - If `L` is `[a1, a2, a3, ...]`, then `tot` will be updated to `a1` if `L[0]` is the next element.

3. **Calculation in the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))`.
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `pow` is 4.
     - `tot` is `a1` (the first element of `L`).
     - `k` is the input integer.
   - The expression inside the print statement becomes:
     \[
     4 * (2 * (k - a1) - 1)
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression:
     \[
     4 * (2k - 2a1 - 1)
     \]
     \[
     8k - 8a1 - 4
     \]

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the result of the expression \(8k - 8a1 - 4\), where `a1` is the first element of the list `L`.

Output: **8k - 8a1 - 4 (where k is the input integer and a1 is the first element of the list L)**
