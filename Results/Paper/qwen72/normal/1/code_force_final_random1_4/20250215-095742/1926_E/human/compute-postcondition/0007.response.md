The code snippet `L.append(m)` appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, where `n` is updated to `n - n // 2`. The list `L` was initially empty.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is updated to `n - n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the value `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
