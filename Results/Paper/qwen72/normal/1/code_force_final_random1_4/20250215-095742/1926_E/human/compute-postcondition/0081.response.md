Output State: **`_` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is now \(n - (n + 1) // 2\) - \((n + 1) // 2\), `k` is the second input integer, `m` is \((n + 1) // 2\) (after the update of `n`), `L` is a list containing the value of \((n + 1) // 2\) (before the update of `n`) and the new value of `m`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `_` remains `t - 1`.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged.
- The value of `n` is updated to \(n - (n + 1) // 2\) - \((n + 1) // 2\).
- The value of `k` remains the second input integer.
- The value of `m` is updated to \((n + 1) // 2\) after the update of `n`.
- The list `L` initially contains the value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before the update of `n`. After the code execution, `L` now also contains the new value of `m`.
- The value of `tot` remains 0.
- The value of `pow` remains 1.
