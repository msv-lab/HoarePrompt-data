Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing at least two elements, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0, `pow` is 4, `tot` is updated to `tot + a` where `a` is the next element in `L`.** 

The value of `pow` is now 4, as it was initially 2 and then multiplied by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
