Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the values of the sequence of `(n + 1) // 2` computed during each iteration until `n` becomes 0, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0, `tot` is 0.** 

The variable `tot` is initialized to 0, while the other variables retain their initial values. The list `L` remains empty because no iterations have occurred yet, and `m` is undefined as `n` is already 0.
