Output State: **`_` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` must be a positive integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is \((n + 1) // 2\), `L` is a list containing the value of \((n + 1) // 2\) (before the update of `n`) and the new value of `m`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated to \((n + 1) // 2\).
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
