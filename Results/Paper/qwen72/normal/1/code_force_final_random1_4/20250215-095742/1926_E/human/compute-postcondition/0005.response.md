Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `m` is assigned the value of `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `L`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
