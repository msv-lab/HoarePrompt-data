The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the range is determined by `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is given as an input integer with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, this already ensures that `t` is at least 1, which means the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0** 

However, since the initial state already guarantees that `t` is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, no adjustment is necessary. Thus, the final state remains:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4**
