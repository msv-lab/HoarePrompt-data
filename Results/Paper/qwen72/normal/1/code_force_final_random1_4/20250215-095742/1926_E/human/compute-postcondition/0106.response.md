Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, the variable `_` is equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial value. For each iteration, the variables `n` and `k` are reset based on the input provided for that specific test case. The variable `m` is the last computed value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` became 0 or non-positive for the last test case. The list `L` contains the values of \((n + 1) // 2\) computed during each iteration of the inner while loop for the last test case. The variable `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` for the last test case. The variable `pow` is \(2^{\text{length of } L}\) for the last test case. If the condition `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a` is met for any `a` in `L` during the last test case, the corresponding output was printed.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the loop counter `_` has reached the value of `t`, and the loop has processed `t` test cases. Each test case involves reading new values for `n` and `k`, computing the sequence of values for `m` and storing them in `L`, and then performing the necessary calculations to determine if and when to print the result based on the conditions specified. The final state reflects the results of the last test case processed by the loop.
