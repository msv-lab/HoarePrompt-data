Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    L = []
    while n:
        m = (n + 1) // 2
        n -= m
        L.append(m)
    tot = 0
    pow = 1
    for a in L:
        if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
            print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
        tot += a
        pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop has executed all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged. The variable `L` is a list containing the values of the sequence of `(n + 1) // 2` computed during each iteration until `n` becomes 0. The variable `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` up to the point where the condition `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a` is no longer satisfied. The variable `pow` is 2 raised to the power of the number of elements in `L`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has completed all its iterations, and the final state is as follows: `_` is incremented by the total number of iterations and must still be less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is 0 or a non-positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is the last computed value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` became 0 or non-positive, `L` is a list containing all the values of `m` computed during each iteration, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, `pow` is \(2^{\text{length of } L}\). If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a` for any `a` in `L`, the corresponding output was printed during the loop execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is t - 1, t remains unchanged, n is 0, k is the second input integer, m is the last computed value of (n + 1) // 2 before n became 0 or non-positive, L is a list containing all the values of (n + 1) // 2 computed during the loop, tot is the sum of all elements in L, pow is 2 raised to the power of the length of L.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
