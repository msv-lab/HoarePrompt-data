Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, the loop counter `_` remains 0, and either (i + 1 < n and the character at index `i` in `a` is '<', and the character at index `i + 1` in `b` is '<') or (the character at index `i` in `a` is '<', and the character at index `i - 1` in `b` is '<').**
