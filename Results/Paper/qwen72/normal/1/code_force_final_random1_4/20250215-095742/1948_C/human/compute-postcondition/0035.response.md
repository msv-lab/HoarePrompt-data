Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, the loop counter `_` remains 0, `i` is incremented by 2, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i + 1`. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
