You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an even integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. Each test case includes two strings of length n, consisting only of '<' and '>', representing the directions of arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all `t` iterations. For each iteration, `n` was an input integer, `a` and `b` were input strings. The loop counter `_` has incremented from 0 to `t-1`. For each test case, the loop has checked all odd indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` (if `n` is odd) or `n-2` (if `n` is even). If at any point during the loop, `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the loop would have broken and printed 'No'. Otherwise, it printed 'Yes' after completing all iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a 2xN grid with arrows pointing left (`<`) or right (`>`).
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and must reach cell (2, N).
   - The robot moves every second: first, it moves left, right, up, or down, and then it follows the arrow in the current cell.
   - The goal is to determine if the robot can reach cell (2, N).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two rows of arrows `a` and `b`.
   - It then iterates through the grid in steps of 2, checking specific conditions to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

3. **Key Logic:**
   - The program checks if there is a way to move from the first row to the second row and vice versa without getting stuck.
   - Specifically, it checks if there is a `<` in the first row and a `<` in the second row at positions that would block the robot's path.

4. **Conditions Checked:**
   - The loop iterates over odd indices `i` (1, 3, 5, ...).
   - It checks if `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i - 1] == '<'`.
   - If either condition is true, it prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a blocking condition, it prints 'Yes'.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program uses `print('No')` instead of `print('NO')` and `print('yes')` instead of `print('YES')`. However, the problem statement mentions that the output can be in any case, so this is not an issue.
   - The logic seems to correctly identify if the robot can get stuck in a way that prevents it from reaching the target cell.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine if the robot can reach the target cell based on the given conditions.
