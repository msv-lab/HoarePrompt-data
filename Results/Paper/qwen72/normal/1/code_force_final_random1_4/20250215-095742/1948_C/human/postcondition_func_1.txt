The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an even integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. For each test case, it calls another function `func_1` with `n`, `row1`, and `row2` as arguments and collects the results. Finally, it prints each result on a new line. The function does not return any value; its primary purpose is to process and output the results of the test cases.
