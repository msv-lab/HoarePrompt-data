Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, the loop counter `_` is 0, and either (i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
