You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an even integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`, consisting of '<' and '>'. The function checks if, for any odd index `i` in the range [1, n-1], the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` hold. If any such condition is met, it prints 'No' and moves to the next test case. If no such condition is met for all odd indices, it prints 'Yes'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it checks the conditions for the robot's movement. Specifically, the condition `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':` is not sufficient to ensure that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n). This condition only checks specific positions and does not account for all possible movements and interactions between the arrows in the grid.

A counterexample to demonstrate this issue:

Input:
```
1
4
>><<
>>><
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output from the program:
```
No
```

In this case, the robot can indeed reach the cell (2, 4) with the following path:
1. Start at (1, 1)
2. Move right to (1, 2)
3. Move right to (1, 3)
4. Move down to (2, 3)
5. Move right to (2, 4)

However, the program incorrectly prints "No" because it fails to consider all possible paths and interactions between the arrows. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
