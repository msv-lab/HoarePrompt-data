The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('12', end='')
```

This statement prints the string `'12'` and uses the `end=''` parameter to specify that no newline character should be added after the string. This means the cursor will remain on the same line after printing.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1441.
- `s` is a new user-provided string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
- `h` is the substring of the new `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive), which is the first two characters of `s`.

However, none of these variables (`t`, `s`, or `h`) are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement only prints the string `'12'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **12**
