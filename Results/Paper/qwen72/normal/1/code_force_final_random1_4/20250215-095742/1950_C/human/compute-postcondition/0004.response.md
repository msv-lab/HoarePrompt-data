Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is a user-provided string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
- `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive).
- The user input must be greater than 0.
- The current value of `h` is '00'.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('12', end='')
```

This statement prints the string '12' without adding a newline at the end (due to the `end=''` parameter).

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, it will simply print the string '12' as specified.

Output: **12**
