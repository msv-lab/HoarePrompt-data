Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a user-provided string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive), and the user input must be greater than 0. If `h` is '00', no changes are made to `h`. If `h` is not '00' and is less than or equal to 12, the integer value of `h` remains as is. If `h` is greater than 12, the integer value of `h` remains as is.***
