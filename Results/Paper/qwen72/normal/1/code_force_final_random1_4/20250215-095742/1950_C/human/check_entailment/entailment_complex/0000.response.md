Reasoning:

The program correctly processes the input as described in the problem statement. It reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s` representing a time in 24-hour format. The program then converts this time to 12-hour format and prints the result with the appropriate AM/PM suffix.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading a time string `s` in each iteration.
2. **Extracting Hours**: It extracts the hour part `h` from the string `s`.
3. **Converting to 12-Hour Format**:
   - If the hour is `00`, it converts it to `12` and appends `AM`.
   - If the hour is between `01` and `12`, it keeps the hour as is and appends `AM`.
   - If the hour is between `13` and `23`, it subtracts 12 from the hour and appends `PM`.
4. **Printing the Result**: It prints the hour in 12-hour format followed by the minutes and the appropriate AM/PM suffix.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including the transition from `12` to `00` and the correct appending of `AM` and `PM`.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
