Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the hour is between 01 and 09 correctly. For example, for the input "01:00", the program will output "1:00 AM" instead of "01:00 AM". The issue lies in the line `print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')`, which should be adjusted to ensure that the hour is always formatted with two digits. A corrected version of this line would be `print('{:02d}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')`.
