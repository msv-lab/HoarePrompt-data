Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format according to the problem description. It handles all edge cases, such as converting "00:00" to "12:00 AM" and adjusting the hour part of the time when it is greater than 12. The program also correctly appends "AM" or "PM" based on the hour value. Therefore, the program is correct.
