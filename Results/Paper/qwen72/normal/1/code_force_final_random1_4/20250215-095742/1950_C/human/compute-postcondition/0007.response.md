Based on the initial state:

- `s` is a user-provided string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
- `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive).
- The integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12.
- `h` is not equal to '00'.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(h, end='')
```

This statement will print the substring `h` without a newline at the end.

### Explanation:
- `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1, which represents the hours part of the time string.
- Since `h` is a valid hour in a 24-hour format and is less than or equal to 12, it can be any value from '01' to '12'.
- The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function ensures that no newline is added after printing `h`.

### Output:
Output: **h (where h is the hours part of the time string s, and h is a string from '01' to '12')**
