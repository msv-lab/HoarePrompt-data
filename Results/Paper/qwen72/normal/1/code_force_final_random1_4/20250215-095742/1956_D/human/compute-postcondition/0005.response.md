To determine what will be printed by the `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer read from input, where \(1 \leq n \leq 18\).
   - `a` is a list of integers read from input, where \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
   - `s` and `m` are the first and second values returned by `func_2(a)`, respectively.
   - `ops` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple.
   - `l` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`.
   - `r` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(l + 1, r + 1)` will print the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`.

3. **Explanation:**
   - Since `ops` is a list of tuples and it contains at least one tuple, `l` and `r` are the first and second elements of the first tuple in `ops`, respectively.
   - The `print` statement will add 1 to both `l` and `r` and then print these values.

Given the initial state, the values of `l` and `r` are specific to the first tuple in the `ops` list. Therefore, the output will be the incremented values of `l` and `r`.

Output: **l + 1, r + 1 (where l and r are the first and second elements of the first tuple in the ops list, respectively)**
