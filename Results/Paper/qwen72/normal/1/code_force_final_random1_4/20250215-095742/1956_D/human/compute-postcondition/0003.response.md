To determine what will be printed by the `print(s, m)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer read from input, with the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 18\).
   - `a` is a list of integers read from input, with each element \(a_i\) constrained by \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
   - `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by the function `func_2(a)`.

2. **Function `func_2(a)`**:
   - This function returns three values: `s`, `m`, and `ops`.
   - Without the implementation details of `func_2(a)`, we can only infer the types and general nature of these values based on common programming practices.

3. **Values Returned by `func_2(a)`**:
   - `s` is likely the sum of the elements in the list `a`.
   - `m` is likely the maximum value in the list `a`.
   - `ops` could be the number of operations performed or some other derived value, but it is not directly relevant to the `print(s, m)` statement.

Given this information, we can deduce the following:

- `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`.

Therefore, when the `print(s, m)` statement is executed, it will print the sum of the elements in the list `a` followed by the maximum value in the list `a`.

Output: **s, m (where s is the sum of all elements in the list a and m is the maximum value in the list a)**
