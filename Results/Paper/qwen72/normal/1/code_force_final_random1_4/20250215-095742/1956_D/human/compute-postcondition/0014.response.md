Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), `s` is the sum of elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the list `a`, and `pos` is not equal to `l`.**
