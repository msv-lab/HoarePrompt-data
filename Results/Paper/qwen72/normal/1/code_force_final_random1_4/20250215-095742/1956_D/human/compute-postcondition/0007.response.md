To determine what will be printed by the `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer read from input, where \(1 \leq n \leq 18\).
   - `a` is a list of integers read from input, where \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
   - `s` and `m` are the first and second values returned by `func_2(a)`, respectively.
   - `ops` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples.
   - `l` is the first element of the second tuple in `ops`.
   - `r` is the second element of the second tuple in `ops`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(l + 1, r + 1)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `ops` list contains at least two tuples.
   - `l` is the first element of the second tuple in `ops`.
   - `r` is the second element of the second tuple in `ops`.
   - The `print` statement will add 1 to both `l` and `r` and then print these values.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `l` and `r` are elements of the second tuple in `ops`, the `print` statement will output `l + 1` and `r + 1`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`, where `l` and `r` are the first and second elements of the second tuple in the `ops` list, respectively.

Output: **l + 1, r + 1 (where l and r are the first and second elements of the second tuple in the ops list)**
