The function `func_1` modifies a list `a` and a list `ops` based on the indices `l` and `r`. It ensures that all elements in the sublist `a[l:r+1]` are set to the value `r - l + 1` if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. It also appends tuples `(l, r)` to `ops` when modifications are made. If `l` equals `r` and `a[l]` is not 0, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and appends `(l, l)` to `ops`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the list `a` may have been modified, and `ops` will contain tuples representing the operations performed.
