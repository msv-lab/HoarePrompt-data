Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a). `s` is the sum of elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, and `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, and `pos` is the index of `mx` in the list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, then `s` is the sum of elements in the sublist `a[l:pos]`, and `s` is greater than or equal to `(pos - l) * (pos - l)`, and `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:pos]`.***
