To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer read from input (1 ≤ n ≤ 18)
- `a` is a list of integers read from input (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7)
- `s` is the first value returned by `func_2(a)`
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2(a)`
- `ops` is the third value returned by `func_2(a)`

### Loop Head:
```python
for (l, r) in ops:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `ops` contains at least one tuple `(l, r)`.
- The variables `l` and `r` are the elements of the tuples in `ops`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, `ops` must contain at least one tuple.
- The initial values of `l` and `r` should be the first elements of the first tuple in `ops`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer read from input (1 ≤ n ≤ 18), `a` is a list of integers read from input (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), `s` is the first value returned by `func_2(a)`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2(a)`, `ops` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `l` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`, `r` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`**
