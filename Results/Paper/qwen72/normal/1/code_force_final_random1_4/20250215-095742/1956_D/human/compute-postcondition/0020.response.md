Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a). If `s` <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), all elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` are set to \(r - l + 1\), and the tuple `(l, r)` is appended to the list `ops`. The sum `s` of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` is now equal to \((r - l + 1)^2\). If `s` > (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), `s` remains the sum of elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, and `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, with `pos` being the index of `mx` in the list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, then `s` is the sum of elements in the sublist `a[l:pos]`, and `s` is greater than or equal to `(pos - l) * (pos - l)`, and `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:pos]`.**
