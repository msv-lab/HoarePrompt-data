Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input (1 ≤ n ≤ 18), `a` is a list of integers read from input (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), `s` is the first value returned by `func_2(a)`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2(a)`, `ops` is a list of tuples that has been fully iterated through, and all pairs `(l, r)` in `ops` have been printed as `(l + 1, r + 1)`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state remains unchanged for `n`, `a`, `s`, and `m`.
- The loop iterates over each tuple `(l, r)` in the list `ops`.
- For each iteration, the values `l + 1` and `r + 1` are printed.
- After all iterations, the entire list `ops` has been processed, and all pairs `(l, r)` have been printed in the format `(l + 1, r + 1)`.
