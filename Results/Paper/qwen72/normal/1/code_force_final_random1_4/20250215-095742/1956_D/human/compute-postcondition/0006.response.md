The only objects in the loop head are the variables `l`, `r`, and the list `ops`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ops`. If `ops` has at least one more tuple, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ops` must contain at least one tuple, `l` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`, and `r` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must contain at least two tuples. After the last iteration, the first tuple in `ops` has been processed, so for the next iteration, `l` and `r` will be the elements of the second tuple in `ops`.

State: **`n` is an integer read from input (1 ≤ n ≤ 18), `a` is a list of integers read from input (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), `s` is the first value returned by `func_2(a)`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2(a)`, `ops` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, `l` is the first element of the second tuple in `ops`, `r` is the second element of the second tuple in `ops`**
