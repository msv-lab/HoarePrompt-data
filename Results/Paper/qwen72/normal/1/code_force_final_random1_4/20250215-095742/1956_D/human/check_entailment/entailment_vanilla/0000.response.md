### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array `a` by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
   - We can perform up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function is designed to handle a subarray from index `l` to `r`.
     - If `l == r`, it checks if the element at `l` is not zero and sets it to zero if necessary.
     - Otherwise, it recursively processes the subarray from `l + 1` to `r`.
     - If the element at `l` is not equal to the length of the subarray (`r - l + 1`), it sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array.
     - It returns the sum of the modified array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

   - **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`):**
     - This function calculates the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
     - If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to the square of its length, it calls `func_1` to process the subarray.
     - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the left and right subarrays around this maximum element.

   - **Function 4 (`func_3`):**
     - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the maximum sum, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that each subarray is processed to maximize the sum by setting elements to the MEX value.
   - The recursive approach in `recursive_maximize_sum` ensures that the array is divided and processed efficiently.
   - The overall approach seems to correctly handle the problem constraints and requirements.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The functions handle edge cases such as single-element arrays and arrays where the initial sum is already maximized.
   - The recursive approach ensures that the number of operations does not exceed the limit.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The logic and recursive approach are sound, and the functions handle the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: **True**
