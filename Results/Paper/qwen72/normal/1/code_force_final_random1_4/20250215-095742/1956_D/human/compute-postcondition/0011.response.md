The function `func_3` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its function signature. However, within the function, it reads an integer `n` from input, which represents the length of the array `a`, and then reads `a` as a list of integers. The constraints are that `1 ≤ n ≤ 18` and `0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7`.

Based on this information, the function's primary task is to process the input values and produce an output. Since the specific output is not provided in the problem statement, I will describe the general functionality:

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from input, where `n` is the length of `a` and must satisfy `1 ≤ n ≤ 18`, and each element `a_i` in `a` must satisfy `0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints.**
