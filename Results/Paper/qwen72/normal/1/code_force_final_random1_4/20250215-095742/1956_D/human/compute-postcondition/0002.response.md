The code snippet assigns the results of the function `func_2(a)` to the variables `s`, `m`, and `ops`. Since the initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers and `n` is an integer within a specific range, the function `func_2(a)` is called with `a` as its argument. The exact values of `s`, `m`, and `ops` depend on the implementation of `func_2`, which is not provided here. However, we can infer that `s`, `m`, and `ops` are now assigned the values returned by `func_2(a)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input (1 ≤ n ≤ 18), `a` is a list of integers read from input (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), `s` is the first value returned by `func_2(a)`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2(a)`, and `ops` is the third value returned by `func_2(a)`**.
