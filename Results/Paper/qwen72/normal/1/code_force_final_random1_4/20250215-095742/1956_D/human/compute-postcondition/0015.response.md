The function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` is called with the parameters `l` and `pos - 1`. This function call will affect the state of the program, particularly the variables involved in the recursive process. However, since the exact implementation of `recursive_maximize_sum` is not provided, we can only infer the changes based on the given initial state and the typical behavior of such functions.

Given the initial state:
- `l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a)
- `s` is the sum of elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`
- `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`
- `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`
- `pos` is the index of `mx` in the list `a`
- `pos` is not equal to `l`

The function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` is likely to modify the sum `s` and possibly other variables related to the sublist `a[l:pos]`.

Since the function is recursive and modifies the sum, we can assume that after the function call:
- The sum `s` might be updated to reflect the new sum of the sublist `a[l:pos]`.
- The value of `r` might be updated to `pos - 1` if the function adjusts the range of the sublist.
- The maximum value `mx` and its position `pos` might change if the function recalculates these values for the new sublist.

However, without the exact implementation, we cannot determine the exact new values of `s`, `r`, `mx`, and `pos`. We can only state that the function call will potentially update these variables.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), `s` is the sum of elements in the sublist `a[l:pos]`, `s` is greater than or equal to `(pos - l) * (pos - l)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:pos]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the list `a`, and `pos` is not equal to `l`.**
