Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical issue in the `recursive_maximize_sum` function. Specifically, the condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):` is not correctly identifying when to apply the MEX operation to maximize the sum. This condition can lead to incorrect operations being applied, especially in cases where the sum of the subarray is already large but not maximized.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 2 3 4
```
The expected output should be:
```
10 0
```
However, the current implementation might incorrectly apply operations and change the array, leading to a suboptimal sum.

Another issue is that the `func_1` function is called recursively without properly handling the base case and ensuring that the MEX value is correctly calculated and applied. This can lead to incorrect modifications of the array.

To ensure the program is correct, the logic for determining when to apply the MEX operation and how to apply it needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected.
