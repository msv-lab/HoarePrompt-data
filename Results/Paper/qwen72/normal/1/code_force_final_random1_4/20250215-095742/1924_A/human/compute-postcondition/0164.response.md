Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has been reset to 0, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to be reset to 0, `cur` is 0 or a bitmask representing the characters seen so far in the current sequence, `cnt` is less than `n`. If `cur & 1 << i` is 0, `tmp` is 'c' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.***
