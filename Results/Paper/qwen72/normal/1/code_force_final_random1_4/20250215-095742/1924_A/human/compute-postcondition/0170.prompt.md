Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The string s is of length m and consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    ans = ''
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
            ans += ss
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                break
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 or `k-1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with any number of characters, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, and `cur` is 0 or a value less than `(1 << k) - 1` depending on whether the final set of characters in `s` completed another full set of `k` unique characters. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the state remains unchanged. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is set to `k-1`, and `ans` is updated to the original value of `ans` plus the value of `tmp` followed by a string of 'a' characters of length `(n - cnt - 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 or `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` remains 1 or `k`. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is set to `k-1`, `ans` is extended by the character in `tmp` followed by `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters, and `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set. `cur` is the final value of the bitmask representing the characters seen in the current sequence.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 or `k + 1` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k - 1`. `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has been reset to 0. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to be reset to 0, and `cur` is 0 or a bitmask representing the characters seen so far in the current sequence, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to be reset to 0 and now includes the character `tmp` if `tmp` is not an empty string, followed by `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters, `cur` is 0 or a bitmask representing the characters seen so far in the current sequence, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the bit position where `cur & 1 << i` is 0 (if any), otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
