Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 1 << (`ord(ss) - 97`), `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus 97.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cur` is updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to its current value (which was 0).
- `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus 97, where `ss` is the first character of the string `s`.
- Therefore, `cur` becomes `1 << (ord(ss) - 97)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
