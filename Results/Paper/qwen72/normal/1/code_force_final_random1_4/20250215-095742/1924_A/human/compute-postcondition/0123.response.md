Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 or `k + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is now `1 << cur_ss`, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. Additionally, the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is now set (i.e., `cur & 1 << cur_ss != 0`).**
