The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, and `ss` is the first character of `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 2 characters, and `ss` will be the second character of `s`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 or `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97 (which is the ASCII value of 'a'). If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the first character of `s`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
