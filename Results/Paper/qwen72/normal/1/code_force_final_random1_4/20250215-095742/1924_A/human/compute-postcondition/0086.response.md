Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 or `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 3 characters, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character of `s` in the alphabet (0-indexed). If the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is not set, `cur` is updated to `cur` + 2^(`cur_ss`). Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
