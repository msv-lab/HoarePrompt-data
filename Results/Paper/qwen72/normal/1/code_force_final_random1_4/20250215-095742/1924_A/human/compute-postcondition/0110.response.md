The code `ans += tmp` appends the value of `tmp` to the string `ans`. Here's the detailed impact:

- `ans` is updated to include the character stored in `tmp`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `i` is `k-1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `s` is a new input string
- `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop
- `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0
- `cur` is the final value of the bitmask representing the characters seen in the current sequence
- `cnt` is less than `n`
- `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set

After executing `ans += tmp`:
- `ans` now includes the character from `tmp` appended to its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `k-1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0 plus the character in `tmp`, `cur` is the final value of the bitmask representing the characters seen in the current sequence, `cnt` is less than `n`, and `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set.**
