Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 or `k + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0, `cur` is the final value of the bitmask representing the characters seen in the current sequence, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set.**

Explanation:
- The variable `s` is updated to a new input string provided by the user.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `cnt`, `ans`, `cur`, `tmp`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
