Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case is defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. For each test case, the function checks if the string `s` can be divided into `n` segments such that each segment contains all `k` distinct characters. If possible, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" followed by a modified version of `s` that includes the necessary characters to form `n` valid segments. After processing all test cases, the function ends with the state of the last test case preserved in the variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur`. **
