Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 or `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a string containing the characters from the previous `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, and `cur` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cur = 0` resets the value of `cur` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `cur` was previously 0 or a value less than `(1 << k) - 1`, and now it is explicitly set to 0.
