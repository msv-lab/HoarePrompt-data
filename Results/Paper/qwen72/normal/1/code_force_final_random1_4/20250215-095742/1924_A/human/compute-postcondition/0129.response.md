Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 or `k + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `ans` is an empty string or the string containing the first character of `s`, `cur` is either unchanged or set to 0, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` was initially `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `s`, and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `ans` remains an empty string, and `cur` remains unchanged.***
