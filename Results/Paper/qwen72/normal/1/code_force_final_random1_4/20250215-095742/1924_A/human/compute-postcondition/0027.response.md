The value of `cur` is updated by adding the result of `1 << cur_ss` to its current value. The value of `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus 97. Since `cur` was initially unchanged (implying it was 0), the new value of `cur` will be `1 << cur_ss`.

For example, if the third character of `s` is 'c', the ASCII value of 'c' is 99, and `cur_ss` would be 99 - 97 = 2. Therefore, `cur` would become `1 << 2`, which is 4.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus 97, `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`.**
