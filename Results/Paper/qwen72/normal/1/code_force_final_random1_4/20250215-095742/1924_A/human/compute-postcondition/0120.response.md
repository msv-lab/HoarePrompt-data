The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop will execute. The state of `ss` will be the first character of `s` when the loop starts.

Given that `s` is a new input string, for the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character. Therefore, the state should reflect that `s` is not empty and `ss` is the first character of `s`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 or `k + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set.**
