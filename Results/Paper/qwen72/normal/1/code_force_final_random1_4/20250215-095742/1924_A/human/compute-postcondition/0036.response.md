Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with any number of characters, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, and `cur` is 0 or a value less than `(1 << k) - 1` depending on whether the final set of characters in `s` completed another full set of `k` unique characters. Additionally, `cnt` is less than `n`.**
