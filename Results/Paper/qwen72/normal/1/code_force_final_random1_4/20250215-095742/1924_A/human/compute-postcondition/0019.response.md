The value of `cur` is updated by adding the value `1 << cur_ss` to its current value. Since `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97, the value of `1 << cur_ss` is a power of 2 corresponding to the position of `cur_ss` in the alphabet (assuming `s[1]` is a lowercase letter).

For example, if `s[1]` is 'b', then `cur_ss` would be 1 (since 'b' - 'a' = 1), and `1 << 1` would be 2. Therefore, `cur` would be incremented by 2.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus 97, `cur` is `cur` + `1 << cur_ss`.**
