The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` updates the value of `cur` by setting the bit at position `cur_ss` to 1 in its binary representation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1 or `k`
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `s` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character
- `cnt` is 0
- `ans` is an empty string
- `cur` is 0
- `ss` is the first character of `s`
- `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus 97 (which is the ASCII value of 'a')
- The bit at position `cur_ss` in the binary representation of `cur` is 0

After executing the code:
- `cur` is updated to `1 << cur_ss`, which means the bit at position `cur_ss` in the binary representation of `cur` is set to 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 or `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus 97 (which is the ASCII value of 'a'), and the bit at position `cur_ss` in the binary representation of `cur` is 1.**
