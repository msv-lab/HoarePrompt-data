Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`, `i` is 1, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value of the suffix sums up to that index in `suf`, `sm` is updated to `suf[1] - smin[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `sm` to `suf[i] - smin[i]`.
- Given that `i` is 1, `sm` is now set to `suf[1] - smin[1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
