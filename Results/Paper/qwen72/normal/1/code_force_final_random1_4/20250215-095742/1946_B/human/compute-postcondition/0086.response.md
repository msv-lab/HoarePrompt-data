Output State: **`smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements, `i` is 0, `sm` is `suf[0] - smin[0]`, `n` must be at least 0, all other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, `suf`) retain their initial values and conditions. Additionally, either `suf[0] - smin[0]` is greater than `-111`, or `sm` is equal to `suf[0] - smin[0]`.**
