The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 1), and `n` must still be at least 0.

State: **`smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 0, and all other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, `suf`) retain their initial values and conditions. If `suf[0] - smin[0]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is `-111`, then `sm` is updated to `suf[0] - smin[0]`. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.**
