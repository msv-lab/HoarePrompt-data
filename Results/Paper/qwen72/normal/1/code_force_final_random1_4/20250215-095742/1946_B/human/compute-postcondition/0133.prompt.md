Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements with the first element being 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `t` retains its initial value and conditions, `j` is `j + 1`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `suf` is now `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[:n])]`, and `sm` is updated based on the condition: if `sm` is less than 0, `sm` is now equal to `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10`; otherwise, `sm` is now equal to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if suf[i + 1] < smin[i]:
        smin.append(suf[i + 1])
    else:
        smin.append(smin[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`smin` is a list containing `n + 2` elements with the first element being 0. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, the last element of `smin` is `suf[i + 1]`. Otherwise, the last element of `smin` is 0. `i` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be greater than 0, `t` retains its initial value and conditions, `j` is `j + 1`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `suf` is now `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[:n])]`, and `sm` is updated based on the condition: if `sm` is less than 0, `sm` is now equal to `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10`; otherwise, `sm` is now equal to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `smin` is a list containing `n + 3` elements with the first element being 0. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, the last element of `smin` is `suf[i + 1]`, and the second-to-last element is also `suf[i + 1]`. Otherwise, the last element of `smin` is `smin[i]` (which is `smin[1]`), and the second-to-last element is 0. `i` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be greater than 1, `t` retains its initial value and conditions, `j` is `j + 1`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `suf` is now `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[:n])]`, and `sm` is updated based on the condition: if `sm` is less than 0, `sm` is now equal to `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10`; otherwise, `sm` is now equal to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`smin` is a list containing `n + 4` elements with the first element being 0. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, the last element of `smin` is `suf[3]`, and the second-to-last element is also `suf[3]`. Otherwise, the last element of `smin` is `smin[2]`, and the second-to-last element is 0. `i` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be greater than 1, `t` retains its initial value and conditions, `j` is `j + 1`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `suf` is now `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[:n])]`, and `sm` is updated based on the condition: if `sm` is less than 0, `sm` is now equal to `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10`; otherwise, `sm` is now equal to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
