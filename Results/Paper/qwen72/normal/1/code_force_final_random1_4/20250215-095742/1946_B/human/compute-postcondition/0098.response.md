Output State: **`smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 0, `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `suf` retain their initial values and conditions, `sm` is now equal to `2 + suf[n]`, `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by `10 ** 9 + 7`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is calculated as `2 + suf[n]`.
- The value of `a` is calculated as the absolute value of `sm` divided by `10 ** 9 + 7`.
- All other variables (`smin`, `i`, `n`, `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `suf`) retain their initial values and conditions.
