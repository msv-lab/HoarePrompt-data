Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`, `i` is `n - 1`, `smin` is a list containing one element which is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if suf[i + 1] < smin[i]:
        smin.append(suf[i + 1])
    else:
        smin.append(smin[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `smin` is a list containing two elements. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` contains 0 and `suf[n]`, and `suf[n]` is less than 0. Otherwise, `smin` contains two zeros, and `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`, `i` is `n - 2`, and `smin` is a list containing three elements. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` contains `[0, suf[n], suf[i + 1]]`. Otherwise, `smin` contains `[0, 0, 0]` and `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `smin` is a list containing four elements. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` contains `[0, suf[n], suf[i + 1], suf[i + 1]]`. Otherwise, `smin` contains `[0, 0, 0, 0]` and `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
