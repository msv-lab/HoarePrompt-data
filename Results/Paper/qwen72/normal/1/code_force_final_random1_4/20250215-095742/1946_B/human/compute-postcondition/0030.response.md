Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `smin` is a list containing four elements. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` contains `[0, suf[n], suf[i + 1], suf[i + 1]]`. Otherwise, `smin` contains `[0, 0, 0, 0]` and `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`.***
