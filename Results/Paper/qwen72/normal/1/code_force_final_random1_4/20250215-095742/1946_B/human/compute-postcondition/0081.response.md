Postcondition: ***`smin` is a list containing four elements (the original three elements plus either `suf[i + 1]` if `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`, or the element at index `i` otherwise). `i` is incremented by 1, `i` must be less than `n`, and all other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, and `sm`) retain their initial values and conditions.***
