Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 1, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing three elements `[0, l[0], suf[1] + l[1]]`, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The code `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])` appends the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]` to the list `suf`.
- Initially, `suf` is `[0, l[0]]` and `i` is 1.
- So, `suf[1]` is `l[0]`, and `l[i]` is `l[1]`.
- Therefore, `suf.append(suf[1] + l[1])` adds `l[0] + l[1]` to the end of `suf`.
- The new `suf` list is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1]]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
