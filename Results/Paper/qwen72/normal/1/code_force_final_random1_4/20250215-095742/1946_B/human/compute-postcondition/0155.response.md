Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` retains its initial value as an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `j` is `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all `t` iterations. For each iteration, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, and `l` is a list of integers from the input. `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`. `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value of the suffix sums up to that index in `suf`. `sm` is the final computed value for each test case, which is printed, and it is calculated based on the conditions provided in the loop.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and `j` is equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has completed. For each test case, the variables `b`, `n`, `k`, and `l` are set according to the input, and the lists `suf` and `smin` are computed based on the values in `l`. The final value of `sm` for each test case is calculated and printed, following the specified conditions.
