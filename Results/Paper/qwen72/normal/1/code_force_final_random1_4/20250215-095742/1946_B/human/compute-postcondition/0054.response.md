The code snippet `b = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is then assigned to the variable `b`. This impacts the value of `b`, which was initially described as a list of strings from the input. After executing this code, `b` will contain the split input.

The other variables (`t`, `j`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, `i`, `smin`, and `sm`) are not directly affected by this code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 1, `b` is a list of strings from the new input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`, `i` is `n + 1`, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value of the suffix sums up to that index in `suf`. If `sm` is less than 0, `sm` is updated to `suf[n] + 2 + (a + 1) * (10`. Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(suf[n] + 2) % (10`.**
