Let's break down the initial state and the operations to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `j` is 0.
- `b` is a list of strings from the input.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`.
- `l` is a list of integers from the input.
- `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value of the suffix sums up to that index in `suf`.
- `sm` is initially some value, but it is updated based on the following conditions:
  - If `sm` is less than 0, `sm` is updated to `suf[n] + 2 + (a + 1) * (10`.
  - Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(suf[n] + 2) % (10`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `suf`**:
   - `suf[0] = 0`
   - For each index `i` from 1 to `n`, `suf[i] = suf[i-1] + l[i-1]`.

2. **Calculate `smin`**:
   - `smin[0] = 0`
   - For each index `i` from 1 to `n`, `smin[i] = min(smin[i-1], suf[i])`.

3. **Determine the value of `sm`**:
   - If `sm < 0`, then `sm = suf[n] + 2 + (a + 1) * 10`.
   - Otherwise, `sm = (suf[n] + 2) % 10`.

### Final Output:
- The value of `sm` will be printed.

Given the conditions, the value of `sm` depends on whether it is initially less than 0 or not. Since the initial value of `sm` is not explicitly given, we need to consider both cases:

- If `sm < 0`, then `sm = suf[n] + 2 + (a + 1) * 10`.
- If `sm >= 0`, then `sm = (suf[n] + 2) % 10`.

Since the exact value of `a` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `sm` in the first case. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

### Output:
Output: **sm (where sm is either (suf[n] + 2) % 10 if sm >= 0, or suf[n] + 2 + (a + 1) * 10 if sm < 0, with suf[n] being the last element of the suf list)**
