Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `smin` remains a list containing `2 * n + 1` elements with the first element being 0. Each subsequent element in `smin` is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index. `i` is `n`, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be at least the number of iterations, `t` retains its initial value and conditions, `j` is `j + 1`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `suf` is now `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[:n])]`. The variable `sm` is updated to `2 + suf[n]`.**
