### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It reads `n` and `k` from the input and the array `l`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix sums of the array `l` and stores them in the list `suf`. This is done correctly using the loop:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])
   ```

3. **Minimum Suffix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the minimum suffix sum up to each index and stores it in the list `smin`. This is also done correctly:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       if suf[i + 1] < smin[i]:
           smin.append(suf[i + 1])
       else:
           smin.append(smin[i])
   ```

4. **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation**: The program finds the maximum subarray sum by iterating through the prefix sums and minimum suffix sums:
   ```python
   sm = -111
   for i in range(n + 1):
       if suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm == -111:
           sm = suf[i] - smin[i]
   ```
   This part is also correct.

5. **Final Computation**: The program computes the final result using the formula:
   ```python
   sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm
   sm += suf[n]
   ```
   However, there is a potential issue here. The formula `2 ** k * sm - sm` can be simplified to `(2 ** k - 1) * sm`. This simplification should be used to avoid potential overflow issues with large `k`.

6. **Modulo Operation**: The program correctly handles the modulo operation to ensure the result is within the required range:
   ```python
   if sm < 0:
       a = abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)
       sm += (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)
   else:
       sm = sm % (10 ** 9 + 7)
   ```

### Correctness:
Despite the minor issue with the formula simplification, the overall logic and implementation of the program are correct. The program correctly handles the input, performs the necessary calculations, and outputs the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

**Correctness: True**
