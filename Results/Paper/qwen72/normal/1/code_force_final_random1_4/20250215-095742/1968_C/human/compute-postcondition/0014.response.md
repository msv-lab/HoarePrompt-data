Output State: **_ is 1, `n` is an input positive integer (at least 1), `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`. The final value of `i` is `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the new input positive integer (at least 1).
- The initial state mentions that `n` was already an input positive integer, so the new value of `n` is still an input positive integer (at least 1).
- The other variables (`_`, `x`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet `n = int(input())`.
