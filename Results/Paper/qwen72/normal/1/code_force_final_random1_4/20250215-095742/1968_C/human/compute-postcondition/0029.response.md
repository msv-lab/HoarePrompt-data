The code snippet `a = [0] * n` initializes the list `a` to a list of zeros of length `n`. This overrides the previous initialization of `a` which was a list of length `n` with `a[0]` set to 1000 and subsequent elements set according to the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`_` is 2, `n` is a new input positive integer (at least 1), `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`, `i` is `n-1`.**
