The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `x`.

- The initial state is: `_` is 0 (loop counter), `n` is an input positive integer (at least 1).
- After executing the code, the variable `x` is now a list of integers, where each integer is derived from the input provided by the user.
- The values of `_` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input positive integer (at least 1), `x` is a list of integers derived from user input.**
