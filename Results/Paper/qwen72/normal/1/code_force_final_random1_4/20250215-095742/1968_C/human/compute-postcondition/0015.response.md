Output State: **_ is 1, `n` is an input positive integer (at least 1), `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`. The final value of `i` is `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `x` to a list of integers derived from user input.
- The initial state specifies that `x` is already a list of integers derived from user input, so the value of `x` remains the same after the code is executed.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the updated value of `x` being the list of integers derived from user input.
