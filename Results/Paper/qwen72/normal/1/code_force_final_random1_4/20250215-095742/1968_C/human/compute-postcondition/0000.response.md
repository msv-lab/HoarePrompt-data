The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter, and the number of iterations is determined by the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer since the loop will run from 0 up to but not including this value.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and `x_2, ..., x_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500.

However, these variables (`t`, `n`, and `x_2, ..., x_n`) are not directly involved in the loop head. The loop's execution depends solely on the input value.

For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input is at least 1.

State: **`_` is 0 (loop counter), the input must be a positive integer (at least 1)**
