Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x_2, ..., x_n are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] * n
    a[0] = 1000
    for i in range(1, n):
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is 0, `n` is an input positive integer (at least 1), `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`. The final value of `i` is `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 1, `n` is an input positive integer (at least 1), `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `a[0]` set to 1000, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is set to `1000 + sum(x[:i])`, `i` is `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `a[0]` set to 1000, `i` is `n-1`, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
