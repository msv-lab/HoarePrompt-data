The code snippet `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[i]` based on the values of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Given the initial state:

- `_` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `x` is a list of integers derived from user input
- `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `a[0]` set to 1000 and `a[1]` set to `1000 + x[0]`
- `i` is 2

Let's calculate the new value of `a[i]`:

1. `i` is 2, so `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`.
2. `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]`, which is `1000 + x[0]`.
3. `x[i - 1]` is `x[1]`.

Thus, `a[2]` is calculated as:
\[ a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = (1000 + x[0]) + x[1] \]

Therefore, the updated value of `a[2]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `a[0]` set to 1000, `a[1]` set to `1000 + x[0]`, and `a[2]` set to `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, `i` is 2.**
