Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `a[0]` set to 1000, `i` is managed by the loop starting from 1, `a[i]` is now `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[i]` is updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
