The code snippet `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[i]` based on the values of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Given the initial state:

- `_` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 3
- `x` is a list of integers derived from user input
- `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000, the second element is `1000 + x[0]`, the third element is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, and the rest are 0
- `i` is 3

Let's calculate the new value of `a[i]`:

- `i` is 3
- `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`, which is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`
- `x[i - 1]` is `x[2]`

So, `a[3]` will be updated to `a[2] + x[2]`, which is `(1000 + x[0] + x[1]) + x[2]`.

Therefore, the updated value of `a[3]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000, the second element is `1000 + x[0]`, the third element is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, the fourth element is `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 3.**
