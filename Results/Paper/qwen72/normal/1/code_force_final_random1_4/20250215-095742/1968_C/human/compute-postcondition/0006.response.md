The code `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[i]` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to the value of `x[i - 1]`. Given the initial state:

- `_` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `x` is a list of integers derived from user input
- `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000 and the rest are 0
- `i` is 1

Let's break down the changes:

- `a[1]` is updated to `a[0] + x[0]`.
- Since `a[0]` is 1000 and `x[0]` is the first element of the list `x`, the new value of `a[1]` is `1000 + x[0]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000, the second element is `1000 + x[0]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 1.**
