The code snippet `a[0] = 1000` updates the first element of the list `a` to 1000. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **_ is 1, `n` is an input positive integer (at least 1), `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `a[0]` set to 1000, the final value of `i` is `n-1`.**
