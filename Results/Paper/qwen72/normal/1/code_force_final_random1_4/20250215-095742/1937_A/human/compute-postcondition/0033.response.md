Output State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `power` - 1, `power` is `n + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 until `power` is no longer less than `n`.
- When the loop terminates, `power` will be equal to `n + 1`.
- For the loop to have executed at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. As the loop progresses, `n` must be greater than the current value of `power - 1` for the loop to continue executing.
- After the loop finishes, `power` will be exactly one more than `n`, so `power` is `n + 1`.
- The values of `i` and `n_cases` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
