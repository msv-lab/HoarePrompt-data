Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in how it calculates the position of 1 after performing the swap operations. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the position of 1 will always be a power of 2, which is not true for all values of `n`.

Let's consider a specific example where the program fails:

- For `n = 5`, the initial array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- Performing the swaps in order:
  - `swap(2)`: `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]`
  - `swap(3)`: `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]`
  - `swap(4)`: `[2, 3, 4, 1, 5]`
  - `swap(5)`: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`

After all swaps, the array is `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, and the position of 1 is 5. However, the program will output `4` because it incorrectly calculates the position based on powers of 2.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
