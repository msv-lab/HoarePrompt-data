To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `power < n`.

Given the state:
- `i` is 2
- `n_cases` is greater than 1
- `n` is `log2(n_cases)`
- `power` is 1

We need to check if `power < n` holds true for the first iteration.

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `power` is 1.
   - `n` is `log2(n_cases)`, where `n_cases` is greater than 1.

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - Since `n_cases` is greater than 1, `log2(n_cases)` will be a positive number greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute, `power` (which is 1) must be less than `n`.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Executes:**
   - We need to ensure that `1 < log2(n_cases)`.
   - Given that `n_cases` is greater than 1, `log2(n_cases)` will always be greater than 0. Therefore, `log2(n_cases)` will always be greater than 1 as long as `n_cases` is greater than 2.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The loop will execute at least once if `n_cases` is greater than 2.
   - Since `n_cases` is already stated to be greater than 1, we need to ensure it is at least 2 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary because the given state already ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is `log2(n_cases)`, `power` is 1**
