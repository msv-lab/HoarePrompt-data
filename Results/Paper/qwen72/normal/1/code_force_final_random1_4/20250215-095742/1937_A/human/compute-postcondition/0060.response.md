Output State: **`i` is `n_cases - 1`, `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, and `n` is the last input integer. If `n` is 1, the program prints 1. Otherwise, `n` is set to `log2(n)`, and `power` is calculated as described in the loop. If `power` is equal to `n`, the program prints \(2^{power}\). Otherwise, `power` is set to `n - 1`, and the program prints \(2^{power}\).**

Explanation:
- After all iterations, the loop variable `i` will be `n_cases - 1`, indicating that the loop has run `n_cases` times.
- The value of `n_cases` remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to 1.
- For the last iteration, `n` is the last input integer provided.
- The logic inside the loop processes this last `n` as follows:
  - If `n` is 1, the program prints 1.
  - Otherwise, `n` is converted to its logarithm base 2 (`log2(n)`).
  - The variable `power` is incremented until it is no longer less than `n`.
  - If `power` equals `n`, the program prints \(2^{power}\).
  - If `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is decremented by 1, and the program prints \(2^{power}\).
