The function reads an integer `n_cases` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n` and prints that value. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that the program has printed the results for each test case.
