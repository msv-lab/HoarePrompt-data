To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition specified in the `while` loop head, which is `power < n`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is 2 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `n_cases` is greater than 1 (used to calculate `n`)
- `n` is `log2(n_cases)` (relevant to the loop condition)
- `power` is 2 (relevant to the loop condition)

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `power < n` must be true. Given that `power` is 2, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 2.

Since `n` is calculated as `log2(n_cases)`, and `n_cases` is greater than 1, we need to ensure that `log2(n_cases)` is greater than 2. This means `n_cases` must be greater than 4 (since `log2(4) = 2`).

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n_cases` must be greater than 4, which implies `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 4, `n` is `log2(n_cases)`, `power` is 2**
