Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n_cases` is greater than or equal to \(2^{(n-1)}\).
   - `n` is \(\log_2(n_cases)\).
   - `power` is `n`.
   - The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2 ** power)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - From the initial state, we know that `power` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is defined as \(\log_2(n_cases)\).
   - Therefore, `power` is also \(\log_2(n_cases)\).

4. **Calculating the Output:**
   - The expression `2 ** power` is equivalent to \(2^{\log_2(n_cases)}\).
   - By the properties of logarithms, \(2^{\log_2(n_cases)} = n_cases\).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `n_cases`.

Output: **n_cases (where n_cases is the value of n_cases)**
