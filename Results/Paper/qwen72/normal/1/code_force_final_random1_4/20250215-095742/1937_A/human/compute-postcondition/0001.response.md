The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `n_cases`. For the loop to execute, `n_cases` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0**
