The function `find_position_of_one` accepts two parameters: `t` and `n_list`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `n_list` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the length of an array `a` for each test case, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function returns the position of the first occurrence of the integer 1 in each array `a` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, the number of test cases, and `n_list`, a list of integers representing the lengths of arrays for each test case. It returns the position of the first occurrence of the integer 1 in each array for each test case.**
