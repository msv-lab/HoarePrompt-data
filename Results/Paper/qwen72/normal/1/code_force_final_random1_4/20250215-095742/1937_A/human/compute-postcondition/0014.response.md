Output State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` is log2 of the input integer and must be greater than or equal to the final value of `power` - 1, `power` is `n + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 until `power` is no longer less than `n`.
- When the loop exits, `power` will be equal to `n + 1`.
- The condition `n` is log2 of the input integer remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` and `n_cases` also remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- Therefore, the final state of `power` will be `n + 1`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `power - 1` for the loop to have executed all its iterations.
