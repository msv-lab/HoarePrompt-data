Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n_cases` is greater than 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `power` - 1.
- `power` is `n + 1`.
- The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `power`**:
   - According to the initial state, `power` is initially equal to `n`.
   - It is also stated that `power` is `n + 1`.
   - This implies that the value of `power` changes from `n` to `n + 1` at some point in the program.

2. **Final Value of `power`**:
   - Since `power` is `n + 1` in the final state, the value of `power` used in the `print` statement is `n + 1`.

3. **Calculating the Output**:
   - The `print` statement is `print(2 ** power)`.
   - Substituting the final value of `power` into the expression, we get `2 ** (n + 1)`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the value of `2` raised to the power of `n + 1`.

Output: **2 ** (n + 1) (where n is the value of n)**
