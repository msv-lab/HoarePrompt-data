The value of `power` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `power` was 2, so after the increment, `power` becomes 3. The other variables (`i`, `n_cases`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` is log2 of the input integer and must be greater than 2, `power` is 3.**
