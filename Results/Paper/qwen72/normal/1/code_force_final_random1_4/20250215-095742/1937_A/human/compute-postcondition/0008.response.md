To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `power < n`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `i` is 0
- `n_cases` must be greater than 0
- `n` is log2 of the input integer
- `power` is 1

The loop condition is `power < n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `power` must be less than `n`.

- `power` is 1.
- `n` is the logarithm base 2 of some input integer.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. Since `n` is the logarithm base 2 of the input integer, this means the input integer must be greater than 2 (since log2(2) = 1, and we need `n` to be greater than 1).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state because the given conditions (`n` being the log2 of the input integer and `power` starting at 1) already ensure that the loop will execute at least once as long as the input integer is greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` is log2 of the input integer, `power` is 1**
