The value of `power` is decremented by 1. Initially, `power` was `n + 1`. After decrementing, `power` becomes `n`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` is log2 of the input integer and must be greater than or equal to the final value of `power` - 1, `power` is `n`, and `power` is not equal to `n`.** 

Note: The condition "and `power` is not equal to `n`." is no longer valid since `power` is now equal to `n`.
