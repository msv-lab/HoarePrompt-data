Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30, where n is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, a is the price for one yogurt, and b is the price for two yogurts on promotion.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
    if B * 2 < C:
        print(A * B)
    elif A % 2 == 0:
        print(int(A * C / 2))
    else:
        X = A // 2
        print(X * C + B)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user input, and the input value must be greater than 0. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, no changes are made. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and if `A` is even, no changes are made. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user input and each is greater than 0. If `B * 2 < C`, there are no changes to the variables. If `B * 2 >= C`, and if `A` is even, there are no additional changes. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `A` is the first integer from user input, `B` is the second integer from user input, `C` is the third integer from user input. If `B * 2 < C`, the values of `t`, `i`, `A`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `A` is even, the values of `t`, `i`, `A`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
