Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user input, and the input value must be greater than 0. Additionally, `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`. `A` is an odd integer. `X` is equal to `A // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `X` is calculated as `A` divided by 2 using integer division (`//`). Since `A` is an odd integer, `X` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `A / 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
