Reasoning:

The program aims to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts given the individual price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Condition Check**:
   - If the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is less than the promotional price (`C`), it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually, so the total cost is `A * B`.
   - If the number of yogurts `A` is even, it's cheaper to buy all yogurts in pairs using the promotional price, so the total cost is `int(A * C / 2)`.
   - If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, it buys as many pairs as possible using the promotional price and buys the remaining one yogurt at the regular price, so the total cost is `X * C + B` where `X = A // 2`.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1**: `A = 2`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
  - `B * 2 = 10` which is greater than `C = 9`, so use the promotional price.
  - Since `A` is even, the cost is `int(2 * 9 / 2) = 9`.
- **Test Case 2**: `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
  - `B * 2 = 10` which is greater than `C = 9`, so use the promotional price.
  - Since `A` is odd, the cost is `(3 // 2) * 9 + 5 = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
- **Test Case 3**: `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
  - `B * 2 = 10` which is less than `C = 11`, so buy each yogurt individually.
  - The cost is `3 * 5 = 15`.
- **Test Case 4**: `A = 4`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
  - `B * 2 = 10` which is less than `C = 11`, so buy each yogurt individually.
  - The cost is `4 * 5 = 20`.

The program correctly handles all these cases and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
