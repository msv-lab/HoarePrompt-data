The only variables in the loop head are `i`, and the input value that determines the range. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input value must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0, as it is the initial value when the loop begins.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is greater than 0, and `i` starts at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, the input value must be greater than 0**
