Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user input and each is greater than 0. If `B * 2 < C`, there are no changes to the variables. If `B * 2 >= C`, and if `A` is even, there are no additional changes. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.***
