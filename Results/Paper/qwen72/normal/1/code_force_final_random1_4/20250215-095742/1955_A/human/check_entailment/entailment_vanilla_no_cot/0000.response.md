Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly handles the logic for determining the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts under the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Condition Check**:
   - If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is less than the promotional price (`C`), it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price. Hence, the total cost is `A * B`.
   - If the number of yogurts `A` is even, it is optimal to buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price. Hence, the total cost is `int(A * C / 2)`.
   - If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, it is optimal to buy as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and the remaining one at the regular price. Hence, the total cost is `X * C + B`, where `X` is `A // 2`.

This logic ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly for all given test cases. Therefore, the solution is correct.
