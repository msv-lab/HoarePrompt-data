Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `A` is the first integer from user input, `B` is the second integer from user input, `C` is the third integer from user input. If `A` is even, the values of `t`, `i`, `A`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.***
