Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user input, and the input value must be greater than 0.
   - Additionally, \(B \times 2 \geq C\).
   - The current value of `A` is even.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(int(A * C / 2))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `A` is an even integer.
   - `C` is a positive integer.
   - The expression `A * C / 2` will result in a floating-point number if `A * C` is not divisible by 2. However, since `A` is even, `A * C` will always be even, and thus `A * C / 2` will always be an integer.
   - The `int()` function will convert this floating-point number to an integer, but since it's already an integer, it will remain unchanged.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement will output the integer value of `A * C / 2`.

Output: **A * C / 2 (where A is an even integer and C is a positive integer provided by the user input)**
