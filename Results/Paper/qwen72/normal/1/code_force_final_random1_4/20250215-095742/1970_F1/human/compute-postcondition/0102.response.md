Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, the following state is reached:**

- `i` is `n - 1`, meaning the loop has completed its final iteration.
- `n` remains the same as it was in the initial state, indicating the total number of iterations the loop performed.
- `line` is the last line read from standard input, split into a list of substrings.
- `ind` is `len(line) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the last line read.
- `grid` is a list containing `n` lines, each line being a list of substrings read from standard input.
- `elements` contains key-value pairs for all non-'..' substrings found in the entire grid, where the key is the substring and the value is a tuple `(row, column)` representing the position of the substring in the grid.
- `allPlayers` contains key-value pairs for all player substrings found in the grid, where the key is the player substring and the value is `False`.
- `goal` contains two lists, where the first list (`goal[0]`) contains tuples of positions for all substrings ending in 'G' whose first character is 'B', and the second list (`goal[1]`) contains tuples of positions for all substrings ending in 'G' whose first character is not 'B'.
- `points` remains unchanged as `[0, 0]` since the loop does not modify this variable.

This state reflects the complete processing of the grid, with all relevant substrings identified and their positions stored in the appropriate data structures.
