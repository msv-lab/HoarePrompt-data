The value of `team` is determined based on the condition `obj[0] == 'B'`. If the first character of `obj` is 'B', then `team` is set to 1; otherwise, `team` is set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `command` is a list of strings with length 3, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`, `el` is equal to ".S", `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.**
