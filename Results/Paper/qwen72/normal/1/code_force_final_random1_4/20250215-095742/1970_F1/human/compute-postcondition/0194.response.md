Postcondition: ***`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `t` is greater than 0, `time` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is `True`. If `el` is '.S', `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `len(command) != 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` before the update, and `nxt` is (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`). If `obj` is '.B', `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `obj` is '.B' and `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player, or if `obj` is a player and `nxt` is the position of '.B', then `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is increased by 1. If `isPlayer(obj)` is true, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.***
