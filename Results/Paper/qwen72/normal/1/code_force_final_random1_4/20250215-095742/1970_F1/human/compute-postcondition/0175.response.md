Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `time` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `el` is the third element of `command`.
   - `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.
   - `points[team]` is increased by 10.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `time`: This is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`. Since `t` is greater than 0, `time` will be a positive integer less than `t`.
   - `team`: This is determined by the first character of `obj`. If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1; otherwise, `team` is 0.
   - `GoalName[team]`: This is an element from the `GoalName` list, indexed by `team`. The exact value of `GoalName[team]` depends on the content of the `GoalName` list, but it will be either `GoalName[0]` or `GoalName[1]`.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will format the output as `%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH`, where `%d` is replaced by the value of `time` and `%s` is replaced by the value of `GoalName[team]`.

Given the above, the output will be:
- `time` is a positive integer less than `t`.
- `GoalName[team]` is either `GoalName[0]` or `GoalName[1]` depending on the value of `team`.

Therefore, the final output will be:
Output: **[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where [time] is the value of time and [GoalName[team]] is the value of GoalName[team])**
