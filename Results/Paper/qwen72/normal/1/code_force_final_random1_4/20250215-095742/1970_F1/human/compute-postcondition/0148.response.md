Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `obj` is the first string in `command`.
   - `com` is the second string in `command`.
   - `el` is the third string in `command`.
   - `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.
   - `points[team]` is increased by 10.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `time` is represented by `t`, which is greater than 0.
   - `GoalName[team]` depends on the value of `team`.
     - If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1.
     - Otherwise, `team` is 0.
   - `GoalName` is a list where `GoalName[0]` and `GoalName[1]` are assumed to be predefined strings (since they are not explicitly given in the initial state).

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `obj[0]` is 'B':
     - `team` is 1.
     - The print statement will be `print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (t, GoalName[1]))`.
   - If `obj[0]` is not 'B':
     - `team` is 0.
     - The print statement will be `print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (t, GoalName[0]))`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `t` and `GoalName` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.
   - If `obj[0]` is 'B':
     - Output: **%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where %d is the value of t and %s is the value of GoalName[1])**.
   - If `obj[0]` is not 'B':
     - Output: **%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where %d is the value of t and %s is the value of GoalName[0])**.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where %d is the value of t and %s is the value of GoalName[team], with team being 1 if obj[0] is 'B' and 0 otherwise)**.
