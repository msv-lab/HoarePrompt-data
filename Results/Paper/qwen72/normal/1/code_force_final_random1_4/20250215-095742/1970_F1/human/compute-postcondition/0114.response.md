Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `command` is a list of strings with length 3.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `el` is ".S".
   - `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.
   - `points[team]` is incremented by 10.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `time` is the same as `t`, which is greater than 0.
   - `GoalName` is a list where `GoalName[team]` is accessed.
   - `team` is determined by the first character of `obj`:
     - If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1.
     - Otherwise, `team` is 0.

4. **Possible Values:**
   - Since `t` is greater than 0, let's assume `t = 1` for simplicity.
   - `obj` could be any string, but let's consider two cases:
     - Case 1: `obj = "Ball"`
     - Case 2: `obj = "Broom"`

5. **Case 1: `obj = "Ball"`**
   - `obj[0]` is 'B'.
   - Therefore, `team` is 1.
   - `GoalName[1]` is accessed.

6. **Case 2: `obj = "Broom"`**
   - `obj[0]` is 'B'.
   - Therefore, `team` is 1.
   - `GoalName[1]` is accessed.

7. **General Case:**
   - If `obj[0]` is 'B', `team` is 1.
   - If `obj[0]` is not 'B', `team` is 0.
   - Let's assume `GoalName` is a list with at least two elements, for example, `GoalName = ["Home Team", "Away Team"]`.

8. **Final Output:**
   - If `obj[0]` is 'B', `team` is 1, and `GoalName[1]` is "Away Team".
   - If `obj[0]` is not 'B', `team` is 0, and `GoalName[0]` is "Home Team".

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:

- If `obj[0]` is 'B':
  - Output: **1 Away Team CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH**
- If `obj[0]` is not 'B':
  - Output: **1 Home Team CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH**

Since the exact value of `t` is not specified, we assume it is 1 for simplicity. The final output, considering the most precise description based on the precondition, is:

Output: **1 [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where [GoalName[team]] is "Away Team" if obj[0] is 'B', otherwise "Home Team")**
