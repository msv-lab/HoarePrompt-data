Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `t` is greater than 0, `time` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`).**

Explanation: The code snippet calculates the next position `nxt` based on the current position `pos` and the movement direction specified by `com`. The new position `nxt` is calculated by adding the corresponding values from the `mov` dictionary to the current position `pos`. All other variables remain unchanged.
