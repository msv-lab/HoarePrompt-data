Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `line` is the list of substrings read from standard input and must have at least 1 element, `ind` is 0, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` contains key-value pairs for non-'..' substrings in the new `line`, including the first element of `line` mapped to `(1, 0)`, `allPlayers` contains key-value pairs for player substrings in the new `line`, `goal` contains lists of tuples for substrings ending in 'G' in the new `line`, the first element of `line` (i.e., `line[0]`) is not equal to '..', the element at index `ind` in `line` is not a player substring. If the second character of the element at index `ind` in `line` is 'G', `tmp` is 1 and `goal[1]` now includes the tuple `(1, 0)`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.***
