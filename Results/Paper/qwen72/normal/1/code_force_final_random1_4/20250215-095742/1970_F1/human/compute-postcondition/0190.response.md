Postcondition: ***`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `t` is greater than 0, `time` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` before the update, `nxt` is (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`). If `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `isPlayer(obj)` is true, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.***
