Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `command` is a list of strings with length 3, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`. If `el` is ".Q", `allPlayers[obj]` is `True`. If `el` is ".S", `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is incremented by 10. If `el` is neither ".Q" nor ".S", the state remains unchanged.***
