Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with keys '.B' and the first element of `line`, and values (-1, -1) and (0, 0) respectively, `points` is a list with values [0, 0], `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and must have at least one element, `ind` is 0. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key being the first element of `line` and the value being `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is false, `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary. If the second character of the first element of `line` is 'G', then `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list is empty and the second list contains the tuple (0, 0), and `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists and `tmp` is not modified.***
