### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field (`n` and `m`).
   - It initializes the grid and various dictionaries and lists to keep track of the positions of players, goals, and the ball.
   - The program correctly parses the initial state of the field and stores the positions of players, goals, and the ball.

2. **Action Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the actions of moving (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), catching the ball (`C`), and throwing the ball (`T`).
   - It updates the positions of players and the ball accordingly.
   - The program correctly checks if a player is carrying the ball and updates the state when a player catches or throws the ball.

3. **Scoring:**
   - The program correctly identifies when a player scores a goal by checking if the player is at a goal position and prints the appropriate message.
   - It updates the score for the correct team based on the goal position.
   - The program also handles the case where a player scores in their own goal, awarding the point to the opposing team.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the final score after all actions have been processed.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as a player moving out of bounds (which is not possible due to the constraints) and invalid actions (which are guaranteed to be valid).

### Correctness:
Based on the reasoning above, the program appears to correctly handle all aspects of the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
