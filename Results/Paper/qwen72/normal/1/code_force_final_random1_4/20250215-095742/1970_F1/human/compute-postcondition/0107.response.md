The provided code snippet attempts to unpack the `command` list into three variables: `obj`, `com`, and `el`. Since the initial state specifies that `command` is a list of strings with a length of exactly 3, the unpacking will succeed, and each variable will take the corresponding value from the list.

- `obj` will be assigned the first element of `command`.
- `com` will be assigned the second element of `command`.
- `el` will be assigned the third element of `command`.

The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `command` is a list of strings with length 3, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`.**
