Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `line` is the list of substrings read from standard input and must have at least 1 element, `ind` is 0, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` contains key-value pairs for non-'..' substrings in the new `line`, including the first element of `line` mapped to `(1, 0)`, `allPlayers` contains key-value pairs for player substrings in the new `line`, `goal` contains lists of tuples for substrings ending in 'G' in the new `line`, and `tmp` is determined based on the first character of substrings ending in 'G' in the new `line`. Additionally, the first element of `line` (i.e., `line[0]`) is not equal to '..'. The element at index `ind` in `line` is not a player substring.**
