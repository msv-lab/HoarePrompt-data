The value of `team` is determined by the condition `obj[0] == 'B'`. If the first character of the string `obj` is 'B', then `team` is set to 1; otherwise, `team` is set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `t` is greater than 0, `obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `el` is the third string in `command`, `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' else `team` is 0.**
