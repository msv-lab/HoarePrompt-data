Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0, indicating that the loop has completed its execution.
- `time` has reached the value of `t - 1`, which is -1, but this is not directly relevant to the print statement.
- `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing the final state of players, with each key being a player identifier and the value being a boolean indicating whether the player is active (`True`) or inactive (`False`).
- `points` is a list containing the final scores for each team, with `points[0]` representing the score for Team 0 and `points[1]` representing the score for Team 1.
- `elements` is a dictionary containing the final positions of all objects, including players and the ball, with each key being an object identifier and the value being a tuple representing the coordinates of the object.
- `grid` reflects the final state of the game board, with the positions of players and the ball updated according to the commands executed during the loop.

The print statement is:
```python
print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
```

This statement will print the final scores for Team 0 and Team 1, where `points[0]` is the score for Team 0 and `points[1]` is the score for Team 1.

Since the exact values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe them in general terms.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where [points[0]] is the final score for Team 0 and [points[1]] is the final score for Team 1)**
