The only objects in the loop head are `ind` and `line`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `line`. If `line` has at least one substring, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0, but these conditions do not directly affect the loop's execution. For the loop to execute, `line` must have at least one substring, and `ind` should start at 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `line` is a list of substrings that must have at least 1 substring, `ind` is 0, `grid` contains `line` as its last element**
