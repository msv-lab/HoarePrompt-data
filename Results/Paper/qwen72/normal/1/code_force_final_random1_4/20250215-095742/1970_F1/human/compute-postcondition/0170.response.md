The provided code snippet attempts to unpack the list `command` into three variables: `obj`, `com`, and `el`. Since `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, the values of `obj`, `com`, and `el` will be the first, second, and third elements of `command`, respectively.

The variables `t` and `time` are not directly affected by this code snippet, but the condition that `time` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` remains valid.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`, `t` is greater than 0, `time` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`.**
