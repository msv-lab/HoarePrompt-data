Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `t` is greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The code reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to `command`.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still greater than 0.
- No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
