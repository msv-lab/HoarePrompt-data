The only objects in the loop head are the variables `ind` and `line`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `line`. If `ind` is less than the length of `line`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 0, and `line` is a list of substrings with at least 1 substring. For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` must be incremented by 1, and `line` must still have at least 1 substring remaining.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `line` is a list of substrings with at least 1 substring, `ind` is 1, and `grid` contains `line` as its last element. If the first element of `line` (i.e., `line[0]`) is not equal to '..': `elements` now contains a key-value pair where the key is the first element of `line` and the value is a tuple `(0, 0)`. If `line[ind]` is a player, `allPlayers` now contains a key-value pair where the key is the first element of `line` and the value is `False`. If `line[ind]` is not a player and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', `tmp` is 1, and `goal` now contains a key `1` with a value that is a list containing the tuple `(0, 0)` as its first element. If the first element of `line` is equal to '..', the state remains unchanged.**
