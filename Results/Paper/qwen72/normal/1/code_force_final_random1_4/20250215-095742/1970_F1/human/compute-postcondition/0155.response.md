To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`.
   - `nxt` is calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
   - `player` is determined as follows:
     - If `isPlayer(obj)` is `True`, then `player` is `obj`.
     - Otherwise, `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `time` is represented by `t`, which is greater than 0.
   - `player` is determined based on the conditions:
     - If `obj` is a player (i.e., `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`), then `player` is `obj`.
     - If `obj` is not a player, then `player` is the value at `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the current time (`t`) followed by the name of the player who is eliminated.
   - Since the exact values of `t`, `obj`, and `grid` are not provided, we can only describe the output in general terms.

Output: **%d %s ELIMINATED (where %d is the value of t and %s is the name of the player who is eliminated, which is either obj if obj is a player or grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]] otherwise)**
