Postcondition: ***`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `t` is greater than 0. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, and `el` is the third string in `command`. If `el` is equal to '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is `True`. If `el` is equal to '.S', `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' and to 0 otherwise, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `len(command) != 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` before the update, and `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is `.B`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `obj` is `.B` and `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player, or if `obj` is a player and `elements['.B']` is `nxt`, then `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, then `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. If `com` is not 'T' and `isPlayer(obj)` is true, `elements[obj]` is updated to `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `com` is not 'T' and `isPlayer(obj)` is false, `elements[obj]` remains unchanged.***
