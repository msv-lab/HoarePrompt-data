# Problem:
This afternoon, you decided to enjoy the first days of Spring by taking a walk
outside. As you come near the Quidditch field, you hear screams. Once again,
there is a conflict about the score: the two teams are convinced that they won
the game! To prevent this problem from happening one more time, you decide to
get involved in the refereeing of the matches.

Now, you will stay in the stadium to watch the game and count the score. At
the end of the game, you will decide the winner.

Today, two teams are competing: the red Gryffindor (R) and the blue Ravenclaw
(B) team. Each team is composed of P players (1 \leq P \leq 10 ).

The field is a rectangle of N lines and M columns (3 \leq N, M \leq 99 , N and
M are odd). All the positions are integers, and several entities are allowed
to be at the same position in the field. At the beginning of the game, the
field contains goals for the two teams (each team can own between one and five
goals), the players, and exactly one Quaffle. Other types of balls will be
available in the harder versions of the problem.

A game is composed of T steps (0 \leq T \leq 10000 ). At each step, one entity
on the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move.
A player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To
catch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle
does not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the
movements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it,
the Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player.

To win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team.
When it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly
moves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2 -th column of the
(N+1)/2 -th line of the field, starting from 1). There is no goal in the
middle of the field. If a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team
wins the point.

Input

On the first line, the integers N and M .

The description of the field follows: N lines of M pairs of characters
separated by spaces. Each pair of characters represents a position on the
field. It can be either:

  * .. to represent an empty cell 
  * R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9 to represent a player. The first character is the team of the player, and the second is the number of the player in the team. Each pair of characters is unique, but it is not guaranteed that all the pairs appear in the grid. 
  * RG or BG to represent a goal. The blue team tries to put the ball in a red goal (RG) while the red team tries to put the ball in a blue goal (BG). 
  * .Q to represent the Quaffle, which is the ball that the players use to score goals. 

The next line contains T , the number of steps that compose the game. T lines
follow, each describing one action. It contains several pieces of information
separated by a space. First, a pair of characters representing the entity that
must perform the action. Second, the description of the action:

  * U, D, L, R indicate that the entity moves on the grid. It can move to the top of the grid (U), to the bottom (D), to the left (L), or to the right (R). Each entity moves by only one cell at a time. 
  * C indicates that the player catches the ball (only a player can catch a ball). Then, there is a space followed by a pair of characters: the description of the ball caught by the player. This information is needed since in the next versions of the problem, several balls may be in the same cell. 
  * T indicates that the player throws the Quaffle that it is carrying. 

All the actions performed by the entities are guaranteed to be valid: the
players stay in the field, don't catch a ball if they are not in the same
cell, don't release the Quaffle if they are not carrying it, ...

Output

You must output the description of the main events of the game, one event per
line. More precisely:

  * Each time a team scores, you must print t RED GOAL or t BLUE GOAL, depending on the team who scored, where t is the current time (the position of the action in the list of actions, starting from 0). In the case where a player scores in the wrong goal (a red player scores in the red goal, or a blue player scores in the blue goal), you must print the name of the team who wins one point, that is, the other team. 

The events must be printed in ascending order of t.

At the end of the game, you must print the final score as: FINAL SCORE: r b,
where r is the score of the red team and b is the score of the blue team.

Note

In the first example, a blue player goes to the middle of the grid, at the
position of the Quaffle. He takes it, goes to the goal of the red team, and
lets the ball there. He scores! The ball gets back to the middle of the field,
a red player takes it and scores too.

In the second example, the red player takes the Quaffle, move it and throw it.
The blue player catches the ball, goes to the red goal and scores.

In the third example, the red player takes the ball and scores in the goal of
their own team: the blue team wins a point.

    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` is 0, as the loop has completed its execution based on the initial value of `t`. The variable `time` will have reached the value of `t - 1` (the last iteration index). The dictionary `allPlayers` will contain the final state of players, where each key is a player identifier and the value is a boolean indicating whether the player is active (`True`) or inactive (`False`). The list `points` will contain the final scores for each team, with `points[0]` representing the score for Team 0 and `points[1]` representing the score for Team 1. The dictionary `elements` will contain the final positions of all objects, including players and the ball, with each key being an object identifier and the value being a tuple representing the coordinates of the object. The grid `grid` will reflect the final state of the game board, with the positions of players and the ball updated according to the commands executed during the loop.
    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
    #This is printed: FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where [points[0]] is the final score for Team 0 and [points[1]] is the final score for Team 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from standard input to simulate a game. It initializes a grid based on the dimensions `n` and `m`, which are odd integers between 3 and 99. The function processes a series of commands over `t` turns, updating the positions of players and a ball, and managing game events such as scoring goals, catching the golden snitch, and eliminating players. After processing all commands, it prints the final scores for two teams. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints the final state of the game, including the scores and any relevant game events.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: pos is a tuple representing a position on the field, and goal is a list containing two sets, where the first set contains positions of the red team's goals and the second set contains positions of the blue team's goals.
def goalIn(pos):
    res = 0 if pos in goal[0] else 1 if pos in goal[1] else -1
    return res
    #The program returns 0 if `pos` is in the first set of `goal` (red team's goals), 1 if `pos` is in the second set of `goal` (blue team's goals), and -1 otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `goalIn` takes a tuple `pos` representing a position on the field and a list `goal` containing two sets of positions (the first set for the red team's goals and the second set for the blue team's goals). It returns 0 if `pos` is in the red team's goals, 1 if `pos` is in the blue team's goals, and -1 if `pos` is not in either set. The function does not modify any input parameters and only returns one of these three values based on the position provided.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: el is a string of length 2, where the first character is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is a digit (0-9) or 'G'.
def isPlayer(el):
    res = (el[0] == 'B' or el[0] == 'R') and el[1] != 'G'
    return res
    #The program returns True if the first character of `el` is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G'. Otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `isPlayer` accepts a string `el` of length 2, where the first character is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is a digit (0-9) or 'G'. It returns `True` if the first character is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G'. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
