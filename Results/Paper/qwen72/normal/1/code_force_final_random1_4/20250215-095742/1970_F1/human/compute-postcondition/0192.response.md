Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `t` is greater than 0, `time` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` before the update, `nxt` is (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`), `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`. If `obj` is '.B' and `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player, or if `obj` is a player and `nxt` is the position of '.B', then `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is increased by 1. If `isPlayer(obj)` is true, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.
- All other conditions and variables remain as they were in the initial state, including `command`, `obj`, `com`, `t`, `time`, `pos`, `nxt`, `player`, `allPlayers[obj]`, `team`, and `points[team]`.
- The specific updates to `player`, `allPlayers[obj]`, `team`, and `points[team]` depend on the conditions described in the initial state and are only applied if those conditions are met.
