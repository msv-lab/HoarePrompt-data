Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `t` is greater than 0, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]), `allPlayers[obj]` is False, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`**. 

This means that the variable `team` now holds the value returned by the function `goalIn(pos)`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
