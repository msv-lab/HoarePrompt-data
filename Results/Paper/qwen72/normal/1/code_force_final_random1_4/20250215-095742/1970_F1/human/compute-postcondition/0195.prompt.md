Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`. If `com` is ".Q", `allPlayers[obj]` is `True`. If `com` is ".S", `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is incremented by 10. If `com` is neither ".Q" nor ".S", the state remains unchanged. If `len(command) != 3`, an error occurs due to incorrect unpacking, and `pos` and `nxt` are not assigned. If `obj` is equal to ".B" and `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player, `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is increased by 1. If `com` is not 'T' and `isPlayer(obj)` is true, an additional error occurs when attempting to assign `nxt` to `elements[obj]` because `nxt` is not defined. Otherwise, no further assignment is attempted.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `t` is greater than 0. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, and `el` is the third string in `command`. If `el` is equal to '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is `True`. If `el` is equal to '.S', `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' and to 0 otherwise, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `len(command) != 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` before the update, and `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is `.B`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `obj` is `.B` and `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player, or if `obj` is a player and `elements['.B']` is `nxt`, then `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, then `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. If `com` is not 'T' and `isPlayer(obj)` is true, `elements[obj]` is updated to `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `com` is not 'T' and `isPlayer(obj)` is false, `elements[obj]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `t` is greater than 0, `time` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is `True`. If `el` is '.S', `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `len(command) != 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` before the update, and `nxt` is (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`). If `obj` is '.B', `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `obj` is '.B' and `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player, or if `obj` is a player and `nxt` is the position of '.B', then `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is increased by 1. If `isPlayer(obj)` is true, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
