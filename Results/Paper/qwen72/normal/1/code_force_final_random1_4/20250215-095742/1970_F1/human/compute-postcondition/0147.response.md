Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `t` is greater than 0, `obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `el` is the third string in `command`, `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' else `team` is 0, `points[team]` is increased by 10.** 

Explanation: The code increments the value of `points[team]` by 10. The value of `team` depends on whether the first character of `obj` is 'B'. If `obj[0]` is 'B', `team` is 1; otherwise, `team` is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
