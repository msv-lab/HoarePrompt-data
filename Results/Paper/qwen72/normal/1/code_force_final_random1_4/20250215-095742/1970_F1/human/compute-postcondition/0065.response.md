To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and the initial conditions step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `line` is a list of substrings with at least 2 substrings
- `ind` is 2
- `grid` contains `line` as its last element
- `elements` contains a key-value pair where the key is `line[2]` and the value is `(0, 2)`
- If `line[1]` is not equal to '..':
  - `elements` also contains a key-value pair where the key is `line[1]` and the value is `(0, 1)`
- If the first element of `line` is not equal to '..':
  - `elements` also contains a key-value pair where the key is the first element of `line` and the value is `(0, 0)`
- If `line[1]` is a player:
  - `allPlayers` now contains a key-value pair where the key is the first element of `line` and the value is `False`
- If `line[1]` is not a player and the second character of `line[1]` is 'G':
  - `tmp` is 1
  - `goal` now contains a key `1` with a value that is a list containing the tuple `(0, 0)` as its first element
  - `goal` also contains the tuple `(0, 1)` as its second element
- If the first character of `line[1]` is 'B':
  - `tmp` is 0
- Otherwise:
  - `tmp` is 1
- If `line[1]` is equal to '..':
  - The state remains unchanged

### Code:
```python
goal[tmp].append((i, ind))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `tmp`**:
   - If `line[1]` is not a player and the second character of `line[1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 1.
   - If the first character of `line[1]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0.
   - Otherwise, `tmp` is 1.

2. **Determine `goal[tmp]`**:
   - If `tmp` is 1, `goal[1]` is a list that already contains the tuples `(0, 0)` and `(0, 1)`.
   - If `tmp` is 0, `goal[0]` is a list (initially empty).

3. **Append `(i, ind)` to `goal[tmp]`**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `ind` is 2
   - Therefore, `(i, ind)` is `(0, 2)`

### Updated State:
- If `tmp` is 1:
  - `goal[1]` will be updated to contain the tuple `(0, 2)` as its third element.
- If `tmp` is 0:
  - `goal[0]` will be updated to contain the tuple `(0, 2)` as its first element.

### Final Output State:
- If `line[1]` is not a player and the second character of `line[1]` is 'G', or if `line[1]` does not start with 'B':
  - `goal[1]` is `[ (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2) ]`
- If the first character of `line[1]` is 'B':
  - `goal[0]` is `[ (0, 2) ]`

### Output State:
**`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `line` is a list of substrings with at least 2 substrings, `ind` is 2, `grid` contains `line` as its last element, `elements` contains a key-value pair where the key is `line[2]` and the value is `(0, 2)`. If `line[1]` is not equal to '..': `elements` also contains a key-value pair where the key is `line[1]` and the value is `(0, 1)`. If the first element of `line` is not equal to '..': `elements` also contains a key-value pair where the key is the first element of `line` and the value is `(0, 0)`. If `line[1]` is a player, `allPlayers` now contains a key-value pair where the key is the first element of `line` and the value is `False`. If `line[1]` is not a player and the second character of `line[1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 1, and `goal[1]` is `[ (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2) ]`. If the first character of `line[1]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0, and `goal[0]` is `[ (0, 2) ]`. If `line[1]` is equal to '..', the state remains unchanged.**
