Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly initializes the grid, elements, players, and goals based on the input.
   - It reads the dimensions `n` and `m`, and then constructs the grid by reading the next `n` lines.
   - It populates the `elements` dictionary with the positions of all entities (players, goals, and the Quaffle).
   - It initializes the `allPlayers` dictionary to keep track of whether players are carrying the Quaffle.
   - It initializes the `goal` list to store the positions of the goals for each team.
   - It initializes the `points` list to keep track of the scores for each team.

2. **Processing Commands**:
   - The function processes `t` commands, each representing an action in the game.
   - For each command, it updates the positions of entities and handles actions like moving, catching, and throwing the Quaffle.
   - It correctly checks if a player is moving to a position where the Quaffle is and updates the `allPlayers` dictionary accordingly.
   - It correctly handles the scoring logic by checking if a player is at a goal and printing the appropriate message and updating the score.
   - It correctly resets the Quaffle's position to the center of the field after a goal is scored.

3. **Helper Functions**:
   - The `goalIn` function correctly determines if a position is a goal for the red or blue team.
   - The `isPlayer` function correctly identifies if an entity is a player.

4. **Final Output**:
   - After processing all commands, the function prints the final score in the required format.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as players moving out of bounds, catching the Quaffle when not in the same cell, and throwing the Quaffle when not carrying it, as mentioned in the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the rules and requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
