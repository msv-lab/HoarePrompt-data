The code snippet `goal[tmp].append((i, ind))` appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list located at the index `tmp` in the `goal` dictionary.

- `i` is 1
- `ind` is 0
- `tmp` is 1

So, the tuple `(1, 0)` is appended to the list `goal[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `line` is the list of substrings read from standard input and must have at least 1 element, `ind` is 0, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` contains key-value pairs for non-'..' substrings in the new `line`, including the first element of `line` mapped to `(1, 0)`, `allPlayers` contains key-value pairs for player substrings in the new `line`, `goal` contains lists of tuples for substrings ending in 'G' in the new `line`, `tmp` is 1, the first element of `line` (i.e., `line[0]`) is not equal to '..', the element at index `ind` in `line` is not a player substring, and the second character of the element at index `ind` in `line` is 'G', `goal[1]` now includes the tuple `(1, 0)`.**
