The code snippet `grid.append(line)` adds the list `line` to the end of the list `grid`. Since `line` is a list of substrings from the input line, `grid` will now contain one more element, which is the list `line`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `line` is a list of substrings from the input line, `grid` contains `line` as its last element.**
