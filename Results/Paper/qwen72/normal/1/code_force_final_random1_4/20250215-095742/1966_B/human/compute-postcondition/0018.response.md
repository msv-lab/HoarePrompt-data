The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `m` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `m` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the integer provided by the user input, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` user input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is 1. If the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the first string in `gr`, or the first character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the last string in `gr`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.**
