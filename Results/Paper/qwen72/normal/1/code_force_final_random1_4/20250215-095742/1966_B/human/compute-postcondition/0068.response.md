Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the first integer provided by the user input, `m` is the second integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input from each iteration of the loop), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is 'YES', the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`. If any of the conditions `gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]` were true for any `j` in the range `[0, m-2]`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range `[0, m-2]`, so after all iterations, `j` will be `m-2`.
- The variable `impossible` is set to `False` if any of the conditions `gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]` are true for any `j` in the range `[0, m-2]`. If none of these conditions are met during the loop, `impossible` remains `True`.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
