The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the problem description, it is implied that the function accepts input related to multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid defined by its dimensions and the colors of its cells. Specifically, the function processes a series of test cases where each test case includes:

- An integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - Two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of the grid.
  - A grid represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters ('W' or 'B').

The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, but typically, such functions would process the grid and return some result based on the configuration of 'W' and 'B' cells.

Given the lack of specific output details, I will assume the function processes the grids and returns a result for each test case. The exact nature of the result is not clear from the provided information, so I'll describe the general functionality:

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a grid of dimensions n x m with cells colored 'W' or 'B'. It returns a result for each test case based on the configuration of the grid cells.**
