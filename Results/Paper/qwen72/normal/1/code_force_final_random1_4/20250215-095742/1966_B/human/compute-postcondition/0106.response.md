To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and conditions specified in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for j in range(m - 1):
```

This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `j`: This is the loop variable.
   - `m`: This is the upper bound for the loop.

2. **Current State:**
   - `j` is `m - 2`.
   - `m` must be greater than 1.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The loop will execute again if `j < m - 1`.

4. **New State Calculation:**
   - Increment `j` by 1: `j = (m - 2) + 1 = m - 1`.
   - Check the condition: `j < m - 1` becomes `m - 1 < m - 1`, which is false. Therefore, the loop will not execute again.

However, since the loop will not execute again, we need to ensure that the state reflects the final iteration where `j` is `m - 1`.

### Final State:
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `tc` is 2.
- `n` is the first integer provided by the new user input.
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a user input.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `j` is `m - 1`.
- `ans` is 'YES'.
- The first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`.
- If `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.

State: **`t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer provided by the new user input, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a user input, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 'YES', the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`. If `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.**
