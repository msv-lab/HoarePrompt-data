The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input, splits them, and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. This updates the values of `n` and `m` to the new values provided by the user.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the first integer provided by the user input, `m` is the second integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` user input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.**
