The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `m - 1`. If `j` is less than `m - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `m` is the second integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `m` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the first integer provided by the user input, `m` is the second integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input from each iteration of the loop), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is 1, `ans` is 'YES', the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`. If `gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is False, and either the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first sublist in `gr`, or the first element of the last sublist in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the last sublist in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.**
