The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i_prev + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i_prev + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `i_prev + 2`.

State: **`i` is `i_prev + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i_prev + 2`, `gr` is a list with one additional element appended, which is the user input.**
