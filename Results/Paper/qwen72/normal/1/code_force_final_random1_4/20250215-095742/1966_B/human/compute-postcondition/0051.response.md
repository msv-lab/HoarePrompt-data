The code snippet `gr.append(input())` adds a new element to the list `gr`. This new element is the result of the `input()` function, which waits for user input and returns it as a string.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `tc` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `m` is the second integer provided by the user input
- `gr` is a list containing one element which is the user input
- `i` is 1
- `j` is `m-2`
- if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'

After executing the code snippet:
- `gr` now contains two elements: the original user input and the new user input.

The values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the second integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing two elements (the first being the initial user input and the second being the new user input), `i` is 1, `j` is `m-2`, if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.**
