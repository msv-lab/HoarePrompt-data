Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the integer provided by the user input, `m` is greater than 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` user input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is 2. If the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the first string in `gr`, or the first character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the last string in `gr`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.***
