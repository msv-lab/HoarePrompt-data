The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0, as this is the initial state for the loop counter in Python's `range()` function.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` are integers provided by the user input, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
