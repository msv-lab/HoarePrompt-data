Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is the integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` user input strings, `i` is 2, `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is False.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `impossible` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions and values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `j`, and `ans` are still valid and unchanged.
