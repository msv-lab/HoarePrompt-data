Output State: **After all iterations, `t` is the original value provided by the user, `tc` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the grid for the last test case, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings representing the grid for the last test case, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in the loop for each test case. For each test case, if the top-left cell (`gr[0][0]`) is different from the bottom-right cell (`gr[n-1][m-1]`), and all cells in the first row and last row are the same, and all cells in the first column and last column are the same, then `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES'.**

This means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `tc` will have the value `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration. The variables `n` and `m` will hold the dimensions of the grid for the last test case, and `gr` will contain the grid for the last test case. The variables `i` and `j` will be set to `n - 1` and `m - 2` respectively, reflecting the last indices used in the loop. The variable `ans` will hold the result ('YES' or 'NO') for the last test case based on the conditions checked within the loop.
