Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the second integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input from each iteration of the loop), `i` is 0, `j` is `m-2`, the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, `impossible` is False, and `ans` is 'NO'. Additionally, either the first element of the first sublist in `gr` (`gr[i][0]`) is not equal to the first element of the next sublist in `gr` (`gr[i + 1][0]`), or the last element of the first sublist in `gr` (`gr[i][m - 1]`) is not equal to the last element of the next sublist in `gr` (`gr[i + 1][m - 1]`).**
