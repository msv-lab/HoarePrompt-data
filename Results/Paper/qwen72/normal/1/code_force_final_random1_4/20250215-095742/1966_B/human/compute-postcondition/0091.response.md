Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer provided by the new user input, `m` is the second integer provided by the new user input, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, if the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a user input from each iteration of the loop.
- The code snippet `gr = []` reassigns `gr` to an empty list.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
- Since `gr` is now an empty list, any conditions involving elements of `gr` (such as the condition for `ans`) are no longer applicable until `gr` is populated with sublists.
