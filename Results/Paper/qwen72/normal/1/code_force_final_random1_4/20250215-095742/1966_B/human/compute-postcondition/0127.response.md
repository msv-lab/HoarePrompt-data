Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer provided by the new user input and must be greater than 1, `m` is the second integer provided by the new user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a user input, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`. If any of the conditions `gr[k][0] != gr[k + 1][0]` or `gr[k][m - 1] != gr[k + 1][m - 1]` for `k` from 0 to `n - 2` were true, then `impossible` is `False` and `ans` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True` and `ans` is 'NO'.**
