Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer provided by the new user input, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a user input, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 'YES', the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`. If `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `impossible` to `False`. Since no other variables are modified by this code, all other conditions and values from the initial state remain unchanged. The only change is that `impossible` is now explicitly set to `False`.
