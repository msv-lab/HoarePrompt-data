Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the first integer provided by the user input, `m` is the second integer provided by the user input, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    gr.append(input())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing one element which is the user input, `i` is 0, `j` is `m-2`, if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the second integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing two elements (the first being the initial user input and the second being the new user input), `i` is 1, `j` is `m-2`, if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is the second integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing three elements (the first being the initial user input, the second being the new user input, and the third being the latest user input), `i` is 2, `j` is `m-2`, if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
