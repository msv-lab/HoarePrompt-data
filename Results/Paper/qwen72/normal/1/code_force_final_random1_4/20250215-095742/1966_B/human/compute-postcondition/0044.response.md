Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `tc` is 0.
- `n` is an integer provided by the user input.
- `m` is an integer provided by the user input.
- `gr` is a list containing `n` user input strings.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `j` is `m-2`.
- If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, `ans` remains 'NO'.
- Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
1. **User Input:**
   - `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user.
   - `gr` is a list of `n` strings, where each string is provided by the user.

2. **Indices:**
   - `i` is `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `gr`.
   - `j` is `m-2`, which is the second-to-last index of the strings in `gr`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition checks if the first character of the first string (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string (`gr[n-1][m-1]`).
   - If they are not equal, `ans` is set to 'NO'.
   - If they are equal, `ans` is set to 'YES'.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans` based on the condition checked.

### Final Output:
- If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, the output will be 'NO'.
- If `gr[0][0]` is equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, the output will be 'YES'.

Output: **ans (where ans is 'NO' if gr[0][0] is not equal to gr[n-1][m-1], otherwise 'YES')**
