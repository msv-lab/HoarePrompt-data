Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It modifies the `path_ba` list to contain the sequence of predecessors from `b` to the root vertex (indicated by `-1`). It also updates the `ops` list based on the length of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`. If the length of `path_ba` is even and at least 9, `ops` contains tuples `(c2 - 1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each valid index `i`. The function returns `None`.**
