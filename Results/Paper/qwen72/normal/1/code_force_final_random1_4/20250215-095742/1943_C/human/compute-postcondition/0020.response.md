Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains unchanged, `_` is `n-2`, `u` and `v` are the last integers read from the input and each decreased by 1, and `u2vs` is a list of lists where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`_`**: The loop runs `n-1` times, so the value of `_` will be `n-2` after the last iteration (since `_` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each time).
- **`u` and `v`**: These variables are updated in each iteration to the next pair of integers read from the input, each decreased by 1. After the last iteration, they will hold the values of the last pair of integers read.
- **`u2vs`**: This list of lists is populated such that each sublist `u2vs[i]` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `i`. Each connection is bidirectional, meaning if vertex `u` is connected to vertex `v`, both `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` will contain the index of the other vertex.
