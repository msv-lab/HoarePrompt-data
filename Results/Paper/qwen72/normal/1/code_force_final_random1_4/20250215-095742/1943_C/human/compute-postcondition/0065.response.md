Output State: **`path_ba` is a list with a length of at least 9, `i` is 5, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `n` is `-1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c2 - 1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c2 - 1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c2 - 1, 5)`, and `(c2, 5)`, and the variables `_`, `u`, `v`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values.**

Explanation: The tuple `(c2, i)` is appended to the list `ops`. Since `i` is 5, the new tuple added is `(c2, 5)`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
