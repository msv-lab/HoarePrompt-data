Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `_` is a placeholder, `u` is decreased by 2, `v` is an integer from the input decreased by 2, `u2vs[u]` now contains `v` as an additional element, `u2vs[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element, `u` and `v` are now integers from the input split by spaces, `u2vs[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element (duplicated).**

Explanation:
- The line `u2vs[v].append(u)` adds `u` to the list `u2vs[v]`.
- Since `u2vs[v]` already contained `u` as an additional element, it now contains `u` twice.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
