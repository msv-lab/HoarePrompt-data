Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `_` is 1, `u` and `v` are now integers from the input split by spaces, `u2vs[u]` now contains `v` as an additional element, `u2vs[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element (duplicated), `u` and `v` are updated to the new integers from the input.**

Explanation:
- The code `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to `u` and `v`.
- The initial state indicates that `u` and `v` were already integers from the input, but this code updates them to new integers from the input.
- The other conditions in the initial state remain unchanged, including `n` being greater than 2, `_` being 1, and the lists `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` containing the elements as described.
