Output State: **`n` is `previous[previous[b]]`, `n` is `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, if `n` is `-1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `_` is the second value returned by `bfs(0)`, `u` and `v` are the last integers read from the input and each decreased by 1, `u2vs` is a list of lists where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex, `d` is the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and `previous[b]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
