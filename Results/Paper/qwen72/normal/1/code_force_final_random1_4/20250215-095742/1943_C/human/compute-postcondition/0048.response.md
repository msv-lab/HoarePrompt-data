The code snippet `ops.append((c, i))` appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `ci` must be at least 0, but `c` and `ops` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, assuming `ops` is a list and `c` is a variable that holds a value (since it's being used in the tuple), the output state reflects the updated list `ops` with the new tuple added.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `ci` must be at least 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(c, 0)`**
