The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and constructs a tree represented by a list of lists `u2vs`, where each sublist contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) twice to find two specific vertices `a` and `b`. The function constructs a path `path_ba` from `b` to the root vertex (indicated by `-1`). Based on the length of `path_ba`, it generates a list `ops` of operations. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`, where `c` is the middle vertex of the path. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each valid index `i`, where `c1` and `c2` are the two middle vertices of the path. The function prints the length of `ops` and the contents of `ops` in a specific format, and returns `None`.
