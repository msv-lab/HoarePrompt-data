Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the input integer, `u2vs` is a list of empty lists, where the length of the list is equal to `n`. Each element in `u2vs` is an empty list representing the neighbors of a vertex in the tree.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n - 1):
    u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    u -= 1
    v -= 1
    u2vs[u].append(v)
    u2vs[v].append(u)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `u2vs[u]` now contains `v` as an additional element, `u2vs[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 2, `_` is a placeholder, `u` is decreased by 2, `v` is an integer from the input decreased by 2, `u2vs[u]` now contains `v` as an additional element, `u2vs[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element, `u` and `v` are now integers from the input split by spaces, `u2vs[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element (duplicated).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 2, `_` is 1, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is an integer from the input minus 1, `u2vs[u]` now contains `v` as an additional element (duplicated), `u2vs[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element, `u` and `v` are updated to the new integers from the input, `u2vs[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element (duplicated).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
