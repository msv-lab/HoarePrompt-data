Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `_` is the second value returned by `bfs(0)`, `u` and `v` are the last integers read from the input and each decreased by 1, `u2vs` is a list of lists where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex, `d` is the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`**

Explanation:
- The code `b = func_1(d)` assigns the result of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`.
- Since `d` was previously set to the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, and `a` was set to the result of `func_1(d)`, the value of `b` will be the same as `a`.
- All other variables (`n`, `_`, `u`, `v`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`) remain unchanged.
