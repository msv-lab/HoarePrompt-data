Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` remains unchanged, `_` is the second value returned by `bfs(0)`, `u` and `v` are the last integers read from the input and each decreased by 1, `u2vs` is a list of lists where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex, `d` is the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is `previous[b]`. If `n` is `-1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `_` is the second value returned by `bfs(0)`, `u` and `v` are the last integers read from the input and each decreased by 1, `u2vs` is a list of lists where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex, `d` is the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and `previous[b]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is `previous[previous[b]]` and `n` is `previous[path_ba[-1]]`. If `n` is `-1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `path_ba` now includes the value of `n` at its end, and the variables `_`, `u`, `v`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`, and `path_ba` retain their original values and relationships as described in the precondition.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `path_ba` now includes the value of `n` at its end, and the variables `_`, `u`, `v`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`, and `path_ba` retain their original values and relationships as described in the precondition. If `n` is `-1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
