Functionality: ** The function reads a series of inputs to construct a tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges. It then determines the winner of a game played on this tree, starting from a specified node `u_1`. The game alternates between two players, Hermione and Ron, moving along the edges of the tree. The function prints 'Hermione' if the total number of moves made by both players is even, and 'Ron' if the total number of moves is odd. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
