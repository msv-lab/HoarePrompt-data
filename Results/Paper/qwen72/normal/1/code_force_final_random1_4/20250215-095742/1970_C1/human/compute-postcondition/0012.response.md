Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `x` is greater than 1 but decreased by 1, `lst[a]` now includes `b` as an additional element (appended), `rev[b]` now includes `a` as an additional element (appended twice), and the other variables (`n`, `u_1`, `y`, `rev`) remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers provided by the user.
- The value of `x` remains greater than 1 but is decreased by 1.
- The list `lst[a]` now includes `b` as an additional element.
- The list `rev[b]` now includes `a` as an additional element, appended twice.
- The other variables (`n`, `u_1`, `y`, `rev`) remain unchanged.
