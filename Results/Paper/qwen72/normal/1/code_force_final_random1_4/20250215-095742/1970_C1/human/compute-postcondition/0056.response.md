Output State: **The `start` and `target` remain integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. The `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for each unvisited neighbor of the nodes that have been processed, but it may now be empty if all nodes have been processed. The `visited` set contains the integer `start`, all its unvisited neighbors, and all other nodes that have been processed. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns the distance (`dist`) which represents the shortest path length from the starting node (`start`) to the current node being processed in the tree. Otherwise, `current` is the last node processed, and `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `queue` will either be empty (if all nodes have been processed) or contain tuples for any remaining unvisited neighbors. The `visited` set will include all nodes that have been processed, including the starting node and its neighbors. If the `target` node has been reached, the loop will return the shortest path distance from `start` to `target`. If the loop completes without finding the `target`, `current` will be the last node processed, and `dist` will be the distance from `start` to `current`.
