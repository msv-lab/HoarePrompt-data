The code snippet `visited.add(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the `visited` set. This means that the `neighbor` is now marked as visited.

Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for each unvisited neighbor of the nodes that have been processed, but with the first element removed. `visited` set contains the integer `start`, all its unvisited neighbors, all other nodes that have been processed, and now also includes `neighbor`. `current` is now equal to the first element of the tuple that was removed from the `queue`. `dist` is now equal to the second element of the tuple that was removed from the `queue`. `tree[current]` must contain at least one element. `queue` must not be empty.**
