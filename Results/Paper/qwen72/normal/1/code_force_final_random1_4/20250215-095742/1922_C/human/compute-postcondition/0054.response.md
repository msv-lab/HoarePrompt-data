Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` inclusive, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `x` and `y` are updated to the new integers provided by user input. If the new `y` > new `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`. If the new `y` ≤ new `x`, then `y` is less than or equal to `x`.**
