Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[2] = l[1] - l[0] + 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0, and the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged.
- The list `l` remains a list of integers read from input.
- The dictionary `d1` now has an additional key-value pair: `d1[2]` is updated to `l[1] - l[0] + 1`.
- The dictionary `d2` remains a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0.
- The condition that the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` remains valid.
