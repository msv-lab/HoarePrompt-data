Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1`, and `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0. If the difference between the second element of `l` and the first element of `l` is less than the difference between the first element of `l` and the element before it (which is undefined because `i - 1` is out of bounds, but the condition is still true), then no changes are made to `d1` or `d2`. Otherwise, `d1[2]` is updated to `l[1] - l[0] + 1`.***
