Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers read from input.
- `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` inclusive.
- `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0.
- `d2[n - 1]` is set to 1.
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `j` is 1.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input.
- If `y` > `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`.
- If `y` ≤ `x`, then `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(d2[y] - d2[x])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Default Values in `d2`**:
   - `d2` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0.
   - `d2[n - 1]` is explicitly set to 1.

2. **Values of `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input.
   - The relationship between `x` and `y` is given: if `y` > `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`; if `y` ≤ `x`, then `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

3. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - **Case 1**: If `y` is equal to `n - 1` and `x` is not equal to `n - 1`:
     - `d2[y]` will be 1 (since `d2[n - 1]` is set to 1).
     - `d2[x]` will be 0 (since `x` is not `n - 1` and the default value is 0).
     - Therefore, `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `1 - 0 = 1`.

   - **Case 2**: If `y` is not equal to `n - 1` and `x` is not equal to `n - 1`:
     - Both `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` will be 0 (since the default value is 0).
     - Therefore, `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `0 - 0 = 0`.

   - **Case 3**: If `y` is equal to `n - 1` and `x` is also equal to `n - 1`:
     - Both `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` will be 1.
     - Therefore, `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `1 - 1 = 0`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the given conditions and the behavior of the defaultdict, the output will depend on the values of `x` and `y`:
- If `y` is `n - 1` and `x` is not `n - 1`, the output will be 1.
- Otherwise, the output will be 0.

### Final Output:
Output: **0 or 1 (where 1 is printed if y is n - 1 and x is not n - 1, otherwise 0 is printed)**
