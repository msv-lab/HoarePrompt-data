Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `n` must be at least 5, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` inclusive, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. If the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is less than the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`, then `d2[n - 2]` is 2. Otherwise, `d2[n - 3]` is set to `l[n - 3] - l[n - 4] + d2[n - 2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.
- The initial state of `d2` remains unchanged except for the value of `d2[i]` which is now `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.
- The conditions for setting `d2[n - 2]` and `d2[n - 3]` remain as specified in the initial state.
