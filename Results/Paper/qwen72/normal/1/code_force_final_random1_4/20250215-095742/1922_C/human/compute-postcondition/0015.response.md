Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers read from input, and `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0. If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[3] = 2`. Otherwise, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[3] = l[2] - l[1] + 1`.***
