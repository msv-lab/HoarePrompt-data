Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers read from input, and `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0. If `l[3] - l[2] < l[2] - l[1]`, then `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1`, `d1[3] = 2`, and `d1[4] = 3`. Otherwise, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1`, `d1[3] = l[2] - l[1] + 1`, and `d1[4] = 2 + l[2] - l[1]` if the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]` is true. If the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]` is false, then `d1[4] = l[3] - l[2] + 2` if `l[3] - l[2] < l[2] - l[1]`, otherwise `d1[4] = l[3] - l[2] + (l[2] - l[1] + 1)`.***
