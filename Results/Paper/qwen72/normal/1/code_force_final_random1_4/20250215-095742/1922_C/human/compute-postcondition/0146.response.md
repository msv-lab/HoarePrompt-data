Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the input integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d1[2]` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2[n-1]` is 1, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` updates the value of `d2[i]`.
- `i` is `n-4`, so `d2[n-4]` is updated to `l[n-4] - l[n-5] + d2[n-3]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
