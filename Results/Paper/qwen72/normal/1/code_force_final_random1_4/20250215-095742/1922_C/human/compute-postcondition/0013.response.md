The code snippet updates the value of `d1` at the key `i + 2`. Given that `i` is 1, the key becomes `1 + 2`, which is 3. The value assigned to `d1[3]` is `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Since `i` is 1, `i + 1` is 2, and `d1[2]` is 1. Therefore, `1 + d1[2]` is `1 + 1`, which equals 2. Thus, `d1[3]` is set to 2.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged. `i` is still 1, `n` is still greater than 2, `l` is still a list of integers read from input, and `d2` is still a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[3] = 2`, and `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0.**
