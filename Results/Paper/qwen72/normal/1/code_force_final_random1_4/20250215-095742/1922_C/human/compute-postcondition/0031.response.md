Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 3`, `n` must be at least 4, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` inclusive, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is 1. If the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is less than the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`, then `d2[n - 2]` is 2. Otherwise, `d2[n - 3]` is set to `l[n - 3] - l[n - 4] + d2[n - 2]`.***
