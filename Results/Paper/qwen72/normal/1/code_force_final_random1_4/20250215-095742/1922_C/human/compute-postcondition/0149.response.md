Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the new input integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d1[2]` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, and `d2[n-1]` is 1. The values of `d2` from index 1 to `n-2` are updated based on the conditions within the loop.**
