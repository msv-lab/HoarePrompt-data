To determine what will be printed by the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `1`.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to `2`.
   - `l` is a list of integers.
   - `m` must be greater than `1`.
   - `d1` is `0`.
   - `j` is `1`.
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user.
   - If `y` > `x`, the condition `y > x` holds true.
   - If `y` ≤ `x`, the condition `y` ≤ `x` holds true.

2. **Variables Involved in the Print Statement:**
   - `d2` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, it is referenced in the print statement as `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Since `d2` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact values.
   - The print statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` will attempt to subtract the value of `d2[x]` from `d2[y]`.

Given that `d2` is not defined, we cannot compute the exact numerical result of `d2[y] - d2[x]`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] and d2[x] are the values of d2 at indices y and x, respectively)**
