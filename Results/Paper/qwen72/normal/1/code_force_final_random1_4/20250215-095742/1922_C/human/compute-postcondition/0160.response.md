To determine what will be printed by the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `d1` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0.
- `d1[2]` is 1.
- `j` is `m`.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user.
- `d2` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0.
- `d2[n-1]` is 1.

### Analysis:
- `d2` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0. This means that if a key does not exist in `d2`, it will return 0.
- `d2[n-1]` is explicitly set to 1. This means that `d2[n-1]` will always be 1.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user. We need to consider their values in relation to `d2`.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If `x == n-1` and `y == n-1`:**
   - `d2[x]` will be 1.
   - `d2[y]` will be 1.
   - `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `1 - 1 = 0`.

2. **If `x == n-1` and `y != n-1`:**
   - `d2[x]` will be 1.
   - `d2[y]` will be 0 (since `y` is not `n-1`).
   - `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `0 - 1 = -1`.

3. **If `x != n-1` and `y == n-1`:**
   - `d2[x]` will be 0 (since `x` is not `n-1`).
   - `d2[y]` will be 1.
   - `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `1 - 0 = 1`.

4. **If `x != n-1` and `y != n-1`:**
   - `d2[x]` will be 0.
   - `d2[y]` will be 0.
   - `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `0 - 0 = 0`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement depends on the values of `x` and `y`:
- If `x == n-1` and `y == n-1`, the output will be 0.
- If `x == n-1` and `y != n-1`, the output will be -1.
- If `x != n-1` and `y == n-1`, the output will be 1.
- If `x != n-1` and `y != n-1`, the output will be 0.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can only describe the possible outputs based on the conditions.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] is 1 if y == n-1, otherwise 0, and d2[x] is 1 if x == n-1, otherwise 0)**
