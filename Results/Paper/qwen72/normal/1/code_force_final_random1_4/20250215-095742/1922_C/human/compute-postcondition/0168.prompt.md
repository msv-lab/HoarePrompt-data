Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and queries is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. Additionally, for each city, the closest city is unique, and the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    d1 = defaultdict(int)
    d2 = defaultdict(int)
    d1[2] = 1
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
            d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
        else:
            d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]
    d2[n - 1] = 1
    for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
        if l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]:
            d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]
        else:
            d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]
    m = int(input())
    for j in range(m):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        if y > x:
            print(d1[y] - d1[x])
        else:
            print(d2[y] - d2[x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` inclusive, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by user input. If the last `y` > last `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`. If the last `y` ≤ last `x`, then `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `l` is a list of integers, `m` is the input integer, `d1` is 0, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user. If `y` > `x`, the condition `y > x` holds true. If `y` ≤ `x`, the condition `y` ≤ `x` holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `j` is `m`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, and `d2[n-1]` is 1. Regardless of the values of `x` and `y` provided during each iteration, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
