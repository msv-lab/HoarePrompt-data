Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers. For each iteration, if `4 * n - 2 == k`, the relationship `4 * n - 2 == k` held true and the output was `k // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, the relationship `(4 * n - 2) != k` held true and the output was `ceil(k / 2)`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, and after all iterations, `t` will be 0 because the loop has completed its execution.
- For each iteration, the values of `n` and `k` are taken as input integers.
- If the condition `4 * n - 2 == k` is true, the output is `k // 2 + 1`.
- If the condition `4 * n - 2 == k` is false, the output is `ceil(k / 2)`.
- This process repeats for each of the `t` iterations, and after all iterations, the loop terminates with `t` being 0.
