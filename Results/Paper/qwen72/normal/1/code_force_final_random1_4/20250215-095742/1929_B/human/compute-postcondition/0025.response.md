To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `s` is the content of the fourth line.
   - `n` is the first integer from splitting `s`.
   - `k` is the second integer from splitting `s`.

2. **Conditions for `k`:**
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, then `k` retains this value.
   - If `k` is greater than `4 * n - 4`, then `k` retains its original value unless it is specifically `4 * n - 3` or `4 * n - 2`, in which case `k` also retains these values.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet is `print(2 * n - 1)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Extracting `n` and `k` from `s`:**
   - `s` is split into two integers, `n` and `k`.

2. **Evaluating the Condition for `k`:**
   - The condition for `k` is checked, but it does not affect the value of `n`.

3. **Calculating the Value to Print:**
   - The expression `2 * n - 1` is evaluated.
   - Since `n` is the first integer from splitting `s`, the value of `2 * n - 1` depends directly on `n`.

### Final Output:

The `print` statement will output the value of `2 * n - 1`, where `n` is the first integer from splitting the string `s`.

Output: **2 * n - 1 (where n is the first integer from splitting the string s)**
