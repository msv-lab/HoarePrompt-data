To determine what will be printed by the `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value).
- `n` and `k` are new input integers.
- If `4 * n - 2 == k`, the relationship `4 * n - 2 == k` holds true.
- Otherwise, the relationship `(4 * n - 2) != k` holds true.

### Code:
```python
print(ceil(k / 2))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `k` is an integer input.
   - The relationship `4 * n - 2 == k` or `(4 * n - 2) != k` is determined based on the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Expression Evaluation:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `ceil(k / 2)`.
   - `ceil` is a function from the `math` module that rounds up to the nearest integer.

3. **Possible Values of `k`:**
   - If `4 * n - 2 == k`, then `k` is an even number minus 2, which means `k` is an even number.
   - If `(4 * n - 2) != k`, then `k` can be any integer that does not satisfy the equation `4 * n - 2`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - For any integer `k`, `k / 2` will be a float.
   - `ceil(k / 2)` will round this float up to the nearest integer.

### Conclusion:
- If `k` is an even number, `k / 2` will be an integer, and `ceil(k / 2)` will be `k / 2`.
- If `k` is an odd number, `k / 2` will be a float, and `ceil(k / 2)` will be the next integer greater than `k / 2`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where ceil(k / 2) is the ceiling of k divided by 2)**
