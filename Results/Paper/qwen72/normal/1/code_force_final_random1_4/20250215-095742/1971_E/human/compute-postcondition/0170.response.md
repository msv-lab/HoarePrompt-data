Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `l` is 0.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `m` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `ql` is an input integer.
- `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain sorted order.
- The element at index `s` in the list `a` is equal to `ql`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[s], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: This list is assumed to be sorted. The variable `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in `a` to maintain the sorted order, and it is given that `a[s] == ql`.

2. **List `b`**: The problem does not provide any information about the list `b`. We need to assume that `b` is a list that has at least `s + 1` elements, otherwise accessing `b[s]` would result in an `IndexError`.

3. **Print Statement**: The statement `print(b[s], end=' ')` will print the element at index `s` of the list `b` followed by a space.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `b`.

Output: **b[s] (where b[s] is the element at index s in the list b)**
