Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` has at least `len(a)` elements, all other variables (`b`, `bd`, `ad`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `ql`, `m`, `s`, and `_`) remain unchanged, `v` is now `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-2] / bd[len(a)-2]]`, `l` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `m` is now `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`, `ql` is now `ql - a[s - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` to its current value.
- The value of `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
