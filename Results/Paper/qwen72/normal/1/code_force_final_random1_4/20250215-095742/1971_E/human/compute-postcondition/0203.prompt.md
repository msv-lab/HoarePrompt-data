Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and q are integers where k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 10^5, representing the final destination, the number of known time points, and the number of queries, respectively. a is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, with a_k = n. b is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1. Each query d is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ n. The sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    ad = [0]
    bd = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
    v = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
    for l in range(q):
        m = 0
        i = 1
        ql = int(input())
        s = bisect_left(a, ql)
        if a[s] == ql:
            print(b[s], end=' ')
            continue
        ql -= a[s - 1]
        m += b[s - 1]
        m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
        print(int(m), end=' ')
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `ql` will be the last value of `ql - a[s - 1]` computed during the final iteration, `m` will be the last value of `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` computed during the final iteration, `l` will be equal to `q`, and `i` will be 1. The variable `s` will be the index where the final `ql` would be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. If `a[s]` equals the final `ql`, the loop would have continued to the next iteration or the next statement outside the loop. The lists `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, and `v` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is 1, `a` has at least `len(a)` elements, `b`, `bd`, `ad`, `n`, `k`, `q`, and `_` remain unchanged, `v` is now `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-2] / bd[len(a)-2]]`, `l` is `q - 1`, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` for each iteration, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql` for each iteration, and `ql` is the value of `int(input()) - a[s - 1]` for the last iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `l` is `q - 1`, `q` is the total number of iterations, `m` is the final calculated value based on the last `ql` input, `i` is 1, `ql` is the last input value minus the appropriate `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where the last `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. The conditions and calculations for `m`, `ql`, and `s` are consistent with the logic described in the loop for each iteration. The variables `a`, `ad`, `b`, `bd`, and `v` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
