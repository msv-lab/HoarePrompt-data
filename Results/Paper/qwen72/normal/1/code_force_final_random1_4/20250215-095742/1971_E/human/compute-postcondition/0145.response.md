Output State: **`i` is 2, `a` must have at least three elements, `ad` contains the values `[a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1]]`**. 

Explanation: The code appends the difference between the third element (`a[2]`) and the second element (`a[1]`) of the list `a` to the list `ad`. Since `ad` initially contained the value `a[1] - a[0]`, after the execution, `ad` now contains both `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[2] - a[1]`. The values of `i` and the requirement that `a` must have at least three elements remain unchanged.
