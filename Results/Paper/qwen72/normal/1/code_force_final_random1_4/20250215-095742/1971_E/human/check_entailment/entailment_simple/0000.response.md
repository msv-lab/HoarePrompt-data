### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It reads `n`, `k`, and `q` for each test case, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The lists `a` and `b` are prefixed with a 0 to handle the starting point (0, 0).
   - The lists `ad` and `bd` are initialized to store the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - The list `v` is initialized to store the speeds between consecutive points.

3. **Speed Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the distances `ad` and times `bd` between consecutive points.
   - The speeds `v` are calculated as the ratio of distances to times.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `ql`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment in which `ql` lies.
   - If `ql` is exactly at a known point, the corresponding time is directly printed.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the time taken to reach `ql` by adding the time taken to reach the previous known point and the additional time to travel the remaining distance within the segment.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `ql` is exactly at a known point.
   - The program correctly rounds down the time to the nearest integer using `int(m)`.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of `bisect_left` ensures efficient lookup of the segment containing `ql`.
   - The program processes each query in logarithmic time relative to the number of known points, making it efficient for large inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and efficiently processes the queries.

Correctness: **True**
