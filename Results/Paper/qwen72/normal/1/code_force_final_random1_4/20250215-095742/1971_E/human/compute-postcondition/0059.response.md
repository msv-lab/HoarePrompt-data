Output State: **`ql` is an input integer, `m` is 0, `l` is `l + 1`, `q` must be greater than `l + 1`, `i` is 1, and `s` is the index where the new `ql` would be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order.**

Explanation: The `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module is used to find the insertion point for `ql` in the sorted list `a`. This insertion point is stored in the variable `s`. The other variables (`ql`, `m`, `l`, `q`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The condition that `q` must be greater than `l + 1` also remains valid.
