The code snippet appends the difference between the second element (`a[1]`) and the first element (`a[0]`) of the list `a` to the list `ad`. Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` refers to the second element of `a`, and `a[i - 1]` refers to the first element of `a`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` must have at least two elements, `ad` contains the value `a[1] - a[0]`**.
