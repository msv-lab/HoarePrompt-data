To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation of `m` step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ql` is defined as `ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - `m` is defined as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.
   - `l` is incremented by 1 (`l = l + 1`).
   - `q` must be greater than `l + 1`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is the index where the new `ql` would be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a`, `b`, `ad`, and `bd` are lists, but their specific values are not provided.
   - `ql` is computed based on the previous value of `ql` and the element `a[s - 1]`.
   - `m` is computed using the elements from the lists `b`, `bd`, `a`, and `ad` at the index `s`.

3. **Computation of `m`:**
   - `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - `m` is then calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer part of `m` followed by a space.

Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for the lists `a`, `b`, `ad`, and `bd`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m`. However, we can describe the process and the expected output format.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s], and ql is updated to ql - a[s - 1])**
