Output State: **`i` is 3, `a` must have at least four elements, `ad` contains the values `[a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], a[3] - a[2]]`**. 

The code appends the difference between the fourth element and the third element of list `a` to the list `ad`. The values of `i` and the requirement that `a` must have at least four elements remain unchanged.
