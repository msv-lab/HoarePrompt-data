The only variable in the loop head is `l`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `l` relative to `q`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 and `q` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `q` must still be greater than `l`.

State: **`l` is 2, `q` is greater than 2, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. If the element at index `s` in the list `a` is equal to `ql`, then the condition `a[s] == ql` holds true, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
