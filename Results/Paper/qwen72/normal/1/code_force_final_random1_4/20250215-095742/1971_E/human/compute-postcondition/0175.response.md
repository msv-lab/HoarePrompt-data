Output State: **`l` is 0, `q` is greater than 0, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. If the element at index `s` in the list `a` is equal to `ql`, then the condition `a[s] == ql` holds true.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * ql / ad[s]` to its current value, which was `b[s - 1]`.
- The value of `ql` is already given as `ql - a[s - 1]` in the initial state, so it remains unchanged.
- All other variables (`l`, `q`, `i`, `s`) remain the same as in the initial state.
