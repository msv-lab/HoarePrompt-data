Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input, `ad` is a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a` (i.e., `a[i] - a[i-1]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a)-1`), `bd` is a list containing only the integer 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `ad` is a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing the integers 0 and `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a) + 1` elements, `ad` is a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing the integers 0 and `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `i` is `len(a)`, `bd` now contains one additional element which is `b[len(a)] - b[len(a) - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `len(a) + 1`, `bd` is updated to include the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i-1]` (i.e., `b[len(a) + 1] - b[len(a)]`), while `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `ad`, and the requirement that `b` must have at least `len(a) + 2` elements remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
