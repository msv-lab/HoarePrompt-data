To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `ql` is an input integer.
- `m` is 0.
- `l` is `l + 1` (which implies `l` is incremented by 1).
- `q` must be greater than `l + 1`.
- `i` is 1.
- `s` is the index where the new `ql` would be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[s], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `s`:**
   - `s` is the index where the new `ql` would be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. This means `s` is determined by the position of `ql` in the sorted list `a`.

2. **Understanding `b[s]`:**
   - `b` is a list, but it is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we need to infer its content from the context.
   - Since `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in `a`, `b[s]` refers to the element in `b` at the same index as where `ql` would be inserted in `a`.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `b[s]` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `b[s]`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **b[s] (where b[s] is the element in the list b at the index where ql would be inserted in the list a to maintain sorted order)**
