Output State: **`i` is `len(a) + 1`, `a` has `len(a)` elements, `ad` contains the values `[a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `b` must have at least `len(a) + 2` elements, `bd` now contains the values `[previous bd values, b[len(a) - 1] - b[len(a) - 2], b[len(a)] - b[len(a) - 1], b[len(a) + 1] - b[len(a)], b[len(a) + 1] - b[len(a)]]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains `len(a) + 1`.
- The list `a` still has `len(a)` elements.
- The list `ad` remains unchanged and still contains the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
- The list `b` still has at least `len(a) + 2` elements.
- The list `bd` is updated by appending the difference `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, which is `b[len(a) + 1] - b[len(a)]`. Therefore, `bd` now includes the new value `b[len(a) + 1] - b[len(a)]` in addition to its previous values.
