Output State: **`b` must have at least 4 elements, `bd` has four additional elements which are the differences between `b[3]` and `b[2]`, `b[2]` and `b[1]`, `b[1]` and `b[0]`, and `b[3]` and `b[2]`, `i` is 3.** 

Explanation: The code appends the difference between `b[3]` and `b[2]` to the list `bd`. Since `i` is 3, the new element added to `bd` is `b[3] - b[2]`. The initial state specified that `bd` already had three elements representing the differences between consecutive elements of `b` up to `b[2]` and `b[1]`. Now, `bd` has one more element, making it four additional elements in total. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3.
