To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant calculations step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `a` has at least `len(a)` elements.
- `b`, `bd`, `ad`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `l` is 2.
- `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-2] / bd[len(a)-2]]`.
- `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.
- `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`.
- `ql` is now `ql - a[s - 1]`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `s`:**
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`.
   - Since `ql` is initially 2, `s` will be the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to 2.

2. **Update `ql`:**
   - After finding `s`, `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - If `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to 2, then `a[s - 1]` is the element just before `s` in the list `a`.

3. **Calculate `m`:**
   - `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.
   - We need the values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `a[s - 1]`, `ad[s]`, and the updated `ql`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following values for simplicity:
- `a = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `b = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `bd = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `ad = [1, 2, 3, 4]`

1. **Determine `s`:**
   - The first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to 2 is `2` at index 1.
   - So, `s = 1`.

2. **Update `ql`:**
   - `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - Since `s = 1`, `a[s - 1] = a[0] = 1`.
   - Therefore, `ql = 2 - 1 = 1`.

3. **Calculate `m`:**
   - `m = b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.
   - Substituting the values:
     - `b[s - 1] = b[0] = 1`
     - `bd[s] = bd[1] = 2`
     - `a[s - 1] = a[0] = 1`
     - `ad[s] = ad[1] = 2`
     - `ql = 1`
   - Therefore, `m = 1 + 2 * (1 - 1) / 2 = 1 + 2 * 0 / 2 = 1 + 0 = 1`.

### Final Output:
The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer value of `m` followed by a space.

Output: **1**
