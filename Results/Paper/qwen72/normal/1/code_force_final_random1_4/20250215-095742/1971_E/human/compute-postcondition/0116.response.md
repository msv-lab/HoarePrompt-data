Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` has at least `len(a)` elements, all other variables (`b`, `bd`, `ad`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `m`, `s`, and `_`) remain unchanged, `v` is now `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-2] / bd[len(a)-2]]`, `l` is 1, `q` must be greater than 0, `m` is now `0`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`, `ql` is now `int(input()) - a[s - 1]`, and the program continues to the next iteration or statement.**
