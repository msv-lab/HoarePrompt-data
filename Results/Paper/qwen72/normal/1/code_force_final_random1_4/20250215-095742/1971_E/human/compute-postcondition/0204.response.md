The function `func` accepts no direct parameters but is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer (k ≤ n ≤ 10^9) representing the final destination.
  - `k`: An integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) representing the number of known time points.
  - `q`: An integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5) representing the number of queries.
  - `a`: A list of k integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, with a_k = n) representing the positions at known time points.
  - `b`: A list of k integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1) representing the times at known positions.
  - `d`: A list of q integers (0 ≤ d ≤ n) representing the queries.

The function processes each test case and for each query `d` in the list of queries, it returns the time corresponding to the position `d` based on the known positions and times provided in lists `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the final destination `n`, the number of known time points `k`, the number of queries `q`, the lists of known positions `a` and times `b`, and the list of queries `d`. For each query `d`, the function returns the time corresponding to the position `d` based on the known positions and times.**
