Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `b` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `bd` is `[0]`, `ad` is `[0]`, `k` and `_` remain unchanged, `v` is now `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-2] / bd[len(a)-2]]`, `l` is `q - 1`, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` for each iteration, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql` for each iteration, and `ql` is the value of `int(input()) - a[s - 1]` for the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `bd = [0]` reassigns the variable `bd` to a new list containing only the value `0`.
- All other variables (`i`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `k`, `_`, `v`, `l`, `m`, `s`, `ql`, `n`, `q`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
