Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by a final destination `n`, the number of known time points `k`, the number of queries `q`, and two lists `a` and `b` representing known positions and times, respectively. For each query `d`, the function calculates and prints the time corresponding to the position `d` based on the known positions and times. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, and `v` unchanged, while the internal variables used for calculations (`l`, `m`, `i`, `ql`, `s`) are reset or updated for each test case. **
