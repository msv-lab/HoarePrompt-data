Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` has at least `len(a)` elements, `b`, `bd`, `ad`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `l` is 2, `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-2] / bd[len(a)-2]]`, `m` is `b[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`, `ql` is now `ql - a[s - 1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated by adding the value of `b[s - 1]` to its current value (which was 0). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
