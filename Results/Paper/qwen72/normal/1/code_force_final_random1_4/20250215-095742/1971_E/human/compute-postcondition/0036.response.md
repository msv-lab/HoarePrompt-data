To determine what will be printed by the `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements.
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements.
- `ad` is a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
- `bd` is a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`.
- `i` is 1.
- `v` is a list containing the elements [0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]].
- `l` is 0.
- `m` is 0.
- `ql` is an input integer.
- `s` is the index in the list `a` where `ql` should be inserted to maintain sorted order, and `a[s]` is equal to `ql`.

### Explanation:
1. **Lists `a` and `b`:**
   - `a` is a list starting with 0 and followed by a sequence of integers.
   - `b` is a list starting with 0 and followed by a sequence of integers, with at least as many elements as `a`.

2. **Lists `ad` and `bd`:**
   - `ad` contains the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
   - `bd` contains the differences between consecutive elements of `b`.

3. **List `v`:**
   - `v` is a list containing the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`.

4. **Variable `s`:**
   - `s` is the index in the list `a` where `ql` should be inserted to maintain sorted order, and `a[s]` is equal to `ql`.

### What is printed:
- The `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement will print the element at index `s` in the list `b`.

### Final Output:
Since `s` is the index in the list `a` where `ql` should be inserted to maintain sorted order, and `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the value of `b[s]` is the corresponding element in the list `b` at the same index.

Output: **b[s] (where s is the index in the list a where ql should be inserted to maintain sorted order, and a[s] is equal to ql)**
