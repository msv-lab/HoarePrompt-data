The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. This means that no changes are made to the variables, and the program continues from the top of the loop.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `q` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain sorted order, and the element at index `s` in the list `a` is equal to `ql`.**
