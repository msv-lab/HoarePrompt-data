To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`
- `a` has `len(a)` elements
- `ad` contains the values `[a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `range(1, len(b))` generates at least one value. This means `len(b)` must be greater than 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: The initial value of `i` is `len(a) - 1`, but this value is not relevant to the loop head. The loop will set `i` to values from 1 to `len(b) - 1`.
- **`b`**: For the loop to execute, `b` must have at least 2 elements (i.e., `len(b) > 1`).

### Final State:
The state before the loop starts should ensure that the loop can execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `b` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`i` is `len(a) - 1`, `a` has `len(a)` elements, `ad` contains the values `[a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `b` must have at least 2 elements**
