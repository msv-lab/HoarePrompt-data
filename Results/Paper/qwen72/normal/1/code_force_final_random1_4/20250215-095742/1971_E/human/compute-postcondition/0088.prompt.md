Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ad` is a list starting with 0 and now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `a` up to the last element of `a`. The list `a` remains unchanged and starts with 0 followed by the integers from the input. The list `b` remains unchanged and starts with 0 followed by the integers from the input. The variables `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers. The variable `ql` will be the last value of `ql - a[s - 1]` computed during the final iteration. The variable `m` will be the last value of `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` computed during the final iteration. The variable `l` will be equal to `q`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `a` minus 1. The variable `s` will be the index where the final `ql` would be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. The lists `a`, `ad`, `bd`, and `v` remain unchanged. The list `bd` is now `[0]`. The variable `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b` must have at least 2 elements, `bd` has one additional element which is the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` must have at least 3 elements, `bd` has two additional elements which are the differences between `b[2]` and `b[1]`, and `b[i]` and `b[i-1]`, `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` must have at least 4 elements, `bd` has four additional elements which are the differences between `b[3]` and `b[2]`, `b[2]` and `b[1]`, `b[1]` and `b[0]`, and `b[3]` and `b[2]`, `i` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
