To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed on the variables:

### Initial State:
- `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `m` is updated to `m + (bd[s] * ql) / ad[s]`.
- `l` is incremented by 1.
- `q` must be greater than the new value of `l`.
- `i` is 1.
- `s` is the index where the new `ql` would be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. If `a[s]` is equal to the new `ql`, the current iteration continues to the next iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Update `ql`**:
   - `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - This means `ql` is reduced by the value at index `s - 1` in the list `a`.

2. **Update `m`**:
   - `m` is updated to `m + (bd[s] * ql) / ad[s]`.
   - Here, `bd[s]` and `ad[s]` are elements from the lists `bd` and `ad` at index `s`.
   - The new value of `m` is the old value of `m` plus the result of the expression `(bd[s] * ql) / ad[s]`.

3. **Increment `l`**:
   - `l` is incremented by 1.

4. **Check `q`**:
   - `q` must be greater than the new value of `l`.
   - This condition ensures that `q` is always greater than `l`.

5. **Determine `s`**:
   - `s` is the index where the new `ql` would be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order.
   - If `a[s]` is equal to the new `ql`, the current iteration continues to the next iteration of the loop.

### Final Output:
The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer part of the updated value of `m`.

Since the exact values of `ql`, `m`, `a`, `bd`, and `ad` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m`. However, based on the operations described, the print statement will output the integer part of the updated value of `m`.

Output: **int(m) (where m is the updated value of m after the operations described in the initial state)**
