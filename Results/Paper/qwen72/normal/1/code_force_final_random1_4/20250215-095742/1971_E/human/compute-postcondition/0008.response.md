To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `q` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input.
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input.
- `ad` is a list containing only the integer 0.
- `bd` is a list containing only the integer 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `len(a)` must be greater than 1.
- The variable `i` starts at 1 and increments up to `len(a) - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The length of the list `a` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
- The variable `i` starts at 1, which is already correct as per the loop statement.

### Final State:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `q` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input, and `len(a)` must be greater than 1.
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input.
- `ad` is a list containing only the integer 0.
- `bd` is a list containing only the integer 0.
- `i` is 1.

### State:
**`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input and `len(a)` must be greater than 1, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input, `ad` is a list containing only the integer 0, `bd` is a list containing only the integer 0, `i` is 1**
