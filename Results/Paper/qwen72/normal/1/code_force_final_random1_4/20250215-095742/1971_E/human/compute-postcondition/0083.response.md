The code snippet appends the difference between the current element `b[i]` and the previous element `b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Since `b` must have at least 2 elements, `i` must be at least 1 for the operation to be valid.

Output State: **`b` must have at least 2 elements, `bd` has one additional element which is the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]`.**
