Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a) + 1` elements, `ad` is a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing the integers 0 and `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `i` is `len(a)`, `bd` now contains one additional element which is `b[len(a)] - b[len(a) - 1]`.**
