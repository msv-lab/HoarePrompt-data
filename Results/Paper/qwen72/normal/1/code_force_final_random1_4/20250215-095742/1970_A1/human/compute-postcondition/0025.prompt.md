You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", with a length not exceeding 500,000, and it is a balanced parentheses sequence.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", with a length not exceeding 500,000, and it is a balanced parentheses sequence; `n` is the length of `s` and does not change; `balance_info` is a list containing `n` elements, each a `BalanceInfo` object. Each `BalanceInfo` object in the list has `balance` set to the cumulative balance up to that index, `index` set to the corresponding index in the string `s`, and `char` set to the character at that index in `s`. The final value of `balance` is 0, as the string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: s (where s is a balanced parentheses sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", with a length not exceeding 500,000, and it is a balanced parentheses sequence. The function processes this string and returns a result based on the balanced parentheses sequence.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
