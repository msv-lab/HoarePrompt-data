### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to perform a balanced shuffle operation on a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The balanced shuffle involves computing the balance of each prefix, sorting the characters based on the balance and position, and then forming a new sequence from the sorted characters.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(infoA, infoB)`**: This function is used to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects. It returns the difference in balances if they are different, otherwise, it returns the difference in positions (in reverse order). This function is used as a custom comparator for sorting.
   - **`func_2(s)`**: This function performs the main logic:
     - It iterates through the string `s`, maintaining a running balance.
     - It creates a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, each containing the balance, position, and character.
     - It sorts the list using the custom comparator defined in `func_1`.
     - It constructs the result string from the sorted list and prints it.

3. **Verification of Logic:**
   - **Balance Calculation:** The balance is correctly calculated by incrementing for '(' and decrementing for ')'.
   - **Sorting:** The sorting is done based on the balance and position as required. The custom comparator ensures that the balance is the primary key and the position is the secondary key (in reverse order).
   - **Result Construction:** The result string is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted list, which should produce the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the constraints of the problem, including the maximum length of 500,000.
   - It correctly processes balanced sequences, ensuring that the output is also a balanced sequence.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. The logic is sound, and the functions work together to produce the expected output.

**Correctness: **True****
