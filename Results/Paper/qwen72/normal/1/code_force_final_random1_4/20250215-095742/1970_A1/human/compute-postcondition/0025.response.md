Functionality: ** The function `func_2` takes a non-empty string `s` consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", with a length not exceeding 500,000, and ensures that `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence. It processes the string to create a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, each containing the cumulative balance, the index, and the character at that index. After sorting this list based on the balance and then by the negative index, it constructs a new string from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects and prints this new string, which is also a balanced parentheses sequence. The function does not return any value. **
