The code snippet `score += l[i]` adds the first element of the list `l` to the variable `score`. Given the initial state, `score` was initially 0, and `i` is 0, so `score` now holds the value of the first element in the list `l`.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is equal to the first element of `l`, `i` is 0**
