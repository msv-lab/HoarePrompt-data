The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `2 * n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a new input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 2 (as specified by the step in the `range` function), and `n` must still be such that `2 * n` is greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` starts at 0 and is incremented by 2, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be 2. For the loop to continue, `2 * n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is equal to the first element of `l`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
