The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `2 * n`. The loop increments `i` by 2 each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is a new input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 2 (so `i` becomes 4), and `n` must still be such that `2 * n` is greater than 4.

State: **`_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is `l[0] + l[2]`, `i` is 4**
