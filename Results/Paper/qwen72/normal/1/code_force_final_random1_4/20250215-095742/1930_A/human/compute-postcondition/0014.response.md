The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer, which is also specified to be greater than 0. The other variables (`_`, `l`, `score`, `i`) remain unchanged. The new value of `n` does not affect the current state of these other variables.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is now equal to the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)th element of `l`, `i` is 2 * n - 2**
