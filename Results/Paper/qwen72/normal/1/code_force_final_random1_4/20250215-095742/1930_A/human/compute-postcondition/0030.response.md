Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is `l[0]`, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code snippet `score += l[i]` adds the first element of the list `l` (which is `l[0]`) to the variable `score`. Since `i` is 0, `l[i]` is `l[0]`. The value of `score` was initially 0, so after the addition, `score` is now equal to the first element of the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
