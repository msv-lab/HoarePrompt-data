Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It processes multiple test cases, reads the number of pairs `n`, and a list of `2n` integers. The key part of the solution is sorting the list of integers and then summing up every second element starting from the first element (index 0). This approach ensures that we always pick the smaller number in each pair, which is optimal for maximizing the score according to the problem's requirements.

The logic of the program is as follows:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number of pairs `n`.
   - Read and sort the list of `2n` integers.
   - Initialize a score variable to 0.
   - Iterate through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from index 0) and adding it to the score.
   - Print the score for the current test case.

This approach is correct because:
- Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are considered first.
- By taking every second element starting from the first, we ensure that we are always picking the smaller number in each pair, which maximizes the score.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
