Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 1 (This variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is a new input integer greater than 0.
- `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input.
- `score` is equal to the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)-th element of `l`.
- `i` is 2 * n - 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(score)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is calculated as `2 * n - 2`.
   - For example, if `n` is 3, then `i` would be `2 * 3 - 2 = 4`.

2. **Determine the elements to sum for `score`:**
   - `score` is the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)-th element of `l`.
   - This means we sum the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., (2 * n - 2) - 2.
   - For example, if `n` is 3, then we sum the elements at indices 0, 2, and 4.

3. **Calculate `score`:**
   - The elements to be summed are `l[0]`, `l[2]`, `l[4]`, ..., `l[2 * n - 4]`.
   - The sum of these elements is stored in `score`.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `n` is 3 and `l` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
  - `i` is `2 * 3 - 2 = 4`.
  - The elements to sum are `l[0]`, `l[2]`, and `l[4]`, which are 1, 3, and 5.
  - Therefore, `score` is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.

### Final Output:
The `print(score)` statement will print the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)-th element of the list `l`.

Output: **score (where score is the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)-th element of the list l)**
