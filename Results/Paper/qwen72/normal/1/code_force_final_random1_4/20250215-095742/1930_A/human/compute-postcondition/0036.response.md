Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 2 (This variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is a new input integer greater than 1.
- `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input.
- `score` is the sum of every second element in `l` starting from index 0 up to the last even index less than `2 * n`.
- `i` is `2 * n - 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(score)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `n`:**
   - `n` is an integer greater than 1. For example, if `n = 3`, then `2 * n = 6`.

2. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is `2 * n - 2`. Using the example where `n = 3`, `i` would be `6 - 2 = 4`.

3. **Determine the value of `score`:**
   - `score` is the sum of every second element in `l` starting from index 0 up to the last even index less than `2 * n`.
   - For example, if `l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` and `n = 3`, then `2 * n = 6`.
   - The elements to consider are from index 0 to index 4 (since 4 is the last even index less than 6).
   - The elements at these indices are `l[0]`, `l[2]`, and `l[4]`, which are `1`, `3`, and `5` respectively.
   - Therefore, `score = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.

### Final Output:
The `print(score)` statement will print the sum of every second element in the list `l` starting from index 0 up to the last even index less than `2 * n`.

Output: **score (where score is the sum of every second element in the list `l` starting from index 0 up to the last even index less than 2 * n)**
