The value of `score` is updated by adding the value of `l[i]` to its current value. Since `i` is 4, `l[i]` refers to the fifth element in the list `l`. The initial value of `score` was the sum of the first and third elements of `l`. After the addition, `score` is now equal to the sum of the first, third, and fifth elements of `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is now equal to the sum of the first, third, and fifth elements of `l`, `i` is 4, `2 * n` must be greater than 4.**
