Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is `l[0] + l[2]`, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code snippet `score += l[i]` updates the value of `score` by adding the value at index `2` of the list `l` to the current value of `score`. Initially, `score` was set to `l[0]`, so after executing the code, `score` becomes `l[0] + l[2]`. The values of `_`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `l` also remains unchanged.
