Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the score by repeatedly selecting two numbers from the list, adding the minimum of the two to the score, and then removing both numbers. This process is repeated `n` times until all numbers are removed.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - It sorts the list of integers in non-decreasing order.
   - It initializes a variable `score` to 0.
   - It iterates over the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adds it to the score. This is because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements will always be paired with the next smallest elements, ensuring that the minimum values are added to the score.
   - Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Sorting**: Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are considered first, which is optimal for maximizing the score.
   - **Pairing**: By taking every second element starting from the first, the program ensures that the minimum value in each pair is added to the score. This is the optimal strategy because the smallest elements will always contribute the most to the score when paired with the next smallest elements.
   - **Loop**: The loop runs `n` times, which is correct since we need to perform the operation `n` times, and each iteration processes two elements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly by simply adding the smallest element to the score.
   - It also handles larger values of `n` correctly by summing up the appropriate elements.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
