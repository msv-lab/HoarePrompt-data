Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is equal to the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)-th element of `l`, `i` is 2 * n - 2**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` is a new input integer greater than 1. The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns a new value to `n` based on user input, which is an integer greater than 1.
- The values of `_`, `l`, `score`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n` while keeping the other variables and their values the same as in the initial state.
