Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is equal to the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)-th element of the new `l`, `i` is 2 * n - 2.**

Explanation:
- The variable `_` remains unchanged and is still 2.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged and is still a new input integer greater than 1.
- The variable `l` is now updated to a sorted list of integers from user input.
- The variable `score` is recalculated based on the new `l`, and it is equal to the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)-th element of the new `l`.
- The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 2 * n - 2.
