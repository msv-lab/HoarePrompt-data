To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0 (This variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input.
   - `score` is now equal to the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)th element of `l`.
   - `i` is 2 * n - 2.

2. **Understanding the Calculation of `score`:**
   - The list `l` is sorted and contains integers.
   - `score` is calculated by summing every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)th element of `l`.
   - This means we take elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., (2 * n - 2).

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `n = 3` and `l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
   - The elements to be summed are at indices 0, 2, and 4.
   - Therefore, `score = l[0] + l[2] + l[4] = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.

4. **General Case:**
   - For any `n`, the elements to be summed are `l[0], l[2], l[4], ..., l[2 * n - 2]`.
   - The value of `score` will be the sum of these elements.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(score)` statement will print the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)th element of the list `l`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **score (where score is the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)th element of the list l)**
