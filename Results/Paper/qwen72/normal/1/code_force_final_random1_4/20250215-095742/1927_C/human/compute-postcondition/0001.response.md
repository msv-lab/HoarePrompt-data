The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into three parts, converting each part to an integer and assigning them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and the input integers must be at least 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer ≥ 1, `m` is an input integer ≥ 1, `k` is an input integer ≥ 1**
