Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer ≥ 1, `m` is an input integer ≥ 1, `k` is an input integer ≥ 1, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `aOnes` is 0.** 

The variable `aOnes` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`) retain their initial values and conditions.
