### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. Each test case includes the lengths of the two arrays `a` and `b`, and the value of `k`.

2. **Initialization**: The variables `aOnes` and `bOnes` are initialized to zero. These variables are used to count how many numbers from 1 to `k` have been found in arrays `a` and `b`, respectively. The variable `newk` is set to `k // 2`, which represents the number of elements that need to be chosen from each array.

3. **Loop Through Numbers 1 to k**:
   - The loop iterates through each number `i` from 1 to `k`.
   - If the number `i` is present in both arrays `a` and `b`, it checks which array has fewer selected elements (`aOnes` or `bOnes`) and increments the appropriate counter.
   - If the number `i` is present only in array `a` and `aOnes` is less than `newk`, it increments `aOnes`.
   - If the number `i` is present only in array `b` and `bOnes` is less than `newk`, it increments `bOnes`.
   - If the number `i` is not found in either array or the respective counter has reached `newk`, the loop breaks.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the function checks if both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`. If they are, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.

### Analysis:
- The logic ensures that the function correctly counts the number of elements from 1 to `k` that can be chosen from each array.
- The condition `if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk` ensures that exactly `k/2` elements are chosen from each array.
- The function handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
