The code snippet `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t + 1`
- `n` is an input integer ≥ 1
- `m` is an input integer ≥ 1
- `k` is an input integer ≥ 1
- `a` is a list of integers read from input
- `b` is a list of integers read from input
- `newk` is `k // 2`
- `i` is `k + 1`
- `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b` and were counted as per the loop conditions, up to a maximum of `newk`
- `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are also in `a` and were counted as per the loop conditions, up to a maximum of `newk`
- If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.

After executing the code snippet, the new values for `n`, `m`, and `k` are read from the input, replacing their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `m` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `k` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b` and were counted as per the loop conditions, up to a maximum of `newk`, `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are also in `a` and were counted as per the loop conditions, up to a maximum of `newk`. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.**
