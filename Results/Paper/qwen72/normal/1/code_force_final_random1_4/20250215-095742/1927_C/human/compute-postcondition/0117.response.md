Output State: **`n` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `m` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `k` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `t` is `t + 2`, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `b` is a new list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `newk` is updated to `k // 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
