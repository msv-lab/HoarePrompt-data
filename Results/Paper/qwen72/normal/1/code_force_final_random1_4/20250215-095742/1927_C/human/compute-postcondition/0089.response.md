Postcondition: ***`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `m` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `k` is a new input integer ≥ 2, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `b` is a new list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, `aOnes` is 0 or 1, and `bOnes` is 0, 1, or 2. If `i` (which is 2) is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0 or 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
