Postcondition: ***`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `m` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `k` is a new input integer ≥ 3, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `b` is a new list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then if `aOnes < bOnes`, `aOnes` is increased by 1; otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is only in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is only in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in neither `a` nor `b`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
