Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m` (the sizes of arrays `a` and `b`), and an even integer `k`. For each test case, it checks if it is possible to select exactly `k/2` unique elements from both arrays `a` and `b` such that each selected element appears in both arrays. If this condition is met, the function prints 'yes' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the results for each test case, and the final state of the program reflects the completion of all test cases. **
