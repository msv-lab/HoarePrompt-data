Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are new input integers â‰¥ 1, `t` is `t + 2`, `a` and `b` are new lists of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0, and either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is greater than `newk`. Additionally, either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`.***
