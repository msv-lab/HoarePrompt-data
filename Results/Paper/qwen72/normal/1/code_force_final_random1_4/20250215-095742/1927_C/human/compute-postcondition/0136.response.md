Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers â‰¥ 1, `t` is `t + 2`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1. If `i` (which is 1) is present in both lists `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` < `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 0. Otherwise, if `i` is present in both lists `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in both lists, `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain 0. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0, and either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is greater than `newk`. Additionally, either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`.***
