#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, and k is an even integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m). Arrays a and b contain n and m integers respectively, where each element a_i and b_j is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        aOnes = 0
        
        bOnes = 0
        
        newk = k // 2
        
        i = 1
        
        while i <= k:
            if i in a and i in b:
                if aOnes < bOnes:
                    aOnes += 1
                else:
                    bOnes += 1
            elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
                aOnes += 1
            elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
                bOnes += 1
            else:
                break
            i += 1
        
        if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:

            print('no')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0 (since it was decremented by the loop's execution, but in reality, it is the number of remaining test cases to process, which is 0 when all test cases are processed), `n`, `m`, and `k` are the last set of inputs processed, `a` and `b` are the last sets of arrays processed, `newk` is `k // 2` for the last iteration, `i` is `k + 1` for the last iteration, `aOnes` and `bOnes` are the final counts of elements in `a` and `b` that meet the conditions specified in the loop for the last iteration. If `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, the output for the last test case is 'yes'; otherwise, it is 'no'. All previous values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` from earlier iterations are no longer relevant.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m` (the sizes of arrays `a` and `b`), and an even integer `k`. For each test case, it checks if it is possible to select exactly `k/2` unique elements from both arrays `a` and `b` such that each selected element appears in both arrays. If this condition is met, the function prints 'yes' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the results for each test case, and the final state of the program reflects the completion of all test cases.
