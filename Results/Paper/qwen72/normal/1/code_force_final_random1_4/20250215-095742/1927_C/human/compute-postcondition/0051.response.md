Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer ≥ 1.
- `m` is an input integer ≥ 1.
- `k` is an input integer ≥ 1.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `b` is a list of integers read from input.
- `newk` is `k // 2`.
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b` and were counted as per the loop conditions, up to a maximum of `newk`.
- `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are also in `a` and were counted as per the loop conditions, up to a maximum of `newk`.
- Additionally, `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`.

Given these conditions, the `print('yes')` statement will always print the string `'yes'` because the conditions for `aOnes` and `bOnes` being equal to `newk` are explicitly stated.

Output: **yes**
