Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer ≥ 1, `m` is an input integer ≥ 1, `k` is an input integer ≥ 1, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in a list `b`. The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged. The new variable `b` is now a list of integers read from the input.
