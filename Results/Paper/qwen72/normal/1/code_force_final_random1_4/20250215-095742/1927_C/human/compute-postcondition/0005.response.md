Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer ≥ 1, `m` is an input integer ≥ 1, `k` is an input integer ≥ 1, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the new variable `bOnes` which is set to 0. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
