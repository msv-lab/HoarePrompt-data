Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `m` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `k` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `t` is `t + 2`, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `b` is a new list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers ≥ 1, `t` is `t + 2`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2. If `i` (which is now 2) is present in both lists `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` < `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 0. Otherwise, if `i` is present in both lists `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in both lists, `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain 0. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0, and either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is greater than `newk`. Additionally, either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers ≥ 1, `t` is `t + 2`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then either `aOnes` is incremented by 1 (if `aOnes < bOnes`) or `bOnes` is incremented by 1 (if `aOnes ≥ bOnes`). If `i` is in `a` but not in `b` and `aOnes ≤ newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a` and `bOnes ≤ newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If none of these conditions are met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers ≥ 1, `t` is `t + 2`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 4, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 3. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then: if `aOnes < bOnes`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is only in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is only in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in either `a` or `b`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
