Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the initial input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `i` is 1, `new` is a list where `new[0]` is `max(a[0], b[0])`, `new2` is a list of `None` with the same length as `a`, `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`, `new2[0]` is `min(a[0], b[0])`.** 

The value of `i` has been incremented from 0 to 1, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
