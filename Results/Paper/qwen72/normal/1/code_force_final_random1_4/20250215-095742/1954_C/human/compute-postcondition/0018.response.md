Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `new` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i] != b[i]` or `i` reaches the end of the list is `max(a[i], b[i])` and the rest are `None` values, `new2` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i] != b[i]` or `i` reaches the end of the list is `min(a[i], b[i])` and the rest are `None` values, `i` is the index where `a[i] != b[i]` or the length of `a` if all elements are equal, and `a[j] == b[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-1`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000.
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- The list `new` will have the maximum value of corresponding elements from `a` and `b` up to the point where they differ or until the end of the list, and the rest of the elements will be `None`.
- The list `new2` will have the minimum value of corresponding elements from `a` and `b` up to the point where they differ or until the end of the list, and the rest of the elements will be `None`.
- The variable `i` will be the index where the elements of `a` and `b` first differ, or the length of `a` if all elements are the same.
- For all indices `j` from 0 to `i-1`, the elements `a[j]` and `b[j]` are equal.
