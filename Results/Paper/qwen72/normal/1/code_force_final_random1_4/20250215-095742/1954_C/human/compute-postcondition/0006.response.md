To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `i`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input.
   - `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input.

3. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - `i < len(a)`: This condition checks if the index `i` is within the bounds of the list `a`.
   - `a[i] == b[i]`: This condition checks if the elements at index `i` in lists `a` and `b` are equal.

4. **Ensuring the First Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions must be true when `i` is 0.
   - `i < len(a)`: Since `i` is 0, this condition will always be true as long as `a` is not an empty list.
   - `a[i] == b[i]`: This condition will be true if the first elements of `a` and `b` are equal.

5. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - `a` and `b` must be non-empty lists.
   - The first elements of `a` and `b` must be equal.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is already 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`. The lists `a` and `b` must be non-empty and their first elements must be equal for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, `i` is 0, and `a[0] == b[0]`**
