Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the initial input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `i` is the index where `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` or `i` is equal to the length of `a`. If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, `new` is a list where each element up to index `i-1` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the remaining elements are `None`. `new2` is a list where each element up to index `i-1` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the remaining elements are `None`. If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new` is a list where each element `new[j]` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`, and `new2` is a list where each element `new2[j]` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.***
