To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is 1.
- `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the initial input.
- `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input.
- `i` is the index where `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` or `i` is equal to the length of `a`.

### Conditions for `new` and `new2`:
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`:
  - `new` is a list where each element up to index `i-1` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the remaining elements are `None`.
  - `new2` is a list where each element up to index `i-1` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the remaining elements are `None`.
- If `i` is equal to the length of `a`:
  - `new` is a list where each element `new[j]` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.
  - `new2` is a list where each element `new2[j]` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine `i`**:
   - `i` is the first index where `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. If no such index exists, `i` is the length of `a`.

2. **Construct `new`**:
   - If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`:
     - For `j` from 0 to `i-1`, `new[j] = max(a[j], b[j])`.
     - For `j` from `i` to the end of the list, `new[j] = None`.
   - If `i` is equal to the length of `a`:
     - For `j` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`, `new[j] = min(a[j], b[j])`.

3. **Print `new`**:
   - The `print` statement joins the elements of `new` into a single string, converting each element to a string. If an element is `None`, it will be converted to the string `'None'`.

### Example Scenarios:
1. **Scenario 1**: `a = [1, 2, 3]`, `b = [1, 2, 4]`
   - `i = 2` (since `a[2] != b[2]`)
   - `new = [max(1, 1), max(2, 2), None] = [1, 2, None]`
   - Output: **12None**

2. **Scenario 2**: `a = [1, 2, 3]`, `b = [1, 2, 3]`
   - `i = 3` (since `a` and `b` are equal up to the end)
   - `new = [min(1, 1), min(2, 2), min(3, 3)] = [1, 2, 3]`
   - Output: **123**

### General Output:
Based on the initial state and the conditions, the output will be a string representation of the list `new` with each element converted to a string. If any element is `None`, it will be represented as `'None'`.

Output: **''.join(str(x) for x in new) (where new is constructed based on the conditions described above)**

For a more precise answer, we need the specific values of `a` and `b` to determine the exact output. However, the general form of the output is as described.
