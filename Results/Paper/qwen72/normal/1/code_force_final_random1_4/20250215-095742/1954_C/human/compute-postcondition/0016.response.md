Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `new` is a list where the first element is `max(a[0], b[0])`, the second element is `max(a[1], b[1])`, the third element is `a[2]` (since `a[2] == b[2]`), and the rest are `None` values, `new2` is a list where the first element is `min(a[0], b[0])`, the second element is `min(a[1], b[1])`, the third element is `a[2]` (since `a[2] == b[2]`), and the rest are `None` values, `i` is 2, `a[0] == b[0]`, `len(a) > 2`, `a[1] == b[1]`, and `a[2] == b[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])` updates the third element of the list `new2` to be the minimum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`.
- Since `a[2] == b[2]`, `min(a[2], b[2])` is simply `a[2]`.
- Therefore, `new2[2]` is now `a[2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
