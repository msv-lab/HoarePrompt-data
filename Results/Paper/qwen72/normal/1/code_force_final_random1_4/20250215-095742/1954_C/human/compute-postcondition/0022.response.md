Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `new` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` or `i-1` reaches the end of the list is `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])` and the rest are `None` values, `new2` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` or `i-1` reaches the end of the list is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])` and the rest are `None` values, `i` is the index where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` or the length of `a` if all elements are equal, and `a[j] == b[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-2`. The value of `new[i-1]` is `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, and the value of `new2[i-1]` is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`.**
