Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `new` is a list where each element is `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`, `new2` is a list where each element is `max(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`, and `i` is equal to `len(a)`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- **`_`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`a` and `b`**: These lists remain unchanged as they are only used for comparison.
- **`new`**: After the loop completes, each element in the `new` list is set to the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
- **`new2`**: After the loop completes, each element in the `new2` list is set to the maximum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
- **`i`**: The index `i` is incremented until it reaches the length of the list `a`, at which point the loop terminates. Therefore, `i` is equal to `len(a)` after the loop finishes.
