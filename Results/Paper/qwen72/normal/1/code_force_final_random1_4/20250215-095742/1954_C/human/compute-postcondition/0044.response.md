Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the initial input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `i` is equal to the length of `a` if the initial input is fully processed, otherwise `i` is the index where `a[i] != b[i]` or the length of `a` if all elements are equal, `new` is a list of `None` with the same length as `a`, `new2` is a list of `None` with the same length as `a`.**
