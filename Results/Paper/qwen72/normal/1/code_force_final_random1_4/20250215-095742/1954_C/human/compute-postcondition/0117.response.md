To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of a new input.
- `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of another new input provided by the user.
- `i` is the index where `a[i]` is no longer equal to `b[i]` or `len(a)` (whichever is smaller).
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`:
  - `new` is a list where each element up to index `i-1` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the rest are `None` values.
  - `new2` is a list where each element up to index `i-1` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the rest are `None` values.
- If `i` is equal to the length of `a`:
  - `new` is a list where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`.
  - `new2` is a list where each element is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `i`:**
   - `i` is the index where `a[i]` is no longer equal to `b[i]` or `len(a)` (whichever is smaller).
   - This means `i` is the first index where the digits differ, or it is the length of `a` if all digits are the same up to the length of the shorter list.

2. **Construct `new2`:**
   - If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`:
     - `new2` contains the minimum of corresponding elements from `a` and `b` up to index `i-1`, and the rest are `None`.
   - If `i` is equal to the length of `a`:
     - `new2` contains the maximum of corresponding elements from `a` and `b` for all indices from 0 to `len(a)-1`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement joins the elements of `new2` into a single string, converting each element to a string.
   - If any element in `new2` is `None`, it will be converted to the string `'None'`.

### Example Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1: `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = [1, 2, 4]`**
  - `i` is 2 because `a[2]` (3) is not equal to `b[2]` (4).
  - `new2` will be `[1, 2, None]`.
  - Output: **12None**

- **Scenario 2: `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = [1, 2, 3]`**
  - `i` is 3 because all elements are the same up to the length of `a`.
  - `new2` will be `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - Output: **123**

### General Output:
Based on the initial state and the logic described, the output will be a string representation of the elements in `new2` up to the point where they are defined (either `min(a[j], b[j])` or `max(a[j], b[j])`), followed by `None` for any undefined elements.

Output: **''.join(str(x) for x in new2) (where new2 is constructed based on the conditions described in the initial state)**

For a more precise output, we need the specific values of `a` and `b` to determine the exact elements of `new2`. However, without those specific values, the general form of the output is as described above.
