Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input provided by the user, `i` is the index where `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` or `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `new2 = [None] * len(a)` initializes `new2` as a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`. This overrides the previous definition of `new2` which had specific values up to index `i-1` and `None` for the rest. Now, `new2` is simply a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
