Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input provided by the user, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new` is a list where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`, and `new2` is a list where each element is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`.
- In each iteration, the loop updates the `i`-th element of `new` to be the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and the `i`-th element of `new2` to be the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to the length of `a`, meaning that all elements of `a` and `b` have been processed.
- The `new` list will contain the minimum value of `a[j]` and `b[j]` for each index `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`.
- The `new2` list will contain the maximum value of `a[j]` and `b[j]` for each index `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`.
- The variables `t` and `_` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
