To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `i < len(a)`. This condition checks if the index `i` is within the bounds of the list `a`.

### Current State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `_` is 0
- `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input
- `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input
- `new` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` or `i-1` reaches the end of the list is `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])` and the rest are `None` values
- `new2` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` or `i-1` reaches the end of the list is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])` and the rest are `None` values
- `i` is the index where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` and `i` is now `i + 1`
- `a[j] == b[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-2`
- The value of `new[i-1]` is `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`
- The value of `new2[i-1]` is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`
- The value of `new[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`
- The value of `new2[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`

### Analysis:
- The loop condition `i < len(a)` must be true for the loop to execute one more time.
- The current state indicates that `i` has been incremented by 1, and we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `len(a)`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since `i` is already incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `len(a)`.
- No other adjustments are necessary because the loop condition only depends on `i` and `len(a)`.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute one more time as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`. Therefore, the state remains the same.
