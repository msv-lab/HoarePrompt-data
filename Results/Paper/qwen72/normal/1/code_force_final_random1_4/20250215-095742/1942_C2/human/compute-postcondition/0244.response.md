The code snippet `odd.append(gap)` appends the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. Given the initial state, `gap` is calculated as `next_elem - a[1] - 1`. Since `next_elem` is `a[1]`, `gap` simplifies to `a[1] - a[1] - 1`, which is `-1`. However, the initial state specifies that if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` list contains `gap`. Since `-1` does not satisfy this condition, the initial state's condition for appending to `odd` is not met. However, the code snippet explicitly appends `gap` to `odd`, regardless of its value.

Therefore, the value `-1` is appended to the `odd` list. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is greater than 1, `next_elem` is `a[1]`, `gap` is `-1`, `odd` contains `-1`, if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` list contains `gap`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` contains the value of `gap`. Otherwise, `even` remains unchanged.**
