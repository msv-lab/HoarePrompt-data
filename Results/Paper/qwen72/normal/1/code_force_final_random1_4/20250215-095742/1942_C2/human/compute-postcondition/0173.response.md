Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + gap + 2 * y`, `n`, `a`, `st`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `odd`, `even` is now sorted in ascending order, `y` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `y` to 0. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
