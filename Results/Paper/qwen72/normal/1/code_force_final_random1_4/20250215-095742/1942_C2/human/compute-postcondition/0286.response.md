Postcondition: ***`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the last element of `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order) with at least one element, `y` is `y - sum(gap // 2 for gap in odd)`, `ans` is `ans + sum(odd) + 2 * min(y, gap // 2 for gap in odd)`. If `y < gap // 2`, then `y` is set to 0, `ans` is updated to `ans + sum(odd) + 4 * y`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
