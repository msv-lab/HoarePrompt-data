The provided Python code snippet updates the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` based on user input. Here's the step-by-step impact:

1. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input.
2. The initial state specifies that `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input, which means these variables will now hold the new values.
3. The other variables (`t`, `tt`, `ii`, `a`, `i`, `ans`, `tmp`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the user input and must have at least `x` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations of the loop plus the value of `y`, `tmp` contains the values added during the loop execution.**
