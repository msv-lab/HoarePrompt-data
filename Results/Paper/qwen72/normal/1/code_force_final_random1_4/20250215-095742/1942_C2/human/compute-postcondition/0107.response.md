The value of `y` is decremented by `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`. This means the new value of `y` is `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is now `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is now `x + y - 1` or `x + y - 2` plus `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` is now a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.**
