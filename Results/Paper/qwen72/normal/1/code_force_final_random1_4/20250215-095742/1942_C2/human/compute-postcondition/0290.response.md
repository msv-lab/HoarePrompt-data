Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `even`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order) with at least one element, `y` is `y - gap // 2` (or 0 if `y < gap // 2` after the decrement), `ans` is updated to `ans + sum(odd) + 4 * y + 2 * y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by `2 * y`.
- All other variables (`i`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, `even`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
