Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ans` is either `x + y - 1` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, or `x + y - 2` if the difference is not 2. If the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]` is even and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + (a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, `tmp` is a list containing the integer `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, and `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x + y - 2`, `tmp` remains an empty list, and `y` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2, then `ans` is updated to `x + y` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, or `x + y - 1 + (a[1] - a[0]) // 2` if the difference is even and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, or `x + y - 1` otherwise. `tmp` is a list containing the integer `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` if the conditions for updating `ans` were met, or an empty list otherwise, and `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)` if the conditions for updating `ans` were met, or remains unchanged otherwise. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not 2, then if the difference is even and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + (a[1] - a[0]) // 2 + (a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, `tmp` is a list containing the integers `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` and `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, and `y` is updated to `y - ((a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x + y - 2`, `tmp` remains an empty list, and `y` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)`, `tmp` is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`, and `ans` is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. If none of these conditions are met, no changes are made to `y`, `tmp`, or `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
