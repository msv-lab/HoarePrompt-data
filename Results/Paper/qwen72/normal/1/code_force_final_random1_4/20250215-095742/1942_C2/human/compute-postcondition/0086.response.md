The only variable in the loop head is `ii`, and the loop condition is based on `ii` being less than `tt`. At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is 1 and `tt` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` needs to be incremented by 1, and `tt` must still be greater than the new value of `ii`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the final value of `x + y - 2` plus the sum of all increments due to the loop conditions plus the current value of `y`, `tmp` is a list containing all the integers added during the loop execution plus the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.**
