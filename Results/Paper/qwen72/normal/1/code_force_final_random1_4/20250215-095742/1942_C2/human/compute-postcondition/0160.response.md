The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function accepts multiple parameters. Specifically, it seems to accept a series of test cases, each defined by the parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`, along with a list of `x` distinct integers.

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer with the constraint 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
  - `x` is an integer with the constraint 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5).
  - `y` is an integer with the constraint 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x.
  - The second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the given parameters and the list of `x` distinct integers. However, the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the given parameters and the list of integers.**
