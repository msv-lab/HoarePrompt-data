Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ans` is either `x + y - 1` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, or `x + y - 2` if the difference is not 2. If the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]` is even and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + (a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, `tmp` is a list containing the integer `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, and `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x + y - 2`, `tmp` remains an empty list, and `y` remains unchanged.***
