Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + sum(odd) + gap + 2 * (y - (gap // 2))`, `n`, `a`, `st`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the second element of `even`, `odd` is a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `even` is a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `y` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `y` to 0.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
