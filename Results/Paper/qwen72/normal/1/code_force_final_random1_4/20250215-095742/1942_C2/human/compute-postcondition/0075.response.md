Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the final value of `x + y - 2` plus the sum of all increments due to the loop conditions, `tmp` is a list containing all the integers added during the loop execution, and `y` is the final value after being decremented according to the loop conditions. Additionally, the difference between the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is exactly 2.**
