Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the final value of `x + y - 2` plus the sum of all increments due to the loop conditions. If the expression `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2` evaluates to 0 and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is incremented by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` is a list containing all the integers added during the loop execution plus the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is decremented by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, `tmp` remains the same, and `y` remains unchanged. The sum of the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is not equal to 2.***
