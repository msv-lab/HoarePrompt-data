Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the user input and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ans` is 1 if `a[1] - a[0] == 2`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `y` is updated based on the conditions described, `tmp` now contains one element which is `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.**
