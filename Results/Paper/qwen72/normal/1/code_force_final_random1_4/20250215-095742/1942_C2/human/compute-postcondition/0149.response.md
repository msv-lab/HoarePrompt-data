Output State: **`val` is sorted such that odd numbers come before even numbers, and within each group, numbers are sorted in ascending order, and `val` must contain at least two elements; `i` is the next element in `val` after the current `i`; `c` is the integer part of the new `i` divided by 2; `y` is updated to `y - c`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is calculated as the integer part of `i` divided by 2.
- The value of `y` is updated to `y - c`.
- The conditions for updating `sx` and breaking out of the loop are not met yet, so `sx` remains unchanged.
- All other conditions and values from the initial state remain valid.
