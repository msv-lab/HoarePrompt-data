The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `a` (though it is not used in the function) and a string `s`. The function counts the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' within `s` and prints the sum of these counts. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the sum of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' for each test case. The function does not return any value.
