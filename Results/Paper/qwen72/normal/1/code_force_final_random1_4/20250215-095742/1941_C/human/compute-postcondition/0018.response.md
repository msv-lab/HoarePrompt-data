Output State: **_ is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`. This state repeats for each of the `t` test cases, with `a` and `s` being re-initialized for each iteration. After all iterations, the loop has printed the sum of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' for each test case.**
