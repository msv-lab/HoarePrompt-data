Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is equal to `t`**. 

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is specified to be equal to `t`. The initial state of `t` being an integer within the range 1 to 10^4 remains unchanged, and the placeholder `_` is not affected by the code.
