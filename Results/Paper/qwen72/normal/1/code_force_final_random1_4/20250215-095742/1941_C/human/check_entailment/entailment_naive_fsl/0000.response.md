Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program only counts the occurrences of the exact substrings "map" and "pie" and sums them up. However, the problem requires removing the minimum number of characters to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring in the resulting string.

Here is a counterexample:
- Input: `s = "mappie"`
- Expected Output: `3` (by removing the characters to make the string "mae")
- Program Output: `2` (it only counts the substrings "map" and "pie" and sums them)

The program fails to consider the minimum number of deletions required to avoid these substrings, which is a critical part of the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
