Reasoning:

The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that can be encoded to a given integer `n`. The logic in the program is based on the following observations:

1. **Case for `n > 52`:**
   - If `n` is greater than 52, the largest possible sum of indices for a three-letter word is 78 (i.e., `z + z + z` which is `26 + 26 + 26`). Therefore, for `n > 52`, the word must start with a letter whose index is `n - 52` (since the remaining two letters are both `z` which contribute 52 to the sum). This is correctly handled by the line `word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.

2. **Case for `26 < n ≤ 52`:**
   - If `n` is between 27 and 52, the word must start with `a` (index 1) and the second letter must be such that the sum of its index and 26 (from the third letter `z`) equals `n - 1`. This is correctly handled by the line `word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.

3. **Case for `n ≤ 26`:**
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 26, the word must consist of two `a`s (each contributing 1 to the sum) and a third letter whose index is `n - 2`. This is correctly handled by the line `word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

Each case is correctly identified and the corresponding word is constructed and printed. The program handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the given constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
