#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78), representing the encoded value of a three-letter word. The function should return or print the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded to the given `n`.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: `i` is equal to the number of test cases provided minus 1, each `n` has been an input integer corresponding to each test case, and for each `n`, `word` was determined as follows: If `n` > 52, `word` is the character at index `n - 53` from the `alphabet` list followed by `'zz'`. If `n` > 26 and `n` ≤ 52, `word` is `'a'` followed by the character at index `n - 28` from the `alphabet` list and then `'z'`. If `n` ≤ 26, `word` is `'aa'` followed by the character at index `n - 3` from the `alphabet` list. Each `word` was printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78). For each `n`, the function determines and prints the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded to `n`. Specifically, if `n` > 52, the word is the character at index `n - 53` from the lowercase English alphabet followed by 'zz'. If 26 < `n` ≤ 52, the word is 'a' followed by the character at index `n - 28` and then 'z'. If `n` ≤ 26, the word is 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3`. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
