Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78), representing the encoded value of a three-letter word. The function should return or print the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded to the given `n`.

Code Snippet:
```python
alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. The code snippet assigns the value of `string.ascii_lowercase` to the variable `alphabet`.
2. `string.ascii_lowercase` is a predefined string in Python that contains all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
3. The assignment does not affect any other variables or the overall state of the function `func`.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78), representing the encoded value of a three-letter word. The function should return or print the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded to the given `n`. `alphabet` is set to 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.**
