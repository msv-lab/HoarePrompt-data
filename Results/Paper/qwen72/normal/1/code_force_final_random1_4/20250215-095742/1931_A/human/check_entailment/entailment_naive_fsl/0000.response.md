Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic used to construct the lexicographically smallest word is flawed. Hereâ€™s a specific case where the program fails:

- **Input**: `n = 48`
- **Expected Output**: `auz`
- **Actual Output**: `aa{` (which is incorrect because `{` is not a valid lowercase Latin letter)

The program incorrectly constructs the word by adding fixed offsets to the alphabet indices without properly considering the constraints of the problem. For example, when `n = 48`, the program constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[48 - 3]`, which results in an invalid character. The correct approach should ensure that the constructed word is always a valid combination of three lowercase letters.
