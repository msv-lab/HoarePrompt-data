Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` remains unchanged at 2.
- The variable `n` remains an input integer greater than 2.
- The variable `word` is updated by concatenating the character at index `n - 53` from the `alphabet` string with the string `'zz'`. Therefore, `word` now holds the value `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
