The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This operation updates the values of `x` and `y` based on the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2` or `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` if `m` is less than `a`, and `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`.**
