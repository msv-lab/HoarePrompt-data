The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from user input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This operation updates the values of `x` and `y` based on the input provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `i`, `z`, and `m`) are not directly affected by this code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`. If `m` < `a`, then `z` is updated to `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - 15 * ((y + 1) // 2) + y * 4 + 15 - 1) // 15`, and `m` remains `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`. Otherwise, `z` and `m` retain their original values.**
