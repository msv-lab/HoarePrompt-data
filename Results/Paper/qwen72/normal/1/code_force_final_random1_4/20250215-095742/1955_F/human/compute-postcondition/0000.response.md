To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `_` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The variable `_` is a placeholder used in the loop and does not affect the loop's execution condition.
2. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must return a positive integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `p_i` are four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence, respectively.

The loop will execute if `int(input())` returns a value greater than 0. Since `t` is already defined as an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, it implies that `int(input())` should be equal to `t` for the loop to execute the correct number of times.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` returns a value greater than 0, which is consistent with the given range of `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `p_i` are four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence, respectively, and `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0**.
