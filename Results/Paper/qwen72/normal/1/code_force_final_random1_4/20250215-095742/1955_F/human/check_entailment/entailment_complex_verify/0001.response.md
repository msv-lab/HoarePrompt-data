### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is zero.
   - The sequence consists of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the initial counts of these numbers are given.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s and 3s (since 1 and 3 are odd, and 2 and 4 are even) is even.
   - Removing a number changes the parity of the counts, which affects the XOR result.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It then applies a transformation to make the counts even by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2.
   - The expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if the number of odd counts among 1s, 2s, and 3s is exactly 3.
   - The expression `sum(p) // 2` calculates half the sum of the even counts.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The transformation `int(x) - int(x) % 2` ensures that the counts are made even.
   - The condition `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if there are exactly three odd counts among the first three elements (1s, 2s, 3s). However, this condition is not relevant to the problem because we are only interested in the counts of 1s and 3s.
   - The final result is the sum of the above condition and half the sum of the even counts. This part of the logic is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the parity of 1s and 3s.

5. **Verification:**
   - The logic in the function does not correctly handle the parity of 1s and 3s, which is crucial for determining the maximum number of times Bob can win.
   - The examples provided in the problem statement are not correctly handled by the function.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect based on the problem description and the provided examples.

Final: **False**
