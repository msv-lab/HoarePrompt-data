Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` is a list of four integers where 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, `a` is a non-empty list of integers provided by user input, `cnt` is 1 + the sum of math.floor(x / 2) for each element `x` in `a` if `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]` and `a[0] % 2 == 1`, otherwise `cnt` is the sum of math.floor(x / 2) for each element `x` in `a`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `p_i` also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `a` is a non-empty list of integers provided by user input, and it remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `cnt` is updated in each iteration of the loop by adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to its current value, where `x` is the current element of `a`.
- If the initial condition `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]` and `a[0] % 2 == 1` is true, `cnt` starts with a value of 1. Otherwise, `cnt` starts with a value of 0.
- After all iterations of the loop, `cnt` will be the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in `a`, plus 1 if the initial condition was met.
