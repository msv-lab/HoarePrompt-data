Let's break down the given code and initial state step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `p` is a list of four even integers derived from the input, where each element is the nearest even number less than or equal to the corresponding `p_i` value.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding `p`**:
   - `p` is a list of four even integers. Since each element of `p` is even, the expression `x % 2 > 0` will always evaluate to `False` for any element `x` in `p`.

2. **Map and Sum**:
   - `map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])` applies the lambda function to the first three elements of `p`. Since all elements of `p` are even, the result of the lambda function for each element will be `False`.
   - `list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))` will produce a list of three `False` values: `[False, False, False]`.
   - `sum([False, False, False])` will sum these boolean values. In Python, `False` is equivalent to `0` and `True` is equivalent to `1`. Therefore, the sum will be `0`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if the sum of the boolean values is 3. Since the sum is `0`, this condition evaluates to `False`.

4. **Sum of `p`**:
   - `sum(p)` calculates the sum of all four elements in the list `p`.
   - Since `p` contains even integers, the sum of these integers will also be even.

5. **Integer Division**:
   - `sum(p) // 2` performs integer division of the sum of `p` by 2. This will yield an integer result.

6. **Final Expression**:
   - The final expression is `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2`.
   - Since the condition `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` is `False`, it evaluates to `0`.
   - Therefore, the expression simplifies to `0 + sum(p) // 2`, which is just `sum(p) // 2`.

### Conclusion:
The code will print the integer result of `sum(p) // 2`.

Output: **sum(p) // 2 (where sum(p) is the sum of the four even integers in the list p)**
