You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, p_i are four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `p` is a list of four even integers derived from the input, where each element is the nearest even number less than or equal to the corresponding input value. The loop prints the result of the expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads four integers representing counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. It then processes these counts to ensure they are even numbers and calculates a specific value based on the counts. The function prints the result of this calculation for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is zero.
   - The sequence consists of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the initial counts of these numbers are given.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 3s, and the total count of numbers are even.
   - Removing a number changes the parity of the counts, which affects the XOR result.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It then applies a transformation to make the counts even by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2.
   - The expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if the number of odd counts among 1s, 2s, and 3s is exactly 3.
   - The expression `sum(p) // 2` calculates half the sum of the even counts.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The transformation `int(x) - int(x) % 2` ensures that the counts are made even.
   - The condition `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if there are exactly three odd counts among the first three elements (1s, 2s, 3s).
   - The final result is the sum of the above condition and half the sum of the even counts.

5. **Verification:**
   - The logic correctly handles the parity and ensures that Bob wins as many times as possible by removing numbers optimally.
   - The examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the function.

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.
