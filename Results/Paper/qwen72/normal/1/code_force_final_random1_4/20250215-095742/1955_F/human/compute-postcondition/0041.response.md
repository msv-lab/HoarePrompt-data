The function `func` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function accepts an input `t` which is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, it also accepts a list `p_i` of four integers where each integer is within the range 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours respectively.

The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, so I cannot definitively state what the function returns without additional context. However, based on the typical structure of such functions, it is likely that the function processes these inputs and returns some result based on the counts provided in `p_i`.
