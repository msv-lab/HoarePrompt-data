To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `p_i` is a list of four integers where \(0 \leq p_i \leq 200\).
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers provided by user input.
   - `cnt` is calculated based on the following conditions:
     - If `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]` and `a[0] % 2 == 1` (i.e., the first three elements of `a` are equal and the first element is odd), then `cnt` is \(1 + \sum_{x \in a} \text{math.floor}(x / 2)\).
     - Otherwise, `cnt` is \(\sum_{x \in a} \text{math.floor}(x / 2)\).

2. **Determine the Value of `cnt`:**
   - We need to check the conditions to determine the value of `cnt`.
   - If the first three elements of `a` are equal and the first element is odd, then `cnt` is calculated as \(1 + \sum_{x \in a} \text{math.floor}(x / 2)\).
   - Otherwise, `cnt` is simply \(\sum_{x \in a} \text{math.floor}(x / 2)\).

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `a = [3, 3, 3, 6]`:
     - Check the condition: `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]` and `a[0] % 2 == 1` is true.
     - Calculate `cnt`:
       - \(\sum_{x \in a} \text{math.floor}(x / 2) = \text{math.floor}(3 / 2) + \text{math.floor}(3 / 2) + \text{math.floor}(3 / 2) + \text{math.floor}(6 / 2) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 6\).
       - Therefore, `cnt = 1 + 6 = 7`.

   - Suppose `a = [2, 4, 6, 8]`:
     - Check the condition: `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]` and `a[0] % 2 == 1` is false.
     - Calculate `cnt`:
       - \(\sum_{x \in a} \text{math.floor}(x / 2) = \text{math.floor}(2 / 2) + \text{math.floor}(4 / 2) + \text{math.floor}(6 / 2) + \text{math.floor}(8 / 2) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\).
       - Therefore, `cnt = 10`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `cnt` depends on the specific values in the list `a` and the conditions described.
   - The print statement will output the value of `cnt` based on these conditions.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is calculated as described based on the conditions and the values in the list a)**
