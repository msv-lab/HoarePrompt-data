Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` is a list of four integers where 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers provided by user input, and `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt` to 0, overriding its previous value which was the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the list `a`. The other variables (`t`, `p_i`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
