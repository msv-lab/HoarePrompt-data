Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'). It processes the list `a` based on the characters in `s` to create a new list `b` where elements are taken from the start or end of `a` depending on whether the corresponding character in `s` is 'L' or 'R'. The function then computes the cumulative product of the elements in `b` modulo `m`, starting from the last element of `b` and moving towards the first. The result is returned as a list in reverse order, representing the cumulative product values. **
