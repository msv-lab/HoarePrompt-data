Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly processes the commands as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Reading Input and Outputting Results:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to process the commands and prints the results.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `b` is initialized as an empty list to store the elements being removed.
     - `l` and `r` are initialized to the start and end indices of the array `a`.
   - **Processing Commands:**
     - For each command in `s`, if the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements `r`.
   - **Calculating the Product Modulo `m`:**
     - `ans` is initialized as an empty list to store the results.
     - `p` is initialized to 1 to keep track of the product.
     - The program iterates over the elements in `b` in reverse order, updating `p` with the product modulo `m` and appending the result to `ans`.
   - **Returning the Results:**
     - The function returns the results in the correct order by reversing `ans`.

The program correctly handles the constraints and produces the expected output for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
