Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `i` is 0, the first character of the string `s` is not 'L', `b` is a list that now includes the element `a[r]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b.append(a[r])` appends the element at index `r` of the list `a` to the list `b`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, and the first character of the string `s` remain unchanged.
- The list `b` is updated to include the new element `a[r]`.
