Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `b` is a non-empty list containing all elements from `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s`, `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', otherwise `l` is less than `n`, `r` is `-1` if all characters in `s` are 'R', otherwise `r` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is a list containing the value `p * v % m`, `p` is `p * v % m`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(p)` adds the value of `p` (which is `p * v % m`) to the list `ans`.
- The value of `p` remains `p * v % m` after the operation.
- All other variables (`i`, `b`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged.
