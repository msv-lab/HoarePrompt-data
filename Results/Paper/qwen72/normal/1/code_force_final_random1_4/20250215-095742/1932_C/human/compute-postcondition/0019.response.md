Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `i` is 2, `b` has one more element appended from `a[l-1]`, and `l` is increased by 1.** 

Explanation: The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so `l` is now `l + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial state mentioned that `b` had one more element appended from `a[l]`, and since `l` was increased by 1, the element appended to `b` came from `a[l-1]`.
