### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls the function `func_1` with the appropriate parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`.

3. **Function Implementation**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements that are removed from the array `a`. It also initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to keep track of the left and right boundaries of the array.
   - **Processing Commands**: The function iterates through each command in the string `s`. If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of the array to `b` and increments the left pointer `l`. If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of the array to `b` and decrements the right pointer `r`.
     - **Issue**: The function appends the elements to `b` directly, but it should append the product of the remaining elements modulo `m` at each step, not just the elements themselves.
   - **Product Calculation**: After processing all commands, the function calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, taking the modulus `m` at each step. This ensures that the product does not overflow and remains within the bounds of the modulus.
     - **Issue**: The product calculation is done in reverse order, which is correct, but the elements in `b` should be the products of the remaining elements at each step, not the individual elements.
   - **Result Construction**: The function returns the results in the correct order by reversing the list `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case using the `print` function with the `*` operator to unpack the list returned by `func_1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as a single-element array and multiple test cases correctly.
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the product does not overflow and the results are accurate.

### Issues Identified:
- The function `func_1` incorrectly appends the elements to `b` instead of the product of the remaining elements modulo `m` at each step.
- The correct approach would be to calculate the product of the remaining elements modulo `m` at each step and append that value to `b`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * a[l]) % m
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * a[r]) % m
            r -= 1
        b.append(product)
    return b
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the function `func_1` does not correctly compute the product of the remaining elements modulo `m` at each step.
- The corrected function should be used to ensure the program works as intended.

Final: **False**
