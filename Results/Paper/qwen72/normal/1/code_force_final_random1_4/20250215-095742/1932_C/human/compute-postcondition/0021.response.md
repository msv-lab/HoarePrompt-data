The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `i` is 2, if `s[i]` is 'L', `b` has one more element appended from `a[l]`, and `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `b` now contains the element `a[r+1]` appended to it, and `r` is decreased by 1, and `b` now also contains the element `a[r]` appended to it, and `r` is now `r - 1`.**
