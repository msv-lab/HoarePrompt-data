Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `i` is 2, `b` has one more element appended from `a[l]`, and `l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[l])` appends the element at index `l` of list `a` to list `b`. After this operation, the list `b` has one more element, specifically the element `a[l]`. The variable `l` is then increased by 1, indicating that the next element to be considered from `a` will be at the next index. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
