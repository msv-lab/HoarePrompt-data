The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `i` is 1**
