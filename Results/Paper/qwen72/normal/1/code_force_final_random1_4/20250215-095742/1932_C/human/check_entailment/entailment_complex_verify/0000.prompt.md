You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n-1`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s` (if 'L', elements are taken from the left; if 'R', elements are taken from the right), `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', otherwise `l` is less than `n`, and `r` is `-1` if all characters in `s` are 'R', otherwise `r` is greater than or equal to 0.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n-1`, `b` is a non-empty list containing all elements from `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s`, `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', otherwise `l` is less than `n`, `r` is `-1` if all characters in `s` are 'R', otherwise `r` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of the elements in `b` modulo `m`, starting from the last element of `b` and moving towards the first, and `p` is the final value of the cumulative product modulo `m`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` in reverse order, where `ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of the elements in `b` modulo `m`, starting from the last element of `b` and moving towards the first. The final value of the cumulative product modulo `m` is stored in `p`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'). It processes the list `a` based on the characters in `s` to create a new list `b` where elements are taken from the start or end of `a` depending on whether the corresponding character in `s` is 'L' or 'R'. The function then computes the cumulative product of the elements in `b` modulo `m`, starting from the last element of `b` and moving towards the first. The result is returned as a list in reverse order, representing the cumulative product values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It processes each command in the string `s` and outputs the remainder of the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` when divided by `m`. The program maintains the correct indices for the left (`l`) and right (`r`) ends of the array and updates them accordingly based on the command ('L' or 'R'). The final product is calculated in reverse order to ensure that the product is updated correctly after each removal. This approach ensures that the program handles all edge cases and inputs as specified in the problem description.
