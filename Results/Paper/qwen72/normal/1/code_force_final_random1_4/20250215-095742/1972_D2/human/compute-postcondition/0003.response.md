The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the value `t`. The loop iterates based on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `_` is a placeholder that does not hold any specific value. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `t` must still be greater than 0, and `_` will be incremented to the next value in the range.

Since `_` is a placeholder and its value is not tracked, we focus on `t`. The loop will execute as long as there are remaining iterations, which is determined by the initial value of `t`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `_` will take the next value in the range, but since it's a placeholder, its specific value is not relevant.
- `t` remains the same, but the number of remaining iterations decreases by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value needed), and `func_1()` has been called.** 

However, to be more precise about the state at the start of the next iteration, we should note that the number of remaining iterations is one less than before:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value needed), and `func_1()` has been called, with `t - 1` remaining iterations.**
