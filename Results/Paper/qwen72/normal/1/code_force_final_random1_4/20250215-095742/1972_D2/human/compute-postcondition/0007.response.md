Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value needed), and `func_1()` has been called `t` times, with 0 remaining iterations.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed all its iterations, calling `func_1()` exactly `t` times, and there are no more iterations left to execute. The variable `t` remains the same as it was initially, and the placeholder `_` does not hold any specific value since it is used only for iteration counting.
