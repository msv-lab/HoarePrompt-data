Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. It then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function completes, `t` remains the same integer value read from the input, and `func_1` has been executed `t` times. The function does not return any value. **
