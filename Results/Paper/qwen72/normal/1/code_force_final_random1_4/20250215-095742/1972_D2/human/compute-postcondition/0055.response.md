To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic involved:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- `x` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(x \times x > n\).
- `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is the sum of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs of `x` and `y` where:
  - `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` (i.e., `x` and `y` are coprime).
  - \((x + y) * x <= n\)
  - \((x + y) * y <= m\)

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `x`:**
   - `x` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(x \times x > n\).
   - For example, if \(n = 10\), then \(x = 4\) because \(4 \times 4 = 16 > 10\).

2. **Initialize `y`:**
   - `y` is always 1.

3. **Calculate `cnt`:**
   - We need to find all pairs `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are coprime, and the conditions \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) are satisfied.
   - For each valid pair `(x, y)`, compute `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` and sum these values to get `cnt`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume \(n = 10\) and \(m = 10\):
- `x = 4` (as calculated above).
- `y = 1`.

Check the conditions for the pair `(4, 1)`:
- \((x + y) * x = (4 + 1) * 4 = 20\), which is not less than or equal to 10, so this pair is invalid.
- Since no valid pairs satisfy the conditions, `cnt` will be 0.

### General Case:
For general values of `n` and `m`, the value of `cnt` will depend on the number of valid pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy the conditions. If no valid pairs are found, `cnt` will be 0.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the conditions, the value of `cnt` is determined by the sum of the minimum values for all valid pairs `(x, y)`. Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can only describe the output in general terms.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)) for all pairs of x and y where math.gcd(x, y) == 1 and (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m)**
