### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - For \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) to be a multiple of \(a + b\), we need to consider the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - If \(\gcd(a, b) = d\), then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes \(dy \cdot d\) is a multiple of \(dx + dy\), which simplifies to \(d^2 y\) is a multiple of \(d(x + y)\), or \(dy\) is a multiple of \(x + y\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - It checks if \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - If these conditions are met, it counts the number of valid pairs by adding the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where \(n\) and \(m\) are small (e.g., \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\)).
   - The function also handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) efficiently by iterating up to \(\sqrt{n}\).

5. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, ensuring that the solution works for multiple inputs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It efficiently counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case and handles multiple test cases as required.

Correctness: **True**
