Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(n \geq 3\) and \(m \geq 6\). `x` is 1, `y` is 2. If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is set to `min(n / 2, m // 2) + min(n / 3, m // 4)`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains `min(n / 2, m // 2)`.***
