Output State: **`n` and `m` remain positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `x` is 2, `y` is 1, and `cnt` is the sum of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs of `x` and `y` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and the conditions \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) are satisfied.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is set to 1.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The value of `cnt` remains the same as it was defined in the initial state, which is the sum of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs of `x` and `y` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and the conditions \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) are satisfied.
