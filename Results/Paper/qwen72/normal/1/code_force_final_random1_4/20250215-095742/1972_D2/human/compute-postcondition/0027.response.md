To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

The loop condition is:
```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `m` remain positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(n \geq 6\) and \(m \geq 3\).
- `x` is 2.
- `y` is 2.
- `cnt` is the initial value of `cnt` plus `min(n / 6, m // 3)` if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged.

Let's evaluate the loop condition with the current values:
- `(x + y) * x = (2 + 2) * 2 = 8`
- `(x + y) * y = (2 + 2) * 2 = 8`

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true:
- `8 <= n`
- `8 <= m`

Given that `n` and `m` are already known to be at least 6 and 3 respectively, and since 8 is greater than 6 and 3, we need to ensure that `n` and `m` are at least 8.

Since the only variables in the loop head are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`, and we need to adjust them to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that:
- `n` must be at least 8.
- `m` must be at least 8.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` must be at least 8, `m` must be at least 8, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `cnt` is the initial value of `cnt` plus `min(n / 6, m // 3)` if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged.**
