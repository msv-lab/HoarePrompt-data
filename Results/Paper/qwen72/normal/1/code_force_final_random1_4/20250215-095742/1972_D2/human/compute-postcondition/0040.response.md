Postcondition: **`n` and `m` remain positive integers such that \(12 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(4 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `x` is 3, `y` is 1, and `cnt` remains the sum of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs of `x` and `y` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and the conditions \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) are satisfied. Additionally, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.**
