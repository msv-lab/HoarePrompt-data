The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `y` is 3, so after the increment, `y` becomes 4. The GCD condition and the calculation of `cnt` are not affected by this change, so they remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(n \geq 3\) and \(m \geq 6\). `x` is 1, `y` is 4. If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is set to `min(n / 2, m // 2) + min(n / 3, m // 4) + min(n / 4, m // 12)`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains `min(n / 2, m // 2)`.**
