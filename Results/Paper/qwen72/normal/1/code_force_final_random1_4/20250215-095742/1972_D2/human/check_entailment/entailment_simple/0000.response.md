Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one. This aligns with the problem's requirement to handle multiple test cases.

2. **Pair Generation and Condition Checking**:
   - The program uses nested loops to generate pairs `(x, y)` where `1 <= x <= n` and `1 <= y <= m`.
   - It checks if `gcd(x, y) == 1` to ensure that `x` and `y` are coprime.
   - It then checks if `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` to ensure the pairs fall within the specified bounds.
   - If these conditions are met, it calculates `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` and adds this value to `cnt`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the count of valid pairs for each test case, which is the expected output format.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a loop that runs up to `sqrt(n)` for `x`, and for each `x`, it runs another loop for `y`. This ensures that the program does not exceed the time complexity limits for large values of `n` and `m`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` and `m` are small (e.g., `n = 1` and `m = 1`).

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
