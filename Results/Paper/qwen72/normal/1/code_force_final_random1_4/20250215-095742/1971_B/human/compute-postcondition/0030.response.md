The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'` to the console. The initial state provides detailed information about various variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `c`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the content of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the same string.

Output: **NO**
