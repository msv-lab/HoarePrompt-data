The code `b = ''.join(sorted(s))` sorts the characters in the string `s` and then joins them back into a single string, which is assigned to the variable `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the string `s`, the number of unique characters in `a` is not equal to 2, `b` is a sorted string of `s`.**
