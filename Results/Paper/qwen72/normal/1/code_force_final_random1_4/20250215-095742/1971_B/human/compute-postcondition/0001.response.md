To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is the default behavior of `range(n)`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- Each string `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters
- `n` is an input integer

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, each string `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
