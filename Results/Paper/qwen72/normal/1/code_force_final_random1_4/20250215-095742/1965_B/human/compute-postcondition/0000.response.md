To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run based on the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the result of the function call `func_10()`. The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a positive integer.

Since no variables are passed to `func_15`, and the loop's execution depends on the return value of `func_10()`, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `_` is 0 (or not initialized, as it is not used in the loop head)**
