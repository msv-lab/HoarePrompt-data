The function `func_13` takes two integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is not zero) and returns a tuple of three integers. If `b` is zero, it returns the tuple `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and returns a tuple containing the second element from the recursive call, a calculated value based on the results of the recursive call, and the third element from the recursive call. The purpose of the function is to compute values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, though the exact relationship is not specified in the annotations.
