### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - For all values `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`), there should be a subsequence that sums to `v`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_14**: This function generates the sequence `a` based on the given `n` and `k`.
     - If `k == 1`, it handles a special case where `n == 2` and returns `[1, 2]`.
     - For other values of `n` and `k`, it constructs the sequence using powers of 2 and specific adjustments to ensure the conditions are met.
   - **func_15**: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_14` for each test case, printing the results.

3. **Sequence Construction**:
   - For `k == 1`, the sequence is constructed to handle the special case.
   - For other values of `k`, the sequence is constructed using powers of 2 and additional elements to ensure the sum conditions are met.
   - The sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by carefully choosing elements and their sums.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases like `k == 1` and `n == 2` correctly.
   - The sequence construction ensures that all values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) have a subsequence that sums to them.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the problem requirements, printing the size of the sequence followed by the sequence itself.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly generates the required sequence for the given problem. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the sequence meets the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
