Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_14` generates a sequence that may not meet the requirement that there is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`. For example, consider the input `(n, k) = (8, 8)`:

- The program generates the sequence `[1, 2, 4, 1, 9, 17]`.
- However, the subsequence `[1, 2, 4, 1]` sums to `8`, which violates the condition that there should be no subsequence summing to `k`.

This indicates that the program does not correctly ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
