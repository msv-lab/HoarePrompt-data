The code appends \(2^i\) to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is \(lk - 1\), the value appended is \(2^{(lk - 1)}\). The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing the values \([1, 2, 4, \ldots, 2^{(lk-2)}, k - 2^{(lk-1)}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^{(lk-2)}, 2^{(lk-1)}]\), `lk` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is \(lk - 1\), `lk` must be less than `l`.**
