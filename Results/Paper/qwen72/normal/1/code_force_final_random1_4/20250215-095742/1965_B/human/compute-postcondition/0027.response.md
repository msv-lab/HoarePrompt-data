The code snippet `ans.append(k + 1)` appends the value of `k + 1` to the list `ans`. This impacts the list `ans` by adding a new element at the end.

Let's break down the changes:

- `ans` was initially a list containing the values \([1, 2, 4, \ldots, 2^{(lk-2)}, k - 2^{(lk-1)}]\).
- After executing the code, `ans` now contains the same elements plus the new element `k + 1`.

All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing the values \([1, 2, 4, \ldots, 2^{(lk-2)}, k - 2^{(lk-1)}, k + 1]\), `lk` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is \(lk - 2\).**
