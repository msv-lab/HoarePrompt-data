The code snippet `sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')` writes the string representation of the return value of `func_14()` followed by a newline character to the standard output. This does not affect the variables `func_10()`, `_`, or the fact that the return value of `func_14()` has already been printed to the standard output.

However, since the return value of `func_14()` is being written to the standard output again, the output state includes the fact that the return value of `func_14()` has been printed to the standard output once more.

Output State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `_` is 0 (or not initialized), the return value of `func_14()` has been printed to the standard output twice.**
