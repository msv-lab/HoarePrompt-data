To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `tc` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is the number of unique integers in `arr` and must be greater than 0.
   - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `dp` is `True` if any of the differences `arr[j] - arr[j + 1] > 1` for `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` or if the original `dp` was `True`, otherwise `dp` is `False`.

2. **Understanding the `dp` Condition:**
   - The variable `dp` is determined by checking if any difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr` (excluding the last 0) is greater than 1.
   - If such a difference exists, `dp` is set to `True`.
   - If no such difference exists, `dp` remains `False`.

3. **Evaluating the `print` Statement:**
   - The `print` statement will print 'Alice' if `dp` is `True`.
   - It will print 'Bob' if `dp` is `False`.

4. **Determining the Value of `dp`:**
   - Since `arr` is sorted in descending order and followed by a 0, the only way `dp` would be `False` is if all differences between consecutive elements (excluding the last 0) are exactly 1.
   - If there is any difference greater than 1, `dp` will be `True`.

Given the conditions, let's consider the possible scenarios:
- If all elements in `arr` (excluding the last 0) are consecutive integers, then `dp` will be `False`.
- If there is any gap greater than 1 between any two consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last 0), then `dp` will be `True`.

Since the problem does not specify that the elements in `arr` are necessarily consecutive, it is more likely that there will be a gap greater than 1, making `dp` `True`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Alice**
