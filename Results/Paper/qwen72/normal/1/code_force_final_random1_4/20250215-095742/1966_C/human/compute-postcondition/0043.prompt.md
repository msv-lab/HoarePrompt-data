Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. tc is an input integer. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of piles. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
while tc > 0:
    n = int(input())
    arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True
        ) + [0]
    dp = True
    n = len(arr) - 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp = arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp
    print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
    tc -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is an input integer and must be greater than 0 but now `tc` is `tc - 1`, `n` is the number of unique integers in `arr` and must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is `True` if any of the differences `arr[j] - arr[j + 1] > 1` for `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` or if the original `dp` was `True`, otherwise `dp` is `False`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is an input integer and must be greater than 0 but now `tc` is `tc - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value provided by the user, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is `True` if any `arr[j] - arr[j + 1] > 1` for `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` or `dp` was initially `False`, otherwise `dp` is `False`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `tc` is decreased by 1. All other conditions remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
