To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `tc` is an input integer and must be greater than 0. After the initial state, `tc` is updated to `tc - 1` and must still be greater than 0.
   - `n` is the integer value provided by the user.
   - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `dp` is `True` if any `arr[j] - arr[j + 1] > 1` for `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` or `dp` was initially `False`, otherwise `dp` is `False`.

2. **Understanding the Conditions:**
   - `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a 0.
   - `dp` is determined by checking if there is any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` that is greater than 1.

3. **Evaluating `dp`:**
   - If there exists any `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` such that `arr[j] - arr[j + 1] > 1`, then `dp` is `True`.
   - Otherwise, `dp` is `False`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement will print 'Alice' if `dp` is `True`, otherwise it will print 'Bob'.

Given the conditions, let's analyze the possible outcomes:

- If `arr` contains any two consecutive elements where the difference is greater than 1, `dp` will be `True`.
- If all consecutive elements in `arr` have a difference of 1 or less, `dp` will be `False`.

Since `arr` is sorted in descending order and followed by a 0, the last element of `arr` (before the 0) will always be greater than 0. Therefore, the difference between the last element and 0 will always be greater than 1.

Thus, `dp` will always be `True`.

Output: **Alice**
