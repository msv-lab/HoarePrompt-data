Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 0 (since it has been decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0), `n` is the number of unique integers in `arr` and must be greater than 0 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0 for each test case, `i` is `n-1` for each test case, and `dp` is `True` if any of the differences `arr[j] - arr[j + 1] > 1` for `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` or if the original `dp` was `True` for each test case, otherwise `dp` is `False`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, as it was initially.
- The variable `tc` is now 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- For each test case, `n` represents the number of unique integers in the array `arr`, which is always greater than 0.
- The array `arr` contains the unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a 0 appended at the end.
- The variable `i` is set to `n-1` for each test case, reflecting the last index of the non-zero elements in `arr`.
- The variable `dp` is determined based on the condition that any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is greater than 1, or if the initial `dp` was `True`. If this condition is met, `dp` is `True`; otherwise, it is `False`. This result is printed as 'Alice' if `dp` is `True` and 'Bob' if `dp` is `False` for each test case.
