### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to remove `k` stones from each non-empty pile.
   - The value of `k` must be a positive integer and at most the size of the smallest non-empty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (all piles are empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the number of distinct pile sizes.
   - If the number of distinct pile sizes is odd, Alice can always force a win by making the number of distinct pile sizes even after her turn.
   - Conversely, if the number of distinct pile sizes is even, Bob can always force a win by making the number of distinct pile sizes odd after his turn.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles `arr`.
   - It sorts the unique pile sizes in descending order and appends a zero to handle edge cases.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `dp` to `True`, which will be used to track the winning condition.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes and updates `dp` based on the difference between consecutive pile sizes.
   - If the difference between consecutive pile sizes is greater than 1, or if `dp` is `False`, it toggles `dp`.
   - Finally, it prints "Alice" if `dp` is `True` and "Bob" otherwise.

4. **Function Summary Validation:**
   - The function summary accurately describes the program's behavior.
   - The program correctly identifies the number of distinct pile sizes and uses this information to determine the winner.
   - The logic of toggling `dp` based on the difference between consecutive pile sizes ensures that the program correctly handles the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes.
   - The program handles the edge cases and input constraints as specified in the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases and Input Constraints:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where all piles have the same size.
   - The program also handles the case where the number of piles is very large (up to \(2 \times 10^5\)) and the size of the piles is very large (up to \(10^9\)).
   - The use of `set` to remove duplicates and sorting ensures that the program efficiently processes the input.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Final: **True**
