The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. It then processes these inputs to determine the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on specific rules. The function prints "Alice" if the game can be won by Alice under optimal play conditions, otherwise, it prints "Bob". After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `tc` set to 0, and the state of other variables (`n`, `arr`, `dp`, etc.) being irrelevant as they are local to each test case.
