Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the new input.** 

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `nums`. The values of `t`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged.
