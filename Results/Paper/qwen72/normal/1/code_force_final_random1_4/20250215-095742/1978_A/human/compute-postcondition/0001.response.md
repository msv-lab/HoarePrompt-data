The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly set to a value; it will take values from 0 to `t-1` as the loop iterates.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0 (placeholder, will iterate from 0 to t-1)**
