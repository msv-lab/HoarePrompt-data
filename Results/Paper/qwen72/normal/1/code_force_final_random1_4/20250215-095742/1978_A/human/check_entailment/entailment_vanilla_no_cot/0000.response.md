Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it assumes that the last element and the second-to-last element (or any other specific elements) in the list `nums` will always be the largest values when the books are divided into two piles. However, this is not necessarily true. The problem requires finding the maximum number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two non-empty piles and reading the book with the most pages from each pile. To solve this correctly, we need to identify the two largest values in the list `nums` and sum them up.

A correct approach would involve sorting the list and selecting the two largest elements, or using a more efficient method to find the two largest elements without sorting the entire list. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Find the two largest elements in the list
        max1 = max(nums)
        nums.remove(max1)
        max2 = max(nums)
        print(max1 + max2)
```

This version correctly identifies the two largest elements and sums them, ensuring the maximum number of pages Alice can read.
