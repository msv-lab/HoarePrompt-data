To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `j` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `n - 1 - j`
- `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`
- `B` is an empty list
- `idx_B` is an empty list
- `j` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- If the character at position `i` in the string `s` is '<', `idx_B` is now a list containing the value `i`. If `idx_B` was empty before, `B` is `[0]` and `idx_B` is no longer an empty list. Otherwise, `B` is `[x]` where `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, and `idx_B` is not empty.
- If the character at position `i` in the string `s` is not '<', the lists `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `j` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `j`.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is now 1.
- `n` must still be greater than `j`, so `n` must be greater than 1.

The other variables (`i`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`i` is `n - 1 - j`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1. If the character at position `i` in the string `s` is '<', `idx_B` is now a list containing the value `i`. If `idx_B` was empty before, `B` is `[0]` and `idx_B` is no longer an empty list. Otherwise, `B` is `[x]` where `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, and `idx_B` is not empty. If the character at position `i` in the string `s` is not '<', the lists `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged.**
