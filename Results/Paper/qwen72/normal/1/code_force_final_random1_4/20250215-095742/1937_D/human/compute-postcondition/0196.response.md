Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `B[r-1]`, `b` is `A[l-1] - A[l-r-2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 2.
- The value of `r` is still decreased by 1.
- The value of `a` remains `B[r-1]`.
- The value of `b` is updated to `A[l-1] - A[l-r-2]`. This means `b` now holds the value of `A[l-1]` minus the value of `A[l-r-2]`.
