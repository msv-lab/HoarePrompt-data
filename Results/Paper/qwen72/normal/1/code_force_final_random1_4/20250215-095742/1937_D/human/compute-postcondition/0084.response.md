Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- The first character of `s` is '>'.
- `l` is greater than or equal to `r`.
- `r` is not equal to 0.
- `a` is `B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r`.
- `b` is `b - idx_A[l - 1] * r`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is 0.

2. **Value of `n`:**
   - `n` is greater than 0. Let's denote it as `n`.

3. **Value of `a`:**
   - `a` is defined as `B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r`.
   - Here, `B[r - 1]` is the element at index `r - 1` in the list `B`.
   - `idx_B[r - 1]` is the element at index `r - 1` in the list `idx_B`.
   - Therefore, `a = B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r`.

4. **Value of `b`:**
   - `b` is defined as `b - idx_A[l - 1] * r`.
   - Here, `b` is initially some value (let's denote it as `b_initial`).
   - `idx_A[l - 1]` is the element at index `l - 1` in the list `idx_A`.
   - Therefore, `b = b_initial - idx_A[l - 1] * r`.

5. **Expression in the Print Statement:**
   - The expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`.
   - Substituting the values:
     - `a * 2` becomes `(B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r) * 2`.
     - `b * 2` becomes `(b_initial - idx_A[l - 1] * r) * 2`.
     - `(n - i)` becomes `n - 0` which is `n`.

6. **Combining the Terms:**
   - The expression simplifies to:
     \[
     (B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r) * 2 + (b_initial - idx_A[l - 1] * r) * 2 + n
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     2 * B[r - 1] + 2 * idx_B[r - 1] * r + 2 * b_initial - 2 * idx_A[l - 1] * r + n
     \]

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the result of the expression:
\[
2 * B[r - 1] + 2 * idx_B[r - 1] * r + 2 * b_initial - 2 * idx_A[l - 1] * r + n
\]

Since the exact values of `B[r - 1]`, `idx_B[r - 1]`, `b_initial`, `idx_A[l - 1]`, and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **2 * B[r - 1] + 2 * idx_B[r - 1] * r + 2 * b_initial - 2 * idx_A[l - 1] * r + n (where B[r - 1] is the element at index r - 1 in the list B, idx_B[r - 1] is the element at index r - 1 in the list idx_B, b_initial is the initial value of b, idx_A[l - 1] is the element at index l - 1 in the list idx_A, and n is a positive integer)**
