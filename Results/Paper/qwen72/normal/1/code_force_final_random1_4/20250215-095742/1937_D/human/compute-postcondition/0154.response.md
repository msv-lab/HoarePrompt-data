Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is the value of `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated to `b - A[l - r - 2]`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `r`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
