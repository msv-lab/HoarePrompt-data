Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is not an empty list, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', `x` is `(i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**

Explanation:
- `A` is an empty list, so `len(A) - 1` is `-1`. Since `A` is empty, accessing `A[-1]` would raise an IndexError, but since `A` is empty, the expression `A[len(A) - 1]` evaluates to 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `idx_A` is not an empty list, so `len(idx_A) - 1` gives the last index of `idx_A`.
- `idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]` gives the last element of `idx_A`.
- `i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]` calculates the difference between `i` (which is 0) and the last element of `idx_A`.
- Multiplying this difference by `len(idx_A)` gives the final value of `x`.
- The value of `x` is thus `(i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
