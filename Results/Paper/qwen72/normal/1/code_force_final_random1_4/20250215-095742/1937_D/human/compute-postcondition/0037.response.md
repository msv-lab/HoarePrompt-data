Output State: **`i` is `n - 1 - j`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is now `[x]`, `idx_B` is not empty, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at position `i` in the string `s` is '<', and `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`.
- Since `B` was initially an empty list, appending `x` to `B` results in `B` being `[x]`.
- All other variables (`i`, `A`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, `j`, `n`, and the character at position `i` in `s`) remain unchanged.
