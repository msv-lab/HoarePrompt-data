To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `r` is decreased by 1 (though `r` is not used in the `print` statement, so it doesn't affect our calculation).
- `idx_A` is a list, but its specific values are not provided.
- `l` is the length of `idx_A`.

### Expression Breakdown:
The expression inside the `print` statement is:
```python
n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2
```

Let's evaluate this step by step:

1. **Evaluate `i`**:
   - `i` is 2.

2. **Evaluate `n`**:
   - `n` is greater than 2, but its exact value is not specified. Let's denote it as `n`.

3. **Evaluate `idx_A[l - 1]`**:
   - `l` is the length of `idx_A`.
   - `idx_A[l - 1]` is the last element of the list `idx_A`. Since the specific values of `idx_A` are not provided, we will denote the last element as `last_idx_A`.

4. **Substitute the values into the expression**:
   - The expression becomes: `n - 2 + (2 - last_idx_A) * 2`.

5. **Simplify the expression**:
   - First, calculate `(2 - last_idx_A) * 2`:
     - This simplifies to `4 - 2 * last_idx_A`.
   - Now, substitute back into the main expression:
     - `n - 2 + 4 - 2 * last_idx_A`.
   - Combine like terms:
     - `n + 2 - 2 * last_idx_A`.

### Final Expression:
The expression `n + 2 - 2 * last_idx_A` will be printed.

### Output:
Since the exact value of `n` and `last_idx_A` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n + 2 - 2 * last_idx_A (where n is greater than 2 and last_idx_A is the last element of the list idx_A)**
