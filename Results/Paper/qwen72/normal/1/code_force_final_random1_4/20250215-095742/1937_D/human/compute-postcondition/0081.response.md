Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the first character of `s` is '>', `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`, and the difference between `l` and `r` is greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated to `b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`, `l`, `r`, `a`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `b` is calculated as `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`.
