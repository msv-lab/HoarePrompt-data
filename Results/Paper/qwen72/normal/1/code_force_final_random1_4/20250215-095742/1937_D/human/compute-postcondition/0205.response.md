The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string of length n (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function processes this string and returns a result based on the content of the string.

To determine the functionality, let's break down the possible outputs:

- The function might count the number of '<' and '>' characters.
- It could check for balanced pairs of '<' and '>'.
- It might return some form of processed string or a boolean indicating a specific condition.

However, without more specific details about the output, we can only generalize based on the typical behavior of functions dealing with such strings.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. It processes the string and returns a result based on the content of the string, which could include counting characters, checking for balanced pairs, or other operations related to the sequence of '<' and '>' characters.**
