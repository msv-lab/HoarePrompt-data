Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- The character at index 0 of `s` is not '>'.
- `r` is decreased by 1.
- `l` is greater than `r`.
- `r` is not equal to 0.
- `a` is the value of `B[r]`.
- If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is the value of `A[l - 1]` minus `A[l - r - 2]` minus `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` minus `idx_A[l - 1] * (r + 1)`.
- Otherwise, `b` is the value of `A[l - 1]` minus `idx_A[l - 1] * (r + 1)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 0 (let's denote it as `n`).
   - `r` is decreased by 1, so let's assume `r` was initially some positive integer `k`, now `r = k - 1`.
   - `l` is greater than `r`, so `l > k - 1`.
   - `a` is the value of `B[k - 1]`.
   - `b` depends on the condition `l - r - 1 > 0`:
     - If `l - (k - 1) - 1 > 0` (which simplifies to `l - k > 0` or `l > k`), then:
       \[
       b = A[l - 1] - A[l - k - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - k - 2]) \cdot (l - k - 1) - idx_A[l - 1] \cdot (k)
       \]
     - Otherwise, if `l - k <= 0` (which simplifies to `l <= k`), then:
       \[
       b = A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - 1] \cdot (k)
       \]

2. **Expression to Print:**
   - The expression to print is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`.
   - Since `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a * 2 + b * 2 + n`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:
- `a` is the value of `B[k - 1]`.
- `b` is calculated based on the condition `l > k` or `l <= k`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + n (where `a` is the value of `B[k - 1]`, `b` is calculated based on the condition `l > k` or `l <= k`, and `n` is the value of `n`)**
