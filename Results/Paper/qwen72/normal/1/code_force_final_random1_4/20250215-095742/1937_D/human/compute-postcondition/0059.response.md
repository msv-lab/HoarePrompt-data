Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `-1`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` will contain the calculated values for each position of '<' characters in the string `s`, and `idx_B` will contain the indices of these '<' characters. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty. `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`.**
