Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `r` is decreased by 1.
- `a` is the value of `B[r]`.
- `b` is now `b + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

### Variables and Their Values:
- `i = 1`
- `n > 1` (exact value of `n` is not specified, but it is greater than 1)
- `r` is decreased by 1, so if the original value of `r` was `R`, then `r = R - 1`.
- `a = B[r]` (where `r` is the new value after being decreased by 1)
- `b` is updated to `b + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

### Calculation:
1. **Calculate `a * 2`**:
   - `a` is the value of `B[r]`.
   - Therefore, `a * 2` is `2 * B[r]`.

2. **Calculate `b * 2`**:
   - `b` is updated to `b + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
   - Therefore, `b * 2` is `2 * (b + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r)`.

3. **Calculate `(n - i)`**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - Therefore, `(n - i)` is `n - 1`.

4. **Combine the results**:
   - The expression inside the print statement is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`.
   - Substituting the values, we get:
     \[
     2 * B[r] + 2 * (b + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r) + (n - 1)
     \]

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `2 * B[r] + 2 * (b + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r) + (n - 1)` followed by a space.

Output: **2 * B[r] + 2 * (b + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r) + (n - 1) (where `B[r]` is the value of the element in list `B` at index `r`, `b` is the updated value of `b`, `idx_A[l - 1]` is the value of the element in list `idx_A` at index `l - 1`, and `n` is the value of `n` which is greater than 1)**
