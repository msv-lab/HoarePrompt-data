Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the element at index `l` of list `A`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is the element at index `r - 1` of list `B` minus the element at index `r - (l + 2)` of list `B` minus `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. Otherwise, `b` remains the element at index `r - 1` of list `B`.***
