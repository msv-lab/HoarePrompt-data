To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must still hold true. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be 2. For the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
