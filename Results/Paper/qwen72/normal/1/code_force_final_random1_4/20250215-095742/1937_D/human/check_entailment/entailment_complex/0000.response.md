Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave a one-dimensional grid based on the direction indicators ('<' or '>') at each cell. The solution involves two main parts: processing the '>' characters and processing the '<' characters, followed by combining the results to compute the time for each cell.

1. **Processing '>' Characters:**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - For each '>' character, it calculates the cumulative effect of all previous '>' characters and stores the result in list `A`.
   - The index of each '>' character is stored in `idx_A`.

2. **Processing '<' Characters:**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
   - For each '<' character, it calculates the cumulative effect of all previous '<' characters and stores the result in list `B`.
   - The index of each '<' character is stored in `idx_B`.

3. **Combining Results:**
   - The program then iterates through the string `s` again to compute the time for each cell.
   - Depending on whether the current character is '>' or '<', it uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The results are printed directly.

### Key Points:
- **Correct Handling of '>' and '<':** The program correctly handles the cumulative effects of '>' and '<' characters.
- **Boundary Conditions:** The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when there are no '>' or '<' characters.
- **Output Format:** The program prints the results in the required format, with each result separated by a space.

### Verification:
- The program's logic aligns with the problem statement.
- The intermediate states and final states of the program are consistent with the expected behavior.
- The program handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
