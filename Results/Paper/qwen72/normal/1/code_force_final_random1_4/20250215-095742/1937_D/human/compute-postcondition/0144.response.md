The code snippet `b = b - B[r - l]` updates the value of `b`. Initially, `b` is set to `B[r]`. After executing the code, `b` is updated to `B[r] - B[r - l]`.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `r`, `a`) remain unchanged. The specific values or expressions for these variables are as follows:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `r` is decreased by 1
- `a` is `A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l]`.**
