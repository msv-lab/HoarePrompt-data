Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is assigned the value at index `l` of the list `A`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is now `b - (idx_B[r - (l + 2)] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (r - (l + 2) + 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged.
- The value of `a` remains the value at index `l` of the list `A`.
- The value of `x` remains `r - (l + 2)`.
- The value of `b` is updated to `b - (idx_B[r - (l + 2)] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (r - (l + 2) + 1)`. This means `b` is reduced by the product of the difference between `idx_B[r - (l + 2)]` and `idx_B[r - 1]` and the value of `x + 1`.
