Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is the value of `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` from its current value.
- The new value of `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `r`, `a`) remain unchanged.
