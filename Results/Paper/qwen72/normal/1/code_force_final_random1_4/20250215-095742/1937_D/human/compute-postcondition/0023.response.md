Output State: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` remains greater than 2, `i` remains 2, `A` is updated to include the new value `x` which is `A_last + (2 - idx_A_last) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` remains unchanged, `x` is now equal to `A_last + (2 - idx_A_last) * len(idx_A)`.**
