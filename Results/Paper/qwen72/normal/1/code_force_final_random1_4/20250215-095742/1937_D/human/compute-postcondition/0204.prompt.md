Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `-1`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` will contain the calculated values for each position of '<' characters in the string `s`, and `idx_B` will contain the indices of these '<' characters. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty. `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if l < r:
            a = A[l]
            x = r - (l + 2)
            b = B[r - 1]
            if x >= 0:
                b = b - B[x]
                b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
            b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 1]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1
        if l <= r:
            if l == 0:
                print(i + 1, end=' ')
            else:
                a = A[l - 1]
                a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l
                b = B[r]
                if r - l >= 0:
                    b = b - B[r - l]
                    b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)
                b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l
                print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r]
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r - 1 > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 2]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If the first character of `s` is '>', and `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is `idx_B[r - 1] * (l + 1)`. If `l` is greater than or equal to `r` and `r` is 0, the conditions remain unchanged. If `l` is greater than or equal to `r` and `r` is not 0, `a` is updated to `B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r`, and `b` is updated to `b - idx_A[l - 1] * r`. In all cases where the first character of `s` is '>', `l` is incremented by 1. If the first character of `s` is not '>', `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `l` is 0, no further changes occur. If `l` is not 0, `a` is the element at index `l - 1` of `A` plus `(0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - idx_B[r - l] * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 0) * l` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `b` is the element at index `r` of `B` plus `(idx_B[r] - 0) * l`. If `l` is greater than `r` and `r` is 0, no further changes occur. If `r` is not 0, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, and if `l - r - 1 > 0`, `b` is the value of `A[l - 1]` minus `A[l - r - 2]` minus `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` minus `idx_A[l - 1] * (r + 1)`. If `l - r - 1 <= 0`, `b` is the value of `A[l - 1]` minus `idx_A[l - 1] * (r + 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `s[i] == '>'`, and `l < r`, `a` is the element at index `l` of list `A`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1)`. If `l >= r` and `r == 0`, no changes are made. Otherwise, `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r`, and `b` is initially set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `l - r > 0`, `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. Otherwise, `b` remains as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. `l` is now `l + 1`. If `s[i] != '>'`, `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is 0, no further changes occur. If `l` is greater than 0 and `l <= r`, `a` is set to `A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. If `r - l >= 0`, `b` is updated to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 1) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 1) * l`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - 1) * l`. If `l` is greater than 0 and `l > r`, `a` is set to the value of `B[r]`, and `b` is updated to `b + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `r` was initially 0, no further changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `s[i] == '>'`, `l` is incremented by 1. If `l < r`, `a` is assigned the value at index `l` of the list `A`, `x` is set to `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is set to `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1)`. If `l >= r`, no changes are made to `a` or `b` if `r == 0`. If `r != 0`, `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * r`. If `l - r > 0`, `b` is set to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. Otherwise, `b` is set to `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `s[i] != '>'`, `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `l` is 0, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, `a` is assigned the value of `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is assigned the value of `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 2) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 2) * l`. If `r - l >= 0`, `b` is further modified to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 2) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 2) * l`. If `l` is greater than `r` and `r` was initially 0, no further changes occur. Otherwise, `a` is set to `B[r-1]`, and if `l - r - 1 > 0`, `b` is set to `A[l-1] - A[l-r-2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. If `l - r - 1 <= 0`, `b` is set to `A[l-1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
