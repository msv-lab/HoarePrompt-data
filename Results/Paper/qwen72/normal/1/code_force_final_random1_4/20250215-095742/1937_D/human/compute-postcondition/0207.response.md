Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and prints the minimum number of swaps required to rearrange the string so that all '<' characters come before any '>' characters. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly. The string `s` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the function. **
