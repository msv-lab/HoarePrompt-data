Initial State: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `r` is decreased by 1.

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. The variable `i` is explicitly given as 2.
2. The `print` statement is `print(i + 1, end=' ')`.
3. The expression `i + 1` evaluates to `2 + 1`, which is 3.
4. The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function means that the output will be followed by a space instead of a newline.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the number 3 followed by a space.

Output: **3 **
