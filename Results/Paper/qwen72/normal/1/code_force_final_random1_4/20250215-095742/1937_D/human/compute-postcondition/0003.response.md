The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be 0.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
