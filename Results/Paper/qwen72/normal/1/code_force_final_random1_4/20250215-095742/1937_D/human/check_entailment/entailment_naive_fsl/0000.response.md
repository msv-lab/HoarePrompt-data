Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not handle all potential cases correctly. One specific issue is that the program does not correctly handle the case where the pinball is placed on the last cell of the grid and the cell contains a '>'. According to the problem description, the pinball should move to the right and leave the grid immediately, but the program does not seem to account for this scenario correctly.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
>>>
```
The expected output should be:
```
1 2 1
```
However, the program's output for the third cell (where the pinball is placed on the last cell) is incorrect. The program does not correctly handle the immediate exit condition for the last cell when it contains a '>'. This indicates that the program is not fully correct for all potential cases.
