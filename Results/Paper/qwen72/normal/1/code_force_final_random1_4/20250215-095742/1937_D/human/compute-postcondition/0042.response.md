Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is updated to `n - 1 - j`. Given that `j` is 1, `i` becomes `n - 2`.
- The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `j`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
