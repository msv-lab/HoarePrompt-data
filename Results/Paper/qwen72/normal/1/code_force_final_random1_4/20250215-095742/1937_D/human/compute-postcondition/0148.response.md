Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. If `r - l >= 0`, `b` is updated to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 1) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 1) * l`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - 1) * l`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is 1.
- The value of `n` is greater than 1.
- The value of `r` is decreased by 1.
- The value of `a` is `A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- The value of `b` is updated by adding `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` to its current value. Since `i` is 1, this simplifies to `(idx_B[r] - 1) * l`.
- If `r - l >= 0`, `b` was initially `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 1) * (r - l)`. After the update, `b` becomes `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 1) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 1) * l`.
- If `r - l < 0`, `b` was initially `B[r]`. After the update, `b` becomes `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - 1) * l`.
