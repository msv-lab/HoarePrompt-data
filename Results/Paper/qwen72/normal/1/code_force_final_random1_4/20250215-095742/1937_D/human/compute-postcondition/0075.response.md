Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- The first character of `s` is '>'.
- `l` is greater than or equal to `r`.
- `r` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is 0.
- The variable `n` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified. Let's denote it as `n` (where `n > 0`).
- The expression `n - i` simplifies to `n - 0`, which is just `n`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the value of `n` followed by a space (because `end=' '`).

Output: **n (where n is the value of n, and n > 0)**
