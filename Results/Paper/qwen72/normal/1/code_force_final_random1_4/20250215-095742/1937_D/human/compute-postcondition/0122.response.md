Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the element at index `l` of list `A`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is the element at index `r - 1` of list `B`.** 

The value of `b` is now the element at index `r - 1` of list `B`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
