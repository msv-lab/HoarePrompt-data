Based on the initial state where `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2, let's determine what will be printed when the `print` statement is executed.

1. The variable `i` is explicitly given as 2.
2. The variable `n` is described as being greater than 2, but its exact value is not specified.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

This statement will print the result of the expression `n - i` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since `i` is 2, the expression `n - i` simplifies to `n - 2`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `n - 2` followed by a space.

Output: **n - 2 (where n is an integer greater than 2)**
