Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the first character of `s` is '>', `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged as `B[r - 1]`.***
