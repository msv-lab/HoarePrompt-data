Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the element at index `l` of list `A`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is the element at index `r - 1` of list `B` minus the element at index `r - (l + 2)` of list `B` minus `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from its previous value.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `x`) remain unchanged.
