Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The function then determines and prints the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob') based on the unique values in the list and their differences. Specifically, if the list contains only one unique value or does not contain the value 1, Alice wins. Otherwise, the function checks the gaps between consecutive unique values; if any gap is greater than 1, the winner depends on the position of the gap (odd or even). If no such gap exists, the winner is determined by the parity of the number of unique values. After processing all test cases, the function ends. **
