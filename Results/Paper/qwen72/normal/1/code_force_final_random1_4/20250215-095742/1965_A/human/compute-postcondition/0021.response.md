Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, the first element of `arr` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list containing unique elements from `arr` in ascending order and must have a length greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `A` is False. If `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, then `not_c` is False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True.***
