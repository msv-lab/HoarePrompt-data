### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - It reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - **Initial Condition Check**:
     - The function checks if the smallest pile size is not 1. If it is not 1, it immediately returns 'Alice'. This is correct because Alice can always win by removing all stones from the smallest pile, making the game trivial for her.
   - **Set and Sort**:
     - The program converts the pile sizes to a set to remove duplicates and sorts them. This is done to check the differences between consecutive pile sizes.
   - **Difference Check**:
     - The loop iterates through the sorted set and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1. If it is, the game is not continuous, and the variable `A` is toggled.
   - **Continuous Game Check**:
     - If the game is continuous (all differences are 1), the variable `A` is toggled again.
   - **Return Statement**:
     - Finally, the function returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True`, otherwise 'Bob'.

3. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The logic for determining the winner is based on the idea that if the smallest pile is not 1, Alice can always win by removing all stones from the smallest pile.
   - If the smallest pile is 1, the game becomes more complex. The program checks if the differences between consecutive pile sizes are all 1. If they are, the game is continuous, and the winner depends on the parity of the number of piles. If the differences are not all 1, the game is not continuous, and the winner also depends on the parity of the number of piles.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when the smallest pile is 1 and when the differences between consecutive pile sizes are not all 1.

### Issues Found:
- **Incorrect Initial Condition Check**:
  - The function `func_1` checks if `arr[0] != 1` to determine if Alice wins immediately. However, this is incorrect because `arr[0]` might not be the smallest pile. The correct check should be `min(arr) != 1`.
- **Toggling Logic**:
  - The toggling logic is flawed. The variable `A` is toggled multiple times, which may not accurately reflect the game's state. The correct approach should be to count the number of distinct pile sizes and determine the winner based on the parity of this count.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(arr):
    min_pile = min(arr)
    if min_pile != 1:
        return 'Alice'
    
    set_ = set(arr)
    if len(set_) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was **inaccurate** due to the incorrect initial condition check and flawed toggling logic. The corrected function correctly determines the winner based on the game rules and constraints.

Final: **False**
