To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`.
- `j` is the index where the loop broke out or reached the end of the list `lis`.
- `test` is a boolean indicating whether the loop found any gaps greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `lis`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head only involves the variable `i` and the constant `t`.
- The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 1.
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `t`.

### Updated State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- The condition `i < t` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `j` is the index where the loop broke out or reached the end of the list `lis`. If `1` is not in `lis` or `len(lis) == 1`, `test` is False. Otherwise, `test` indicates whether the loop found any gaps greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `lis`. If `test` is True, the loop found at least one gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `lis`, and the length of `lis` can be either an odd or an even number.**
