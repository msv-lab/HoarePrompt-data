Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `j` is the index where the loop broke out or reached the end of the list `lis`, and `test` indicates whether the loop found any gaps greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `lis`. If `test` is True, the loop found at least one gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `lis`, and the length of `lis` is either an odd number or an even number.***
