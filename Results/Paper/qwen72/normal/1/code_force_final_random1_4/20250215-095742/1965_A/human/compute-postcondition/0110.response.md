Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 4 elements, `j` is 3. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, `test` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement following the if block.***
