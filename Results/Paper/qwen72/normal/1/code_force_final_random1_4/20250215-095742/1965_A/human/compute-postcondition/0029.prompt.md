You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of arr is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    if (arr[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'.
    #State: *`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `A` is False, and the first element of `arr` is 1
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, the first element of `arr` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list containing unique elements from `arr` in ascending order, `not_c` is False, `A` is either True or False depending on the final value of `i` (if the loop completes without breaking, `A` will be the opposite of its initial value based on the number of iterations), and `i` is the last index the loop iterated over, which is `len(set_) - 1` if the loop completes without breaking.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: *`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, the first element of `arr` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list containing unique elements from `arr` in ascending order, `not_c` is False, and `A` is the opposite of its initial value. If `not_c` is False, `i` is the last index the loop iterated over, which is `len(set_) - 1` if the loop completes without breaking.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. Given that `A` is the opposite of its initial value and `not_c` is False, `A` would be True, so the program returns 'Alice'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of positive integers `arr` and always returns 'Alice'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'Alice'.

Case_2: The program returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. Given that `A` is the opposite of its initial value and `not_c` is False, `A` would be True, so the program returns 'Alice'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
