Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements, `j` is 1, and `test` is True. If the difference between the second element and the first element of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with `test` remaining True.***
