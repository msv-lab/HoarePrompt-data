Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, and `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If 1 is in `lis` and the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `j` is the index where the loop broke out or reached the end of the list `lis`. If `test` was initially True, and the difference between any two consecutive elements in `lis` is greater than 1, the loop prints 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the parity of `j` and sets `test` to False, breaking out of the loop. Otherwise, the loop completes without printing anything and `test` remains False. If `test` was initially False, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
