Functionality: ** The function `func_2` takes five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. It sorts the `numbers` list in descending order and then distributes the numbers into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`) based on some internal logic (not shown). After distributing the numbers, it checks if the conditions specified by `func_1` are met using the sums of the numbers in each group. If the conditions are met, the function returns 'YES' along with the final values of `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. If the conditions are not met, the function returns 'NO'. **
