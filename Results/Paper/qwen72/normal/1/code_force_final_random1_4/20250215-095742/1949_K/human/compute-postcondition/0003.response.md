To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the object in the loop head, which is the list `numbers`.

Given:
- `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.
- The loop iterates over each element in `numbers`.

For the loop to execute, `numbers` must contain at least one element. Since the problem states that `n` is a positive integer and `numbers` is a list of `n` elements, `numbers` will always have at least one element as long as `n` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `numbers` is not empty, which is guaranteed by the condition that `n` is a positive integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order where 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are all 0, and `num` is the first element in `numbers`**
