The only object in the loop head is the variable `c` and the variable `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `c` should start at 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9; `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0; `c` is 0**
