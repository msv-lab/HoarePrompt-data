Output State: **`a` remains a list of strings with any number of elements, `y` is `max_p - 1`, `b` is a non-empty collection, `b_values` contains the integer values of all elements in `b` appended to its existing values, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` must be greater than 0, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` for each iteration of the loop plus `a_values[y]`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, `nf`, `a_values`) retain their original values and relationships as described in the initial state. Additionally, `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
