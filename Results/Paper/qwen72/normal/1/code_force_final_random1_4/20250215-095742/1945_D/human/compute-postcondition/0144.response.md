To determine what will be printed by the `print(best)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` retain their initial values.
   - `v` will be -1 after the loop (since it decrements from `na_frente` down to -1).
   - `total` will be the sum of the minimum costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0, considering the conditions within the loop.
   - `best` will be the minimum value between its initial value (10^12) and the sum of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` that satisfies `v <= pos_final`.

2. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates from `na_frente` down to 0.
   - For each `v`, it calculates the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` and adds this to `total`.
   - After the loop, `total` contains the sum of these minimum costs.
   - The variable `best` is updated to be the minimum value between its initial value (10^12) and the sum of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` that satisfies `v <= pos_final`.

3. **Final Value of `best`:**
   - Since `best` is initially set to a very large value (10^12), the final value of `best` will be the minimum of this large value and the sum of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` that satisfies `v <= pos_final`.
   - Therefore, `best` will be the smallest possible cost calculated during the loop.

Given this analysis, the `print(best)` statement will output the minimum cost calculated based on the conditions described.

Output: **best (where best is the minimum value between 10^12 and the sum of total plus custo_pra_trocar_a[v] for any v that satisfies v <= pos_final)**
