The value of `y`, which is the first element in the list `a`, is converted to an integer and appended to the list `a_values`. The list `a` remains unchanged, and `y` still holds the first element of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element, `y` is the first element in the list `a`, `a_values` contains the integer value of `y` appended to it.**
