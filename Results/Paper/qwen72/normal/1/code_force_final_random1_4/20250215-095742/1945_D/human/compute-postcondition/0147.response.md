Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost required to move from a starting position to a final position, considering two types of costs: the cost to change positions (`a_i`) and the cost to pass through positions (`b_i`). The function prints the minimum cost for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function retains the initial values of the input parameters and any variables used within the loop are reset for each new test case. The final state of the program includes the printed results for each test case and the input variables remain unchanged. **
