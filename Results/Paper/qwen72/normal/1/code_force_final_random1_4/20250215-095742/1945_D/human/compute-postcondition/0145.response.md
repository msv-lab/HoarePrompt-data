Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `cases` retain their initial values. The variable `c` will be equal to `cases`, indicating that the loop has run the number of times specified by `cases`. The variables `na_frente` and `pos_final` will be one less than their initial values for each iteration, but since they are reset for each new test case, their final values depend on the last test case's inputs. The lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` will retain the values provided by the user for each test case. The variable `total` will be the sum of the minimum costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0, considering the conditions within the loop. The variable `best` will be the minimum value between its initial value (10^12) and the sum of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` that satisfies `v <= pos_final`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `cases` remain unchanged from their initial values.
- The loop counter `c` will be equal to `cases`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- For each test case, `na_frente` and `pos_final` are adjusted based on the input values, but they are reset for each new test case.
- The lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` retain the values provided by the user for each test case.
- The variable `total` accumulates the minimum costs for each valid `v` from `na_frente` down to 0.
- The variable `best` stores the minimum cost found during the loop, which is the smallest value between the initial `best` (10^12) and the sum of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` that satisfies `v <= pos_final`.
