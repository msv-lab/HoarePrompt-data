Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `a` is a list of strings with any number of elements, `y` is the last element in the list `a`, and `a_values` contains the integer values of all elements in `a` appended to it. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `i`, `x`, `nf`, `b_values`, `b`, `custo`) retain their original values and relationships as described in the initial state.
Code of the loop:
for y in b:
    b_values.append(int(y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of strings with any number of elements, `y` is the first element in the list `b`, `b` must be a non-empty collection, `b_values` now contains the integer value of `y` appended to its existing values, all other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `i`, `x`, `nf`, `custo`, `a_values`) retain their original values and relationships as described in the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of strings with any number of elements, `y` is the second element in the list `b`, `b` must be a non-empty collection with at least 2 elements, `b_values` now contains the integer value of the first element of `b` and the integer value of the second element of `b` appended to its existing values, all other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `i`, `x`, `nf`, `custo`, `a_values`) retain their original values and relationships as described in the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of strings with any number of elements, `y` is the third element in the list `b`, `b` must be a non-empty collection with at least 3 elements, `b_values` now contains the integer value of the first element of `b`, the integer value of the second element of `b`, the integer value of the third element of `b`, and the integer value of the third element of `b` appended again, all other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `i`, `x`, `nf`, `custo`, `a_values`) retain their original values and relationships as described in the initial state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
