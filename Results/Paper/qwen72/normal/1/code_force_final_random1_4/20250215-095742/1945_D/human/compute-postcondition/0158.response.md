Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `a` is a list of strings with any number of elements, `y` is the last element in the list `a`, and `a_values` contains the integer values of all elements in `a` appended to it. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `i`, `x`, `nf`, `b_values`, `b`, `custo`) retain their original values and relationships as described in the initial state.**
