You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    custos = []
    for i in range(x):
        custo = 0
        
        num_fila = 0
        
        max_p = 0
        
        a_values = []

        for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
            if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
                custo += b_values[y]
                if y == 1:
                    custo += a_values[0]
                    break
            else:
                custo += a_values[y]

    #State: After all iterations of the loop have completed, the list `custos` will contain the final cost values for each of the `x` test cases, with each value being the result of the cost calculation performed within the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, and `i` will retain their values as they were at the start of each iteration, but `i` will have reached the value `x-1` (the last index of the loop). The variable `custo` will be reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration and will hold the final cost for the current test case at the end of each iteration. The lists `a_values` and `b_values` will be populated with the integer values from the input lists `a` and `b` for each test case, but these lists will be reinitialized for each new test case. The input variables `nf`, `a`, and `b` will be read from user input for each test case, and their values will be used to update `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, and `b_values` accordingly.
    for c in custos:
        print(c)
        
    #State: `custos` is a list that contains the final cost values for each of the `x` test cases, where `x` is the total number of iterations. Each element in `custos` represents the cost calculated during one iteration of the loop. The loop has printed each of these cost values exactly once.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of people in a queue (n), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (m), and two lists of integers (a and b). It returns a result for each test case.
