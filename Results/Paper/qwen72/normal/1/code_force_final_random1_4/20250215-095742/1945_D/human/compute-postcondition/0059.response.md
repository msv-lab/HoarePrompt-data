To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `v`, `na_frente`, and the range parameters. The loop iterates from `na_frente` down to `-1` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `na_frente` is decreased by 1, which means its value is some integer minus 1. For the loop to execute at least once, `na_frente` must be at least 0 after being decreased by 1. Therefore, the original value of `na_frente` must be at least 1.
- `v` will take on values starting from the current `na_frente` down to `-1`.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes at least once:
- `na_frente` must be at least 1 before the loop starts, so that after being decreased by 1, it is at least 0.
- `v` will start at `na_frente - 1` and go down to `-1`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `total` is 0, `best` is 10^12**.
