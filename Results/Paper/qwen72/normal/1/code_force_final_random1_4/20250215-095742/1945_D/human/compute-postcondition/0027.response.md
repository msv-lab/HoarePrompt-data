The code snippet assigns the value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to the variable `best`. Given that `v` is -1, this means `best` will be assigned the value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `best` is assigned the value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is 0, `pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the user, `v` is -1, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`, and the loop has terminated.**
