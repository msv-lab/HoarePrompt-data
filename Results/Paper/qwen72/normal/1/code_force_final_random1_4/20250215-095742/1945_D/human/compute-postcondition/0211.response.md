The only object in the loop head is the variable `c` and the list `custos`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `custos`. If the list `custos` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `c` will take the value of the first element in the list `custos` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`custos` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `c` is the first element in the list `custos`**
