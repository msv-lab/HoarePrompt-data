To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `a` is a list of strings with any number of elements.
- `y` is the last element in the list `b`.
- `b` must be a non-empty collection.
- `b_values` now contains the integer values of all elements in `b` appended to its existing values.
- `num_fila` must be greater than `max_p`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, `nf`, `a_values`) retain their original values and relationships as described in the initial state.
- If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, `custo` is updated to `custo + a_values[y]`.
- Otherwise, if `a_values[y]` is greater than or equal to `b_values[y]`, `custo` is updated to `custo + b_values[y]`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1` in reverse order.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1, and it must still be within the range defined by `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`.

### Adjustments:
- `y` must be decremented by 1.
- `num_fila` and `max_p` must remain such that `y` is still within the valid range.

### Updated State:
- `y` is now `y - 1`.
- `num_fila` must still be greater than `max_p`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` is a list of strings with any number of elements, `y` is the second-to-last element in the list `b`, `b` must be a non-empty collection, `b_values` now contains the integer values of all elements in `b` appended to its existing values, `num_fila` must be greater than `max_p`, all other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, `nf`, `a_values`) retain their original values and relationships as described in the initial state. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, `custo` is updated to `custo + a_values[y]`. Otherwise, if `a_values[y]` is greater than or equal to `b_values[y]`, `custo` is updated to `custo + b_values[y]`.**
