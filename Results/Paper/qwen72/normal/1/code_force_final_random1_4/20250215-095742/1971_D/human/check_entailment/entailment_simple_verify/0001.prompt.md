You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single parameter `s` which is a binary string (a string consisting of characters '0' and '1') with a length of 1 to 500 characters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `s` is a new input string with any length greater than 1, `t` is 0 (since the loop has completed all iterations), `i` is `t-1` (which is the final value of `i` after the last iteration), `j` is `len(s) - 1` (indicating the loop has processed the entire string `s`), `count` is the number of adjacent pairs in `s` where the characters are different, and `flag` is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent characters in `s` where the first character is '0' and the second character is '1'. If `flag` is True, `count` is the number of adjacent pairs in `s` where the characters are different minus 1.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine the minimum number of pieces a binary string needs to be cut into so that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (i.e., all '0's come before all '1's).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `count` to 1, which represents the minimum number of pieces.
   - It uses a flag `flag` to track if there is a transition from '0' to '1'.
   - It iterates through the string `s` using a while loop.
   - If consecutive characters are different (`s[j] != s[j + 1]`), it increments `count`.
   - If the transition is from '0' to '1', it sets `flag` to `True`.
   - After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `count`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Initialization**: `count` is initialized to 1, which is correct because even a single piece is a valid solution.
   - **Transition Handling**: The algorithm correctly identifies transitions between different characters and increments `count` accordingly.
   - **Special Case Handling**: If there is a transition from '0' to '1', the algorithm correctly adjusts `count` by decrementing it by 1. This is necessary because the transition itself does not require an additional piece beyond the initial count.
   - **Output**: The final `count` is printed, which should be the minimum number of pieces required.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - For `11010`, the algorithm correctly identifies 3 pieces: `11`, `0`, `10`.
   - For `00000000`, the algorithm correctly identifies 1 piece: `00000000`.
   - For `1`, the algorithm correctly identifies 1 piece: `1`.
   - For `10`, the algorithm correctly identifies 2 pieces: `1`, `0`.
   - For `0001111`, the algorithm correctly identifies 1 piece: `0001111`.
   - For `0110`, the algorithm correctly identifies 2 pieces: `011`, `0`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all edge cases and test cases correctly.
