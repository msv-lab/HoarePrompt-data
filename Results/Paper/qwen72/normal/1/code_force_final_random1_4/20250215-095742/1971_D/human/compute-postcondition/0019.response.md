Output State: **`s` is a new input string with length greater than 2, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, `count` is 3. If `s[0]` is '0' and `s[1]` is '1', `flag` is True. If `s[1]` (which is `s[j-1]`) is '0' and `s[2]` (which is `s[j]`) is '1', `flag` remains True. Otherwise, `flag` remains False.**
