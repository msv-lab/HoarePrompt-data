The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it into an integer, assigning this integer value to the variable `t`. This operation does not affect the initial state of the parameter `s`, which remains a binary string of length 1 to 500 characters.

Output State: **`s` is a binary string of length 1 to 500 characters, `t` is an input integer.**
