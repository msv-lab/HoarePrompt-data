The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value returned by `int(sys.stdin.readline())` and the current value of `_`. At the end of the last iteration, the number of sets of input data is greater than 0, `_` is 1, and the function `solve()` has been called.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and the total number of iterations (determined by the initial value from `int(sys.stdin.readline())`) must be greater than the current value of `_`.

Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, `_` becomes 2. For the loop to continue, the number of sets of input data (initially read from `sys.stdin.readline()`) must be greater than 2.

State: **The number of sets of input data is greater than 2, `_` is 2, and the function `solve()` has been called.**
