The function `solve()` is called, which does not modify the variables explicitly mentioned in the initial state (`_` and the number of sets of input data). Since no changes to these variables are specified within the given code snippet, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **The number of sets of input data (read from `sys.stdin.readline()` and converted to an integer) must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, and the function `solve()` has been called.**
