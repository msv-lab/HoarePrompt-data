Output State: **The number of sets of input data is equal to the integer value read from `sys.stdin.readline()`, `_` is equal to this integer value minus 1, and the function `solve()` has been called this many times.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the loop has run as many times as specified by the number of sets of input data. The variable `_` will be one less than this number because it starts from 0 and increments with each iteration. The function `solve()` will have been called exactly the same number of times as the number of sets of input data.
