The code snippet provided calls the function `solve()`. Since the function `solve()` has been called, and there's no additional information about what `solve()` does or returns, we can only infer that the function has been executed. The initial state specifies that the number of sets of input data must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, and the function `solve()` has been called.

If `solve()` does not modify any global variables or return a value, the state of the variables remains unchanged. However, since the function has been called, it is part of the output state.

Output State: **The number of sets of input data is greater than 0, `_` is 1, and the function `solve()` has been called.**
