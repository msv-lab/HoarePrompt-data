The function `solve` accepts parameters including the number of vertices `n`, the number of edges to remove `k`, and a list of edges represented as pairs of integers `(v, u)`. The constraints are \(1 \le k < n \le 10^5\) and \(1 \le v, u \le n\). The function processes these inputs to determine the result based on the given constraints and relationships.
