Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided solution does not correctly handle all the cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Even Dimensions**: The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0` is incorrect. If both dimensions are even, it is always possible to form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. However, the program prints 'yes' in this case, which is correct, but the logic is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Conditions for Odd Dimensions**: The conditions `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` and `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` are not logically sound and do not correctly determine whether another rectangle can be formed.

3. **Simplified Correct Logic**: To determine if another rectangle can be formed, we need to check if at least one of the dimensions is even. If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, it is impossible to form another rectangle.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version checks if at least one of the dimensions is even and prints 'yes' if so, otherwise it prints 'no'. This logic correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement.
