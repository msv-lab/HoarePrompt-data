Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, `i` is 0, and the input provided must be a positive integer greater than 0. `a` and `b` are now assigned the values from the input split by space. Either `a` is odd or `b` is odd. Additionally, neither `(a - b == -a, a)` nor `(b - a == -b, b)` holds true.**
