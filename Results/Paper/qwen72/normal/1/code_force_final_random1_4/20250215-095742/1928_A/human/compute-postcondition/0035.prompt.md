You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. The variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1`. For each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` were read from the input, and based on the conditions in the loop, the program printed 'yes' or 'no' accordingly. After the loop completes, the final values of `a` and `b` will be the ones from the last iteration, but these values are not retained for further use outside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, `a` and `b` are positive integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
