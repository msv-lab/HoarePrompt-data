To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. **Variable `i`:** This variable is initialized by the `range` function and will start from 0 by default.
2. **Result of `int(input())`:** This determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, this value must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.

The loop will execute based on the input provided by `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `i` is 0 (default initialization by `range`).
- The input provided must be a positive integer greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, `i` is 0, and the input provided must be a positive integer greater than 0**.
