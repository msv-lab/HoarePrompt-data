Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
2. `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
3. `i` is 0.
4. The input provided must be a positive integer greater than 0.
5. `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split by space.
6. Either `a` is odd or `b` is odd.
7. Either `a - b == -a` and `a` is the current value, or `b - a == -b` and `b` is the current value.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the implications:

- Since `a` and `b` are assigned from the input, they are positive integers.
- One of them must be odd.
- The conditions `a - b == -a` and `b - a == -b` imply specific relationships between `a` and `b`.

### Analyzing the Conditions:
- If `a - b == -a`, then `a + a = b` or `2a = b`.
- If `b - a == -b`, then `b + b = a` or `2b = a`.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **Scenario 1: `a` is odd and `2a = b`**
   - If `a` is odd, then `b` must be even (since `2a` is always even).
   - This contradicts the condition that either `a` or `b` is odd, because both cannot be true simultaneously.

2. **Scenario 2: `b` is odd and `2b = a`**
   - If `b` is odd, then `a` must be even (since `2b` is always even).
   - This also contradicts the condition that either `a` or `b` is odd, because both cannot be true simultaneously.

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions, it is impossible for both `a` and `b` to satisfy the given constraints simultaneously. Therefore, the code will always execute the `print('no')` statement.

Output: **no**
