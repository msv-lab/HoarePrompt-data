Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and `i` is 0. The input provided must be a positive integer greater than 0, and `a` and `b` are now assigned the values from the input split by space. If both `a` and `b` are even, then they remain as assigned. If either `a` or `b` is odd, then the condition `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` may hold true, or neither may hold true, and the difference `(a - b)` is either odd or even.***
