Functionality: ** The function reads a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `a` and `b`. It then checks if at least one of `a` or `b` is even. If so, it further checks if `a // 2` is not equal to `b` or if `b // 2` is not equal to `a`. If either condition is true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it directly prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution. **
