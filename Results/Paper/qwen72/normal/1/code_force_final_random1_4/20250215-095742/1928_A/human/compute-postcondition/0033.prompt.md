Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
        print('yes')
    elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
        print('no')
    elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and `i` is 0. The input provided must be a positive integer greater than 0, and `a` and `b` are now assigned the values from the input split by space. If both `a` and `b` are even, then they remain as assigned. If either `a` or `b` is odd, then the condition `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` may hold true, or neither may hold true, and the difference `(a - b)` is either odd or even.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user input such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and `i` is 1. If both `a` and `b` are even, the program does nothing. If either `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is true, or if `(a - b) % 2` is not equal to 0, the program also does nothing.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user input such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and `i` is 2. If both `a` and `b` are even, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the new values provided by the user input. If either `a` or `b` is odd, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the new values provided by the user input, and the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged regardless of the conditions `(a - b == -a, a)`, `(b - a == -b, b)`, or `(a - b) % 2` being true or false.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
