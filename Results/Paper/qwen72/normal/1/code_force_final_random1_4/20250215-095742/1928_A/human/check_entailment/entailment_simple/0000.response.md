Reasoning:

The logic in the given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **First Condition (`if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`)**:
   - This condition checks if both dimensions `a` and `b` are even. If both are even, it prints 'yes'. This is correct because an even-by-even rectangle can always be cut into two smaller rectangles and recombined to form a different rectangle (e.g., a 4x6 rectangle can be cut into two 4x3 rectangles and recombined to form a 6x4 rectangle).

2. **Second Condition (`elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`)**:
   - This condition is incorrect. It checks if `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)`, which is a tuple comparison and does not make sense in this context. The intended logic is unclear, and this condition will never be true for any valid input.

3. **Third Condition (`elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`)**:
   - This condition checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd. If the difference is odd, it prints 'yes'. This is incorrect because the parity of the difference between `a` and `b` does not determine whether a different rectangle can be formed. For example, a 3x2 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles and recombined to form a 1x6 rectangle, but the difference (3 - 2 = 1) is odd.

4. **Else Condition (`else`)**:
   - This condition catches all other cases and prints 'no'. However, it is not correctly handling all possible cases where a different rectangle can be formed.

### Correct Logic:
To determine if Bob can form a different rectangle, we need to check if at least one of the dimensions is even. If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and recombine them to form a different rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, no different rectangle can be formed.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the conditions for forming a different rectangle. The corrected program checks if at least one dimension is even, which is the correct approach.

Correctness: **False**
