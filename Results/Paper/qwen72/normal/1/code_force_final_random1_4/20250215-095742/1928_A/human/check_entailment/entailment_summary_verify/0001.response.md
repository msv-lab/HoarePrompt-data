### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary in detail to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Input Handling:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

#### Conditions:
1. **Condition 1:** `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`
   - This condition checks if both `a` and `b` are even. If both are even, Bob can always form another rectangle by cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. This is correct.

2. **Condition 2:** `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`
   - This condition is incorrect. The expression `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are tuples, not boolean expressions. The intended logic seems to be checking if `a` or `b` is 1, but this is not the correct way to express it. The correct check should be `a == 1 or b == 1`.

3. **Condition 3:** `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`
   - This condition is also incorrect. It checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, but it does not correctly handle all cases where Bob can form another rectangle. Specifically, it should check if either `a` or `b` is greater than 1 and the product of the dimensions is not a prime number.

4. **Else:** `else`
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'no'. However, the conditions above are not correctly formulated, leading to incorrect results.

#### Correct Logic:
- Bob can form another rectangle if at least one of the dimensions (`a` or `b`) is greater than 1 and the product of the dimensions is not a prime number.
- Specifically, if either `a` or `b` is 1, Bob cannot form another rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are greater than 1, Bob can always form another rectangle by cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1 or b == 1:
            print('no')
        else:
            print('yes')
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the given program is incorrect. The conditions in the original program do not correctly handle the logic required to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. The corrected program checks if either dimension is 1 and prints 'no' in that case, otherwise it prints 'yes'.

Final: **False**
