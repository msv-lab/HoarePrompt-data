Based on the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`).
   - `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.
   - If `a` is even, `a1` is set to `a // 2`, and `a2` is also set to `a // 2`.
   - `b1` is set to `b // 2`, and `b2` is set to `b // 2`.
   - If `a1` is not equal to `b`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('Yes')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print('Yes')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`.
   - The conditions and variable assignments described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement. The print statement will execute regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The print statement will always print the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
