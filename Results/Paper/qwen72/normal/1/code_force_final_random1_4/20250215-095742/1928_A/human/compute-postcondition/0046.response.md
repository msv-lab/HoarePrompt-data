Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input. If `a` is even, `a1` is set to `a // 2`, and `a2` is also set to `a // 2`. `b1` is set to `b // 2`, and `b2` is set to `b // 2`. If `a1` is not equal to `b`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop.** 

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop. No variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, so the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` remain unchanged. The conditions and values from the initial state are still valid.
