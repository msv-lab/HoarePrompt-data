### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Input Handling:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

#### Conditions:
1. **Condition 1:** `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`
   - This condition checks if both `a` and `b` are even. If both are even, Bob can always form another rectangle by cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. This is correct.

2. **Condition 2:** `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`
   - This condition is indeed incorrect. The expression `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are tuples and do not serve as logical conditions. The intended check should be whether `a` or `b` is 1. The correct condition should be `elif a == 1 or b == 1`.

3. **Condition 3:** `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`
   - This condition is also incorrect. The expression `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is always true because the remainder of any integer division by 2 is either 0 or 1. This condition does not correctly handle the cases where Bob can form another rectangle.

4. **Else:** `else`
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'no'. However, this is not the correct logic for determining if Bob can form another rectangle.

#### Correct Logic:
- Bob can form another rectangle if at least one of the dimensions (`a` or `b`) is greater than 1 and the product of the dimensions is not a prime number.
- Specifically, if either `a` or `b` is 1, Bob cannot form another rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are greater than 1, Bob can always form another rectangle by cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1 or b == 1:
            print('no')
        else:
            print('yes')
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified the issues with the given program and provided a corrected version. The given program is indeed incorrect because it does not correctly handle the conditions for forming another rectangle. The corrected program checks if either dimension is 1 and prints 'no' in that case, otherwise it prints 'yes'.

Final: **False**
