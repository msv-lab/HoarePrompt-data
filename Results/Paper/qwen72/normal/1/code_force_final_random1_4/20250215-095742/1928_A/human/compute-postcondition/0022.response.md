Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user input such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and `i` is 1. If either `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is true, the program does nothing. Otherwise, if `(a - b) % 2` is not equal to 0, the program also does nothing.***
