Based on the initial state and the conditions provided:

- `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` and `b` are positive integers within the range 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- The input provided is a positive integer greater than 0, and `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split by space.
- Either `a` is odd or `b` is odd.
- Neither `(a - b == -a, a)` nor `(b - a == -b, b)` holds true.
- The difference `(a - b)` is even.

Given these conditions, the `print('no')` statement will simply print the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
