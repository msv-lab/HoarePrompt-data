- The algorithm ensures that \(k\) and \(best\) are chosen such that \(p_k \oplus p_{best}\) is maximized.
   - The query count is within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the algorithm to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, and it stays within the query limit.
