### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can make up to \(3n\) queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in the permutation.

2. **Algorithm Overview:**
   - The algorithm uses a two-step approach to find the indices:
     1. **Step 1:** Find an index \(k\) such that \(p_k\) is likely to be one of the elements with a high value.
     2. **Step 2:** Find another index \(best\) such that \(p_k \oplus p_{best}\) is maximized.

3. **Step 1: Finding \(k\):**
   - Initialize \(k = 1\).
   - For each \(i\) from 2 to \(n-1\), compare \(p_0 \mid p_k\) with \(p_0 \mid p_i\).
   - If \(p_0 \mid p_i\) is greater, update \(k\) to \(i\).
   - This step ensures that \(k\) is an index where \(p_k\) is one of the larger values in the permutation.

4. **Step 2: Finding \(best\):**
   - Initialize \(best = 0\).
   - For each \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\), compare \(p_k \mid p_{best}\) with \(p_k \mid p_i\).
   - If \(p_k \mid p_i\) is greater, update \(best\) to \(i\).
   - This step ensures that \(best\) is an index where \(p_{best}\) is one of the values that, when XORed with \(p_k\), gives a high result.

5. **Output:**
   - After finding \(k\) and \(best\), output the indices \(k\) and \(best\) as the answer.

6. **Query Count:**
   - Step 1 makes \(n-2\) queries.
   - Step 2 makes \(n-1\) queries.
   - Total queries: \((n-2) + (n-1) = 2n - 3\), which is within the limit of \(3n\).

7. **Correctness:**
   - The algorithm ensures that \(k\) and \(best\) are chosen such that \(p_k \oplus p_{best}\) is maximized.
   - The query count is within the allowed limit.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:
