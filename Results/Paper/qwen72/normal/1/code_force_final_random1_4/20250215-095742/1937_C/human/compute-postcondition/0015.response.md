Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the print statement.
- `n` is greater than 4, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `i` is 4.
- `res` is an input string, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `k` is 3, regardless of the value of `res`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down the values being printed:
- `'?'` is a string literal.
- `0` is an integer.
- `k` is 3.
- `0` is another integer.
- `i` is 4.

So, the print statement will output the following values in the specified order, separated by spaces:
- `'?'`
- `0`
- `3`
- `0`
- `4`

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 3 0 4**
