Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the print statement).
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is set to `n`.
- `res` is the new input string.
- `k` is initially set to 1.
- `best` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<`. If no input was `<`, `best` remains 0.
- If `res` is `<`, then `k` is updated to `n-1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`?`**: This is a literal string.
2. **`0`**: This is a literal integer.
3. **`k`**: The value of `k` depends on the value of `res`:
   - If `res` is `<`, then `k` is updated to `n-1`.
   - Otherwise, `k` remains 1.
4. **`0`**: This is another literal integer.
5. **`i`**: `i` is set to `n`.

### Possible Values:
- If `res` is `<`, then `k` will be `n-1`.
- If `res` is not `<`, then `k` will be 1.
- `i` is always `n`.

### Final Output:
- If `res` is `<`, the print statement will output: `? 0 n-1 0 n`.
- If `res` is not `<`, the print statement will output: `? 0 1 0 n`.

### Conclusion:
Output: **? 0 [k] 0 [n]** (where `[k]` is `n-1` if `res` is `<`, otherwise `[k]` is 1, and `[n]` is the value of `n`).
