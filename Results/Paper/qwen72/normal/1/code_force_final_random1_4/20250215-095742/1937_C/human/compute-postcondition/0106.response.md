Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code snippet).
- `n` must be greater than 2 (this does not affect the print statement directly).
- `i` is 2.
- `res` is the new input string.
- If `res` is `<`, then:
  - `k` is set to 1.
  - `best` is set to 1.
- Otherwise, `k` and `best` retain their initial values, which are 1 and 0, respectively.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine the values of `k` and `best` based on `res`:**
   - If `res` is `<`, then `k` is 1 and `best` is 1.
   - If `res` is not `<`, then `k` is 1 and `best` is 0 (their initial values).

2. **Values of other variables:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `k` is 1 (either because it was set to 1 or it retained its initial value).

3. **Construct the output:**
   - The print statement will output the following:
     - `'?'` (a string literal)
     - `k` (which is 1)
     - `best` (which is either 1 or 0 depending on the value of `res`)
     - `k` (which is 1)
     - `i` (which is 2)

### Final Output:
- If `res` is `<`:
  - `k` is 1
  - `best` is 1
  - Output: **? 1 1 1 2**

- If `res` is not `<`:
  - `k` is 1
  - `best` is 0
  - Output: **? 1 0 1 2**

Since the initial state does not specify the value of `res`, we need to consider both cases. However, if we assume the most general case where `res` could be either `<` or something else, the output will be one of the two possibilities.

For the sake of providing a precise answer based on the given information:

Output: **? 1 [best] 1 2 (where [best] is 1 if res is '<', otherwise 0)**
