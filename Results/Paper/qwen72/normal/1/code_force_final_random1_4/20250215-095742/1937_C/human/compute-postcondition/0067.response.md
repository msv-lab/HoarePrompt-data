Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the print statement).
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `res` is the new input string.
- If `res` is `<`, then:
  - `k` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` if any input was `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1.
  - `best` is set to 1.
- If `res` is not `<`, then:
  - `k` remains 1.
  - `best` remains 0.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.

2. **Value of `k` and `best`:**
   - The value of `k` and `best` depends on the value of `res`.
   - If `res` is `<`:
     - `k` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<`. Since `i` is 2, `k` will be 2.
     - `best` is set to 1.
   - If `res` is not `<`:
     - `k` remains 1.
     - `best` remains 0.

### Possible Outputs:
- If `res` is `<`:
  - `k` is 2.
  - `best` is 1.
  - The print statement will output: `? 2 1 2 2`.

- If `res` is not `<`:
  - `k` is 1.
  - `best` is 0.
  - The print statement will output: `? 1 0 1 2`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both cases. However, the task requires us to determine what will be printed based on the given initial state.

Output: **? [k] [best] [k] 2 (where [k] is 2 if res is "<" and 1 otherwise, and [best] is 1 if res is "<" and 0 otherwise)**
