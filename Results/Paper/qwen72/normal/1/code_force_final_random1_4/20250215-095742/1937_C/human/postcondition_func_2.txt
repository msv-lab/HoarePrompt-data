The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` from the user, which represents the size of a permutation array, and ensures `n` is at least 2. If `n` is 2, it calls `func_2` with the arguments 0 and 1. For `n` greater than 2, it identifies the maximum and minimum indices in the permutation array using the `func_1` function, which compares elements in the array. Finally, it calls `func_2` with the identified maximum and minimum indices. The function does not return any value.
