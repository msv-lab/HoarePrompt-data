Let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

- `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the output.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `res` is the last input string, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `k` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<`. If no input was `<`, `k` remains 1.
- `best` is 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Given the initial state:
- `k` is 1 (since no input was `<`).
- `best` is 0.
- `i` is 1.

So, the values being printed are:
- `'?'` (a string literal)
- `k` (which is 1)
- `best` (which is 0)
- `k` (which is 1 again)
- `i` (which is 1)

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 1 0 1 1**
