The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, both within the range [0, n) where n is the size of a permutation `p`. It prints the string "! [a] [b]" to the standard output, where `[a]` and `[b]` are the values of the parameters. The function does not return any value. After the function executes, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the output printed to the console.
