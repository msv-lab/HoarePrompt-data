Let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

- `_` is a placeholder and not used in the print statement.
- `n` must be greater than 1, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `i` is 1.
- `res` is the last input string received from the loop, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `k` is the last index `i` for which the input was `<` if any input was `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1.
- `best` is 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Given the initial state:
- `k` is 1 (since no input was `<` or it remains 1).
- `best` is 0.
- `i` is 1.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **? 1 0 1 1**
