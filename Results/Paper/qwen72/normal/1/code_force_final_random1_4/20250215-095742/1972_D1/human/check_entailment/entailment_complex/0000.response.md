### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_15()` reads the values of `n` and `m` for each test case using `func_7()`.

2. **Logic of `func_15()`**:
   - The function calculates the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The logic involves iterating over possible values of `i` and updating the answer `ans` based on the condition `i * i <= n + i`.
   - The final result is `ans - 1`.

3. **Output**:
   - `func_16()` calls `func_15()` for each test case and prints the result.

### Analysis of `func_15()`:
- The function `func_15()` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.
- The loop condition `while i * i <= n + i` is not directly related to the problem statement, which requires checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- The calculation `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` does not seem to correctly implement the required condition.

### Conclusion:
The logic in `func_15()` does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The function should iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`, but it does not do so. Instead, it uses a different and incorrect approach.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
