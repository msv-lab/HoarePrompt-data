    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
    #The program returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` `rows_number` times, where `rows_number` is a non-negative integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` and returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` `rows_number` times. If `rows_number` is 0, the function returns an empty list.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `d` remains a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers. `da` is still an integer key present in `d`. The list `d[da]` has been fully processed. For each `di` in `d[da]`, if `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0, it has been temporarily set to 1 during the iteration, and `tmp` has been updated to the minimum of its previous value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. After each iteration, `processing[di - 1]` is reset to 0. The final value of `tmp` is the minimum value obtained from all calls to `func_12` for which `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. The `rank` list remains unchanged throughout the loop.

    #The program returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value obtained from all calls to `func_12` for which `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0, and `rank[da - 1]` is updated to this returned value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` takes a dictionary `d` mapping integers to lists of integers, a list `processing` of integers initialized to 0, an integer `da` which is a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers also initialized to 0. The function returns either 1 if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element, or the value of `tmp + 1` otherwise, where `tmp` is the minimum value obtained from recursive calls to `func_12` for elements in `d[da]` that have not been processed yet. Additionally, the function updates `rank[da - 1]` to the returned value. The `processing` list is used to track which elements have been processed during the recursive calls, but it is reset to its initial state before the function returns.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers where b >= 0.
def func_13(a, b):

    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns a tuple `(y, x - (a // b) * y, g)` where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the values returned by the function `func_13(b, a % b)`. Here, `y` is one of the values returned by `func_13`, `x - (a // b) * y` is calculated using the integer division of `a` by `b` and the value of `y`, and `g` is another value returned by `func_13`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` takes two integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is non-negative) as input and returns a tuple `(x, y, g)`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the arguments `(b, a % b)` and uses the results to compute and return a new tuple `(y, x - (a // b) * y, g)`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values returned by the recursive call. The final state of the program includes the returned tuple, which represents the extended Euclidean algorithm results for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.

    #State: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`. For each element `a[j]` in the list `a` where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`, if `a[j]` is less than `m`, then `k` is updated to `k - (m - a[j])`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.

        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`. For each element `a[j]` in the list `a` where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`, if `a[j]` is less than `m`, then `k` is updated to `k - (m - a[j])`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. Additionally, `k` is less than 0.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` representing the length of `a`, a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the list `a` and for each element that is less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and the element. After processing all elements, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function modifies the value of `k` based on the conditions described and returns either 1 or -1 depending on the final value of `k`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.

    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, updated by `func_7()`, `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(i^2 > n + i\), `ans` is the sum of \((n + k) // (k^2)\) for all integers \(k\) from 1 to \(i-1\) where \(i\) is the smallest integer such that \(i^2 > n + i\).
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of \((n + k) // (k^2)\) for all integers \(k\) from 1 to \(i-1\), and \(i\) is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(i^2 > n + i\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` takes no parameters and returns an integer value. It calculates and returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of \((n + k) // (k^2)\) for all integers \(k\) from 1 to \(i-1\). Here, \(i\) is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(i^2 > n + i\), and `n` is a positive integer updated by the function `func_7`. The function effectively computes a specific mathematical sum based on the updated value of `n` and returns the result decremented by 1.

def func_16():

    #State: The return value of `func_15()` is printed to the standard output for each iteration of the loop, and no variables are modified. The condition that `func_10()` must return a positive integer for the loop to execute remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It prints the result of calling `func_15()` to the standard output, once for each iteration of a loop that runs `func_10()` times. If `func_10()` returns 0 or a negative integer, nothing is printed. The function does not modify any external variables.
