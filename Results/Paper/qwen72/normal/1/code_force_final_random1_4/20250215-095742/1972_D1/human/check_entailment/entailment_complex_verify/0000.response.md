### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function `func_15`:**
     - This function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7()`.
     - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
     - It enters a loop that continues as long as \(i^2 \le n + i\).
     - Inside the loop, it updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\) and increments `i`.
     - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

   - **Function `func_16`:**
     - This function reads an integer \(t\) using `func_10()`, which represents the number of test cases.
     - It iterates \(t\) times, calling `func_15()` in each iteration and printing the result.

3. **Evaluation of `func_15`:**
   - The logic in `func_15` does not match the problem requirements. It calculates a sum based on a loop that increments `i` and checks a condition involving \(n\) and \(i\), but this is not related to finding pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\) is not checked anywhere in the function.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The function `func_15` is attempting to solve a different problem and does not match the problem statement.
   - Therefore, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
