Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, da is an integer key present in d, processing is a list of integers of the same length as the maximum value in d's keys, initialized to 0, rank is a list of integers of the same length as processing, initialized to 0, tmp is 1000000000, and the length of the list d[da] is greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
for di in d[da]:
    if processing[di - 1] == 0:
        processing[di - 1] = 1
        tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
        processing[di - 1] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `da` is an integer key present in `d`, `d[da]` is a list of integers with a length greater than 1, `di` is the first element in `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, `tmp` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `da` is an integer key present in `d`, `d[da]` is a list of integers with a length greater than 1, `di` is the second element in `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, `processing[di - 1]` remains 0, and `tmp` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. Otherwise, `processing[di - 1]` is not 0, and `tmp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `da` is an integer key present in `d`, `d[da]` is a list of integers with a length greater than 2, `di` is the third element in `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, `tmp` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. Otherwise, `processing[di - 1]` is not 0, and `tmp` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
