The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` representing the length of `a`, a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the list `a` and for each element that is less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and the element. After processing all elements, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function modifies the value of `k` based on the conditions described and returns either 1 or -1 depending on the final value of `k`.
