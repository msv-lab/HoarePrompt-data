To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is equal to `t`.
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 1 element.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]` and all other elements are `None`.
- `mex` is now equal to `t - ar[len(ar) - 1]`.
- `i` is `len(ar) - 1`.
- The condition `mex > mex - ar[i]` holds true, meaning `ar[i]` is a positive integer.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the list `ar` in reverse order, starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `len(ar) - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

### New State:
- `i` is now `len(ar) - 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `ar`, `res`, `mex`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]` and all other elements are `None`, `mex` is now equal to `t - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`**.
