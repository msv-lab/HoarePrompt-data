### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires reconstructing a permutation `p` from an array `a` where `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - The goal is to ensure that the reconstructed permutation `p` satisfies the given `a`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The algorithm reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes a result array `res` with `None` values.
   - It sets `mex` to `n`, which is the initial assumption that the MEX of the entire permutation is `n`.
   - It iterates through the array `a` in reverse order.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The key idea is to reconstruct `p` by working backwards from the end of the array `a`.
   - By setting `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`, we are effectively calculating the value of `p[i]` that would produce the given `a[i]`.
   - The update `mex = mex - ar[i]` ensures that the MEX is correctly adjusted as we move backwards through the array.
   - This approach ensures that the MEX calculation is consistent with the given `a` values.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The algorithm handles edge cases where `a` might have negative values or small positive values.
   - The initialization of `mex` to `n` ensures that the MEX is always within the valid range of the permutation.

5. **Output:**
   - The final result is printed as a space-separated string of the reconstructed permutation `p`.

### Validation Using Function Summary:
- The function summary indicates that `mex` starts as `n` and is updated to be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set `{n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))}`.
- The function iterates through the array `a` in reverse order, calculating `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]` and updating `mex` accordingly.
- This aligns with the problem's requirement to reconstruct the permutation `p` such that `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the given problem description. The logic and steps are sound and handle the constraints and requirements of the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
