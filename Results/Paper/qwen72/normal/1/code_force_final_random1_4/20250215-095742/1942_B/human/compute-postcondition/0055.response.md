The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `ar`, so we can only adjust these.

According to the code, the loop iterates over the indices of the list `ar` in reverse order, starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, meaning the loop has just processed the second-to-last element of `ar`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1 to point to the next (previous in the original list order) element, which would be `len(ar) - 3`. The loop condition is `i >= 0`, so as long as `i` is still non-negative, the loop will continue to execute.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be `len(ar) - 3`.
- The list `ar` remains unchanged and must have at least 1 element for the loop to potentially execute again.

State: **_ is 2, t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), n is an input integer, ar is a list of integers from the user input that must have at least 1 element, res is a list of n elements initialized to None except for the last element which is now mex - ar[-1] and the element at index i which is now mex - ar[i], i is len(ar) - 3. If mex > mex - ar[i], mex is updated to mex - ar[i].**
