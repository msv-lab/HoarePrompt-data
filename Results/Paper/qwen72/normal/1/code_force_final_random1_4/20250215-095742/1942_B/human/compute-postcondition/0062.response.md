The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function accepts two types of inputs: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function is expected to process these inputs according to the specified constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result for each test case, ensuring that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5, and that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data.**
