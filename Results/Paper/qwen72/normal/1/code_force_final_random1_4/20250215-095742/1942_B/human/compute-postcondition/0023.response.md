The provided Python code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `ar`. This impacts the value of `ar` while leaving the other variables unchanged.

- `ar` was initially described as a list of integers provided by the user, and now it is specifically set to the list of integers derived from the input.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `res`, `mex`, `i`) remain as they were in the initial state, with no changes applied to them by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element at index `i` (from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`) is `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` is the result of subtracting all elements of `ar` from `t` in reverse order, `i` is -1.**
