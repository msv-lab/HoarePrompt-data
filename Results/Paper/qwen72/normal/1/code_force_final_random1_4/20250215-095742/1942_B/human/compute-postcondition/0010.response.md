Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]` and all other elements are `None`, `mex` is now equal to `t - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, and the condition `mex > mex - ar[i]` holds true, meaning `ar[i]` is a positive integer.***
