Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element at index `i` (from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`) is `mex - ar[i]`, and `mex` is the result of subtracting all elements of `ar` from `t` in reverse order. The variable `i` is `-1` after the loop completes.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`_`**: Remains `0` as it is not used or modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains equal to `t` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`ar`**: Remains the same list of integers provided by the user, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`res`**: After the loop completes, `res` will contain the result of `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`. This means that `res` will have the values computed for each element in `ar` in reverse order.
- **`mex`**: After the loop completes, `mex` will be the result of subtracting all elements of `ar` from `t` in reverse order. This is because `mex` is updated in each iteration if the condition `mex > mex - ar[i]` holds true.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `-1` because the loop iterates from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`, and the final value of `i` will be one less than the last index, which is `-1`.
