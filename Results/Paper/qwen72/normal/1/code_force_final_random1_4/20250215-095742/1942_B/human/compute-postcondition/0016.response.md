The given code snippet updates the `res` list at the index `i` with the value `mex - ar[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `_` is 0
- `n` is equal to `t`
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 1 element
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]` and the element at index `len(ar) - 2` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, all other elements are `None`
- If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `t - ar[len(ar) - 1] - ar[len(ar) - 2]` and `i` is `len(ar) - 3`. Otherwise, the values of `mex` and `i` remain unchanged.

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. The code `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` updates the `res` list at the index `i` with the value `mex - ar[i]`.
2. The value of `i` is `len(ar) - 3` (as per the initial state).
3. The value of `mex` remains unchanged unless explicitly updated by the condition mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `_` is 0
- `n` is equal to `t`
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 1 element
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where:
  - The last element is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`
  - The element at index `len(ar) - 2` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`
  - The element at index `len(ar) - 3` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`
  - All other elements are `None`
- `mex` remains unchanged unless explicitly updated by the condition mentioned in the initial state
- `i` is `len(ar) - 3`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, the element at index `len(ar) - 2` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, the element at index `len(ar) - 3` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, and all other elements are `None`, `mex` remains unchanged unless explicitly updated by the condition mentioned in the initial state, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`.**
