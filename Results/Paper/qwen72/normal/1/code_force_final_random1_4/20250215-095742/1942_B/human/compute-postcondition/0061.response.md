Output State: **_ is t-1, t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), n is an input integer, ar is a list of integers from the user input, res is a list of n elements where each element at index i is `mex - ar[i]` for each i from 0 to len(ar) - 1, i is -1, and mex is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set {n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))}.**

Explanation:
- `_` is `t-1` because the loop runs `t` times, and the loop counter `_` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each time, reaching `t-1` on the last iteration.
- `t` remains an integer within the specified range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the input integer for the current test case.
- `ar` is the list of integers provided by the user for the current test case.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements, where each element at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]`.
- `i` is `-1` after the inner loop completes, as it iterates from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.
- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `{n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))}`, which is computed during the inner loop.
