Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers from the user input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None` except for the last element which is now `mex - ar[-1]`, `mex` is now `n - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, and the condition `(mex > mex - ar[i])` holds true, meaning `ar[i]` is positive.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.
- Since `mex` was initially `n`, the new value of `mex` is `n - ar[i]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
