Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element at index `i` (from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`) is `mex - ar[i]`, and `mex` is the result of subtracting all elements of `ar` from `t` in reverse order, `i` is -1.**
