Output State: **_ is 2, t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), n is an input integer, ar is a list of integers from the user input, res is a list of n elements where each element at index i is now `mex - ar[i]` for each i from 0 to len(ar) - 1, i is -1, and mex is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set {n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))}.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the list `ar` in reverse order, updating the `res` list and the `mex` value.
- For each iteration, the value at index `i` in `res` is set to `mex - ar[i]`.
- The `mex` value is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, which means `ar[i]` is positive.
- After all iterations, `i` will be -1 because the loop runs from `len(ar) - 1` down to 0.
- The final value of `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set of values `{n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))}`. This is because `mex` is continually reduced by the values in `ar` until it reaches a value that is no longer present in the set.
