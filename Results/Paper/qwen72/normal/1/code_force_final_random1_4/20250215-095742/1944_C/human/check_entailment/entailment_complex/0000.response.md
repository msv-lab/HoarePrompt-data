### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and deleting them.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the input, processes each test case, and calls the function `func_1` for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, a `Counter` object `nums` is created to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - A variable `start` is initialized to 0, and a set `vis` is used to keep track of visited integers.
   - The loop continues until `nums[start]` is 0, meaning the current integer `start` is no longer available in `arr`.
   - If `nums[start + 1]` is greater than 0, `start` is incremented, and the count of `start + 1` is decremented.
   - If `nums[start + 1]` is 0, the loop prints `start + 1` and returns, indicating the MEX of the array `c`.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice and Bob play optimally, so Alice will always try to pick the smallest available integer that maximizes the MEX, and Bob will try to pick the smallest available integer that minimizes the MEX.
   - The logic in the loop ensures that the smallest available integer is processed first, which aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when the array is empty or contains only one element.
   - The use of `Counter` and the loop ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated even for arrays with repeated elements.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The output of the program matches the expected results for the given test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. The use of `Counter` and the loop structure ensures that the MEX is calculated accurately.

**Correctness: **True****
