The code snippet `nums = c.Counter(arr)` creates a new variable `nums` that is a Counter object from the `collections` module (assuming `c` is an alias for `collections`). This Counter object counts the occurrences of each element in the list `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list `arr`.

After executing the code:
- `nums` is a Counter object that contains the count of each integer in `arr`.
- The structure of `nums` will be a dictionary-like object where the keys are the unique elements of `arr` and the values are the counts of these elements.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the counts of each integer in `arr`.**
