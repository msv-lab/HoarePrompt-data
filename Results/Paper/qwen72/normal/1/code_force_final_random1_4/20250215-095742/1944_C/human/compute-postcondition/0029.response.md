Output State: **The final state after all iterations of the loop is as follows: `arr` remains unchanged as it was initially. `nums` is a Counter object where the counts of the integers visited by `start` are decremented appropriately based on the loop's operations. Specifically, the count of each integer from 0 up to the last visited integer (inclusive) will be decremented by 1, and the count of the next integer (if it exists and was decremented) will also be decremented by 1. `start` will be the last integer that was successfully processed by the loop, which means `nums[start]` is 0 or `nums[start + 1]` is 0. `vis` will contain all the integers that were visited by `start` during the loop's execution.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to run as long as `nums.get(start, 0)` is non-zero.
- Each iteration of the loop adds `start` to the `vis` set, decrements `nums[start]` by 1, and checks if `nums[start + 1]` is non-zero.
- If `nums[start + 1]` is non-zero, it is decremented by 1, and `start` is incremented by 1.
- The loop terminates when `nums[start]` becomes zero or `nums[start + 1]` is zero, and the program prints `start + 1`.
- The final state of `nums` will reflect the decrements made during the loop's execution, and `vis` will contain all the integers that were visited by `start`.
