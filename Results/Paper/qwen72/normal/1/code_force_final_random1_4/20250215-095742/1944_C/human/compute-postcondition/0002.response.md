Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the counts of each integer in `arr`. `start` is 0. `vis` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new set `vis` which is initially empty. The other variables (`arr`, `nums`, and `start`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
