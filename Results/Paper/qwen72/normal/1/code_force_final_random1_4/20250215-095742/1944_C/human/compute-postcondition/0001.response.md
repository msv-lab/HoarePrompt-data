Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the counts of each integer in `arr`. `start` is 0.** 

The variable `start` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`arr` and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
