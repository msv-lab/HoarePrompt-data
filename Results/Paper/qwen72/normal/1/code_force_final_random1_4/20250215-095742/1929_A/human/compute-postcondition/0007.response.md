Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `ntest` must be greater than 1, `itest` is 1**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer. The input integer must satisfy the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `ntest`, `itest`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n` and retains the conditions of the other variables as specified in the initial state.
