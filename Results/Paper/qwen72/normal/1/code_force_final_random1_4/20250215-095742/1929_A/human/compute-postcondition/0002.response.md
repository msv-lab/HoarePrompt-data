Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ntest` must be greater than 0, `itest` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user, which must satisfy the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
