You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69

    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ntest` must be equal to the initial value of `ntest`, `itest` is `ntest - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function sorts the list of integers and then prints the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the sorted list. After processing all test cases, the function ends without returning any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the processed test cases, with the final value of `ntest` (the number of test cases) remaining unchanged, and `itest` being equal to `ntest - 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to maximize the "beauty" of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The goal is to find the maximum possible value of this sum.

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the beauty, we should try to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Sorting**: Sorting the array ensures that the largest and smallest elements are at the ends of the array.
   - **Difference Calculation**: The difference between the largest and smallest elements is indeed the maximum possible beauty for the array, as it represents the largest possible positive difference and the smallest possible negative difference.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: The problem specifies that \( n \geq 2 \), so this case is not applicable.
   - **All Elements Equal**: If all elements are equal, the difference will be zero, which is correct.
   - **General Case**: For any other array, the difference between the largest and smallest elements will be the maximum possible beauty.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
