Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to maximize the "beauty" of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The goal is to find the maximum possible value of this sum.

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the beauty, we should try to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Sorting**: Sorting the array ensures that the largest and smallest elements are at the ends of the array.
   - **Difference Calculation**: The difference between the largest and smallest elements is indeed the maximum possible beauty for the array, as it represents the largest possible positive difference and the smallest possible negative difference.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: The problem specifies that \( n \geq 2 \), so this case is not applicable.
   - **All Elements Equal**: If all elements are equal, the difference will be zero, which is correct.
   - **General Case**: For any other array, the difference between the largest and smallest elements will be the maximum possible beauty.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
