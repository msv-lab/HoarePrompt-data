Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an input integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `ntest` must be greater than 2.
- `itest` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: The list `a` is described as a sorted list of integers. This means the elements of `a` are in non-decreasing order.
2. **Length of `a`**: The length of `a` is not explicitly given, but since `n` is an input integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), it is reasonable to assume that the length of `a` is `n`.
3. **Accessing Elements**:
   - `a[0]` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `a[len(a) - 1]` is the last element of the list `a`.

### Calculation:
- The expression `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` calculates the difference between the last element and the first element of the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
- Since `a` is sorted, the first element `a[0]` is the smallest element, and the last element `a[len(a) - 1]` is the largest element.
- Therefore, `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` gives the range of the list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] (where a[len(a) - 1] is the largest element in the sorted list a and a[0] is the smallest element in the sorted list a)**

This output represents the range of the values in the sorted list `a`.
