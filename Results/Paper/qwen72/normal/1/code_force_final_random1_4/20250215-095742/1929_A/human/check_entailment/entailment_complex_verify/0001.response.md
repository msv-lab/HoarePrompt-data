Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to maximize the "beauty" of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The goal is to find the maximum possible value of this sum.

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the beauty, we need to consider the sum of differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The optimal strategy is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of differences. However, the given program only calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is not the same as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Sorting**: Sorting the array is a good step, but it is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly.
   - **Difference Calculation**: The difference between the largest and smallest elements is not the same as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. For example, for the array \([1, 2, 3]\), the correct beauty is \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2\), but the program would output \(3 - 1 = 2\), which is coincidentally correct in this specific case but not generally.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: Not applicable as \(n \geq 2\).
   - **All Elements Equal**: If all elements are equal, the difference will be zero, which is correct.
   - **General Case**: For any other array, the difference between the largest and smallest elements is not the correct beauty value.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The correct approach should involve calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Final: **False**
