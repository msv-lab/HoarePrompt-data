Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `q` is 0, `idx` has been incremented by `2 * q_initial + n + 1`, `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, followed by two additional empty strings, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]` before the loop started, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `a[1]` to `a[n]` is set to the corresponding integer value from `data[idx]` as the loop iterated, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `pf[1]` to `pf[n]` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where those `pf` values occur, and `i` is `n`.**
