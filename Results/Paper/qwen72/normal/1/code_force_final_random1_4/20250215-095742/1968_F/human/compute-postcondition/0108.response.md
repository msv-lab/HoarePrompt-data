Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and is greater than 0, `idx` is increased by `n + 3 * q + 4`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `a[1]` which is set to the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `a[2]` which is set to the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, and `a[3]` which is now set to the integer value of `data[idx]`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `pf[1]` which is set to the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and `pf[2]` which is now `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs `{(0): [0], (pf[1]): [1], (pf[2]): [2]}`, `i` is 3, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, and an additional empty string, `pf[1]` is now equal to the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`.**
