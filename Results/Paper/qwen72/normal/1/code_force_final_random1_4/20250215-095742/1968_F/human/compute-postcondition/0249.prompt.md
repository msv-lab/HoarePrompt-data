You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5; a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30; each query is represented by two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        q = int(data[idx + 1])
        
        idx += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            if pf[i] not in mp:
                mp[pf[i]] = []
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[idx])
            r = int(data[idx + 1])
            idx += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
            v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
            it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
        results.append('')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is 0, `idx` has been incremented by the total number of elements processed in `data` which is the sum of `n + 1 + 2 * q` for each test case, `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions checked within the loop, followed by an empty string for each test case. The variables `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` are no longer relevant as they are re-initialized in each iteration.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: (Each 'YES', 'NO', or empty string from the `results` list, each on a new line)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of elements `n`, the number of queries `q`, a list of integers `a`, and a set of queries `(l, r)`. For each query, the function returns a result based on the elements of the list `a` from index `l` to `r`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
