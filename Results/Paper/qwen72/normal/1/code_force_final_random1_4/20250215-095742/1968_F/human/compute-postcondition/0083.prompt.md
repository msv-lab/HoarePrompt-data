Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]` and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by `n + 1`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the integer value of `data[idx - (n - i + 1)]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, and the rest are zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, and the rest are zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where those values occur, and `i` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]` and is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` and is greater than 0, `idx` is increased by `n + 3`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the integer value of `data[idx - (n - i + 1)]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, and the rest are zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, and the rest are zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where those values occur, `i` is `n`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices where `pf[r]` occurs in `pf`, `v2` is the list of indices where `pf[l - 1]` occurs in `pf` or an empty list `[]` if `pf[l - 1]` is not found in `mp`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where the first element greater than or equal to `l` is located, `it2` is the index in `v2` where the last element less than `r` is located. If the condition `(it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l))` is true, `results` contains the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains the string 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`it2` is the index in `v2` where the last element less than `r` is located, or -1 if no such element exists. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is non-negative, and `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, then `results` contains one additional element, 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` has 'NO' appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`it2` is the index in `v2` where the last element less than `r` is located, or -1 if no such element exists. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is non-negative, and `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r` and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, then `results` now contains one additional element, which is the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` now includes 'NO' as its last element. All other variables remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
