Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index in `v2` just before the position where `r` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `r` is now the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, then `results` contains 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'NO'.**

Explanation:
- `idx` is increased by 2, so its new value is `idx + 2`.
- The value of `l` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 2]` because `idx` was increased by 2.
- The value of `r` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` because `idx` was increased by 2.
- All other variables (`q`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, and `results`) remain unchanged or are dependent on the updated values of `l` and `r`.
