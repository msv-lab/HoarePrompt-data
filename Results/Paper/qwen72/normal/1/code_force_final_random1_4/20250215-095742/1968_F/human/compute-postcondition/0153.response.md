Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index in `v2` just before the position where `r` would be inserted to maintain sorted order. `results` now includes 'YES' as its last element.** 

Explanation: The code appends 'YES' to the `results` list. All other variables (`q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) remain unchanged. The condition that was checked before appending 'YES' is no longer relevant as the code snippet only shows the append operation.
