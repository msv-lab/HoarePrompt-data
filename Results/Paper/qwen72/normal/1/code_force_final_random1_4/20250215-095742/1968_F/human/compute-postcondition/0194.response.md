Output State: **`q` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` has been incremented by `2 * q_initial + 5`, `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, followed by an additional empty string, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 3])`, `a[2]` which is now `int(data[idx - 2])`, and `a[3]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `pf[1]` is now `a[1]`, `pf[2]` is now `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `pf[3]` is now `pf[2] ^ a[3]`, `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs `{(0): [0], a[1]: [1], pf[2]: [2], pf[3]: [3, i]}` if `pf[3]` is in `mp`. If `pf[3]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[3]]` is `[3]`, and `i` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The line `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list associated with the key `pf[3]` in the dictionary `mp`.
- If `pf[3]` was already a key in `mp`, its list is updated to include 3, resulting in `mp[pf[3]]` being `[3, 3]`.
- If `pf[3]` was not already a key in `mp`, a new key-value pair is created with `pf[3]` as the key and `[3]` as the value.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
