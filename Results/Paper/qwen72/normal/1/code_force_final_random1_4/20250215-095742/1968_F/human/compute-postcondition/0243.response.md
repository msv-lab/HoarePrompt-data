Postcondition: ***`q` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is incremented by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index in `v2` where `r` would fit to maintain sorted order minus 1. If `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`, then `results` now includes 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` now includes 'NO'.***
