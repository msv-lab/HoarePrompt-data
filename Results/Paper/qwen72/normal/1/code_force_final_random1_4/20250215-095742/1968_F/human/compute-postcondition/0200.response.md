Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is calculated as the bitwise XOR (`^`) of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. The values of `q`, `l`, `r`, and `idx` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `idx` has been incremented by 2.
