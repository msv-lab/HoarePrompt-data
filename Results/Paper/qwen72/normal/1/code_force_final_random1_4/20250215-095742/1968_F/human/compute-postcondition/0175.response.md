Output State: **`q` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` has been incremented by `2 * q_initial + 3`, `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, followed by an additional empty string, `n` must be at least 0, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `pf[1]` is now `a[1]`, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{(0): [0]}`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` updates the value of `pf[1]` to be the result of `pf[0] ^ a[1]`.
- Since `i` is 1, `pf[0]` is 0 (as `pf` is initialized with zeros), and `a[1]` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, the value of `pf[1]` becomes `0 ^ a[1]`, which simplifies to `a[1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
