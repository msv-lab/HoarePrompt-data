You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

The variables `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` are no longer relevant as they are re-initialized in each iteration.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: (Each 'YES', 'NO', or empty string from the `results` list, each on a new line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines whether the XOR of the subarray from index `l` to `r` is zero or if there exists a pair of indices within the subarray that have the same prefix XOR value. If either condition is met, it appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all queries for all test cases, it prints the results, with each result on a new line, and an additional empty line after each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for determining if a subarray is interesting based on the problem description. It uses prefix XOR to efficiently compute the XOR of subarrays and a map to store indices of prefix XOR values. The program checks if the XOR of the subarray is zero or if there exist indices within the subarray that have the same prefix XOR value, which would allow the subarray to be split into parts with equal XOR. This approach covers all the requirements specified in the problem description, and no counterexample has been found where the program fails to produce the correct result.
