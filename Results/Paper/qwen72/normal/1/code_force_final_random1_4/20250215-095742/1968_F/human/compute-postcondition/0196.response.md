To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `_` and `q`. The loop will execute if `q` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, so it doesn't need to be initialized before the loop starts.

Given the state before the loop starts, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `q` is greater than 0. The other variables (`idx`, `results`, `n`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, and `i`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`q` must be greater than 0**
