Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `idx` is increased by 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is set to the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` and the rest are zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except `pf[1]` which is now `a[1]`, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{(0): [0], (a[1]): []}`, `i` is 1, and `pf[i]` is not in `mp` except for the key `(a[1])`.**
