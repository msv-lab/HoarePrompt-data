Postcondition: ***`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` is 0, 'YES' is appended to the list `results`, and the program skips the rest of the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.***
