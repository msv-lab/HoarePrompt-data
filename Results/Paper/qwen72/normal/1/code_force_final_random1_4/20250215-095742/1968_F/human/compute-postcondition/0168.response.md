Output State: **`q` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` has been incremented by `2 * q_initial + 2`, `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, followed by an additional empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is incremented by 2, so the new value of `idx` is `2 * q_initial + 2`.
- The values of `q`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
