Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, the current value of `x` is 0, and 'YES' is appended to the list `results`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.**
