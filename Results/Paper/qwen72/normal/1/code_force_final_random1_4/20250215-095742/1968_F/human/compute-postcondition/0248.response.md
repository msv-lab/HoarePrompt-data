The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving a list of integers and a series of queries on that list. The function accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer representing the length of the list, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
  - `q`: An integer representing the number of queries, where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30.
  - Each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r`, where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.

The function processes each test case and its associated queries, and for each query, it returns a result based on the elements of the list `a` from index `l` to `r`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of elements `n`, the number of queries `q`, a list of integers `a`, and a set of queries `(l, r)`. For each query, the function returns a result based on the elements of the list `a` from index `l` to `r`.**
