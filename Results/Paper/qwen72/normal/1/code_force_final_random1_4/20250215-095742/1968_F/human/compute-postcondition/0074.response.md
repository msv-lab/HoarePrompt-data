The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. This means that no changes are made to the variables or the state of the program beyond the immediate effect of skipping the remaining code in the loop body.

Given the initial state, the only change is that the program control moves to the next iteration of the loop without altering any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Output State: **`it2` is the index in `v2` where the last element less than `r` is located, or -1 if no such element exists. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is non-negative, and `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, then `results` contains one additional element, 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` has 'NO' appended to it. `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`. `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`. `idx` is increased by 2. `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. `results` now contains one more 'YES' element.**
