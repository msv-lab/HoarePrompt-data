Output State: **`q` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is incremented by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index in `v2` where `r` would fit to maintain sorted order minus 1, `results` now includes 'YES', `idx` is now `idx + 2`.** 

Explanation: The code appends 'YES' to the `results` list. All other variables (`q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) remain unchanged from their initial state, except for `idx` which is incremented by 2.
