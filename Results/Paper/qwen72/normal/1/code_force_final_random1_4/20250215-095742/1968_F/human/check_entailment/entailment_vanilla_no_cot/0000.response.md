Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for determining if a subarray is "interesting" based on the problem description. The key aspects of the solution are:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix XOR (`pf`) for the array `a`, which allows for efficient computation of the XOR of any subarray.
2. **Mapping Prefix XORs**: It maintains a mapping (`mp`) of prefix XOR values to their indices, which helps in quickly checking if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.
3. **Query Handling**: For each query, it checks if the XOR of the subarray is zero, which directly implies that the subarray is interesting. If not, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find if there are indices within the subarray that can form valid splits.

The logic and implementation seem to align well with the problem requirements, and the program should handle the constraints and edge cases effectively. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
