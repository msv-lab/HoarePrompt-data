The value of `idx` is incremented by 2, while the values of `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + 2`.
Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + 2`.**
