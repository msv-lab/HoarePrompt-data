Output State: **`v2` is now the list associated with the key `pf[l - 1]` in the dictionary `mp`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`. `v1` is the list associated with the key `pf[r]` in the dictionary `mp`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`. `it2` is the index in `v2` where the last element less than `r` is located, or -1 if no such element exists. `it1` is the index in `v1` where the first element greater than or equal to `l` is located. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is non-negative, and `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, then `results` contains one additional element, 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` has 'NO' appended to it. `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`. `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`. `idx` is increased by 2. `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` is 0, `results` now contains one more 'YES' element.**
