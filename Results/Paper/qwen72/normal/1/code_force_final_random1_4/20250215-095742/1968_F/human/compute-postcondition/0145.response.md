The code snippet `results.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains largely unchanged except for the modification to the `results` list.

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index in `v2` just before the position where `r` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `results` now includes 'YES'.**
