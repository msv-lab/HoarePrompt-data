Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.**

Explanation:
- The variable `pf` is initialized as a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `idx`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
