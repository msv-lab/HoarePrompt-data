Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `idx` is increased by 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is set to the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` and the rest are zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{(0): [0]}`, `i` is 1.** 

Explanation:
- `idx` was initially increased by 2, and now it is further increased by 1, making the total increase 3.
- The value of `n` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` because `idx` has been increased by 3.
- The value of `q` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 2]` because `idx` has been increased by 3.
- The value of `a[1]` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` because `idx` has been increased by 3.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
