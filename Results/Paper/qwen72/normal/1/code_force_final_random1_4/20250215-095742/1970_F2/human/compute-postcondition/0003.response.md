The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are integers. The function returns two values: the first value is the sum of `x` and `dx`, and the second value is the sum of `y` and `dy`. Since the values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy` are not specified, the exact numerical values of the returned results cannot be determined. However, the function's purpose is to compute and return these sums based on the unspecified values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns two values: the sum of `x` and `dx` as the first value, and the sum of `y` and `dy` as the second value.**
