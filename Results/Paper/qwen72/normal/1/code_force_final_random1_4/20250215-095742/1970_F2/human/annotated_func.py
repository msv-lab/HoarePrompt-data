#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`. Since `a` and `b` remain unchanged and there is no information about the values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`, the exact numerical values cannot be determined. However, the program attempts to return the sum of `x` and `dx` as the first value, and the sum of `y` and `dy` as the second value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be tuples of two integers each. It returns a tuple containing the sum of the first elements of `a` and `b` as the first value, and the sum of the second elements of `a` and `b` as the second value. The original values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
