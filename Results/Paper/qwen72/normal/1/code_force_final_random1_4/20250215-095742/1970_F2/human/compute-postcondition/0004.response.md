Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be tuples of two integers each. It returns a tuple containing the sum of the first elements of `a` and `b` as the first value, and the sum of the second elements of `a` and `b` as the second value. The original values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. **
