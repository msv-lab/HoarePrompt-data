Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
- The function `func_1` is defined at the end of the script but used before it is defined. This will cause a NameError when the script is run.
- The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be an assignment (`=`) instead of a comparison (`==`).
- The logic for checking if a player has scored a goal is flawed. The conditions `if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:` and `if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:` check if the player's position is in the list of goal positions, but this should also consider the team of the player. A player scoring in their own goal should award the point to the opposing team.
- The handling of the Quaffle's position after a goal is not consistent. After a goal, the Quaffle should always be reset to the middle of the field, regardless of which team scored.
- The script does not handle the case where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle correctly. The Quaffle should remain on the cell where the player was eliminated.
- The script does not handle the case where multiple players are eliminated at the same time in the correct order (alphabetical).

These issues need to be addressed to ensure the program functions correctly according to the problem description.
