The code snippet `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `b`.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers from user input.**
