The value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is 1, the element `a[1]` is used as the key in the dictionary `cnt_b`, and its corresponding value is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than `m`, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is incremented by 1.**
