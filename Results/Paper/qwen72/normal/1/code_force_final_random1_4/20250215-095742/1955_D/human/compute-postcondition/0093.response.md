The code snippet increments the value of `cnt_b[b[i]]` by 1. Given that `i` is 2, this means `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from a new input, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1.**
