Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from a new input, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences in `b` minus 1 for the element `a[0]`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0, the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is in the set `b_values`, and the value of `cnt_b[a[0]]` is greater than or equal to 0.**
