Postcondition: ***After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `m-1`, `m` remains the same as the input integer, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. `b_values` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `b`. For each `i` from 0 to `m-1`, if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 after decrementing, `curr` is incremented by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
