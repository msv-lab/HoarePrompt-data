The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the iterable `b_values`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `b_values` to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `n - m`, `n` is greater than `m`, and `b_values` must be a non-empty iterable. For the loop to execute one more time, `b_values` must still be a non-empty iterable, and `i` will take the value of the next element in `b_values`.

Since the exact value of the next element in `b_values` is not specified, we can only state that `i` will be the next element in `b_values`.

State: **`i` is the next element in `b_values`, `n` is greater than `m`, `b_values` must be a non-empty iterable, `cnt_b[i]` is `0`**
