The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `b_values`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `b_values`. If `b_values` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `b_values` must contain at least two elements, and `i` is the next element from `b_values`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b_values` must still contain at least one more element after the current `i` has been processed. Therefore, `b_values` must contain at least three elements in total, and `i` will be the next (third) element in the list.

State: **`b_values` must contain at least three elements, `i` is the next (third) element from `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.**
