The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer, indicating the number of iterations.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the lengths of arrays `a` and `b`, and the required number of matching elements.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6.
- `max_val` is 1000000.
- `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001, initialized with all elements set to 0.

To ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer, which should match the value of `t`.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `int(input())` must be equal to `t` for the loop to execute.**
