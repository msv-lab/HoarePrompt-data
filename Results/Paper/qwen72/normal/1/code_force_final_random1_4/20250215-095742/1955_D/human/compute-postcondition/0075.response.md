Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `n - m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`. The variable `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose count in `cnt_b` is non-negative after the loop has completed. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where this condition holds true. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n - m` because the loop runs from `0` to `n - m - 1`.
- **`curr`**: This variable tracks the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose count in `cnt_b` is non-negative. It is updated during each iteration based on the conditions in the loop.
- **`ans`**: This variable is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `curr` never meets this condition, `ans` remains 0.
- **Other Variables**: The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `b_values` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
