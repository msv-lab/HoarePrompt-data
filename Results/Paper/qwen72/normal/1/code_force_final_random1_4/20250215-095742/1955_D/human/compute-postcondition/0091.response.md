Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from a new input, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt_b[b[1]]` by 1 because `i` is 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
