The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`, and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - m`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n - m` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1.
- `n` must still be greater than `m` for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than `m`**
