The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `m` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1**
