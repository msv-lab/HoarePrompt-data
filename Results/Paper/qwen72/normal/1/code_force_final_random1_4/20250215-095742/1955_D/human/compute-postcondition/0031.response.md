Postcondition: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is 2, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is decreased by 1. If `cnt_b[a[2]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is 1 (or 2 depending on the initial value of `curr`).**
