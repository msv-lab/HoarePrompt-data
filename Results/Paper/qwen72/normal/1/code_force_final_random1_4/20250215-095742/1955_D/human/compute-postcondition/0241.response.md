To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `i` is `n - m - 1`, where `n` is greater than `m`.
2. `m` remains the same as the input integer.
3. `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`.
4. The values of `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
5. `b_values` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `b`.
6. For each `i` from 0 to `n - m - 1`:
   - If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.
   - If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0 after incrementing, `curr` is decreased by 1.
   - Otherwise, `cnt_b[a[i]]` remains unchanged and `curr` remains the same.
   - If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1.
   - If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` starts at `n - m - 1`.
   - `cnt_b` is initialized such that `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - m - 1`.
   - For each iteration:
     - Check if `a[i]` is in `b_values`.
     - If true, increment `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1.
     - If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0 after incrementing, decrease `curr` by 1.
     - Check if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`.
     - If true, decrement `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1.
     - If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, increase `curr` by 1.
     - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, increment `ans` by 1.

3. **Final Value of `ans`**:
   - The value of `ans` is determined by the number of times `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the final value of `ans`, which is the count of how many times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution.

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of how many times curr was greater than or equal to k during the loop execution)**
