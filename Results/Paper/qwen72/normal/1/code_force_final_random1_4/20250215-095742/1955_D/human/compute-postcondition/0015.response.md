Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `m-1`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `curr` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state, so their values remain unchanged. The new state includes the updated value of `curr`.
