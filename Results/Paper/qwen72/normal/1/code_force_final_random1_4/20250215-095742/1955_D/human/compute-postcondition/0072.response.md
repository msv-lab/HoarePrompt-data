Postcondition: ***`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than `2m`, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `m + 1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0 after decrementing, `curr` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, no changes are made to `cnt_b` or `curr`, and `ans` remains unchanged.***
