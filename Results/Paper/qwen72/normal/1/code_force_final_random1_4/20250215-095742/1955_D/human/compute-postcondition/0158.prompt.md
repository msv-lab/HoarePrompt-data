Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from a new input, `i` is `m-1`, `m` is the total number of iterations, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences in `b` minus the number of times the corresponding element in `a` has been encountered (but not less than 0), `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
            curr -= 1
    if a[i + m] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
            curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is greater than `m`. If the element at index 0 of list `a` is in the set `b_values`, the count of this element in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1. If the current value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. If the element at index `i + m` of list `a` is in the set `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1. If the element at index 0 of list `a` is not in the set `b_values`, no changes are made to `cnt_b` or `curr`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than `m`. If `a[1 + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1 + m]]` is decremented by 1. If `a[1]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[1]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. Additionally, if `cnt_b[a[1 + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1. If `a[1 + m]` is not in `b_values`, no changes are made to `cnt_b` or `curr`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than `m`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. If `a[2]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `cnt_b[a[2]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is less than 0, the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `curr` is increased by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
