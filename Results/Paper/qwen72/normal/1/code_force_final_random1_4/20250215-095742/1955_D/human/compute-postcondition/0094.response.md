Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from a new input, `i` is `m-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, for each index `j` from 0 to `m-1`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their initial values, which were assigned from the input.
- The list `a` remains unchanged, as it was read from the input.
- The list `b` also remains unchanged, as it was read from a new input.
- The loop variable `i` has reached the value `m-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration.
- The variable `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop has performed.
- For each element in the list `b` (from index 0 to `m-1`), the corresponding value in the dictionary `cnt_b` has been incremented by 1.
