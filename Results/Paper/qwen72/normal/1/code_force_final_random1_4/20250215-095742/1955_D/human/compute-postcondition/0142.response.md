Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than `m`, `cnt_b[a[1 + m]]` is decremented by 1, if `a[1]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, if `cnt_b[a[1]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1, `curr` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `curr` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. Therefore, the final state includes all the initial conditions plus the updated value of `curr`.
