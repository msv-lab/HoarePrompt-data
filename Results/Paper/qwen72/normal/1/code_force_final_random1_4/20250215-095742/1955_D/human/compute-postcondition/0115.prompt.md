Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from a new input, `i` is `m-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences in `b`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
            curr += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from a new input, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences in `b`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0. If `a[0]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[0]]` is decremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[0]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is set to 1. Otherwise, `curr` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from a new input, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences in `b`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0. If `a[0]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[0]]` is decremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[0]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is set to 1. Otherwise, `curr` remains 0. If `a[1]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[1]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is set to 1. Otherwise, `curr` remains 0 if `a[0]` was not in `b_values` or `cnt_b[a[0]]` was less than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from a new input, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences in `b`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0. If `a[0]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[0]]` is decremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[0]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is set to 1. Otherwise, `curr` remains 0. If `a[1]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[1]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is set to 1. Otherwise, `curr` remains 0 if `a[0]` was not in `b_values` or `cnt_b[a[0]]` was less than 0. If `a[2]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is decremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[2]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
