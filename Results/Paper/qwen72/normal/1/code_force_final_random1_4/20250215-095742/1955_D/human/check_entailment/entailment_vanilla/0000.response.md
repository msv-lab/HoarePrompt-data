### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` initializes a list `cnt_b` to keep track of the frequency of elements in `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Counting for Array `b`:**
   - The function iterates over the elements of `b` and increments the corresponding index in `cnt_b` to count the frequency of each element in `b`.
   - It also creates a set `b_values` to quickly check if an element in `a` is present in `b`.

3. **Initial Window Check:**
   - The function initializes a variable `curr` to count the number of matching elements in the initial window of size `m` in `a`.
   - It iterates over the first `m` elements of `a` and checks if each element is in `b_values`. If it is, it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is non-negative.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The function uses a sliding window approach to check each subsequent subarray of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new position, it updates the count of the element that is leaving the window and the element that is entering the window.
   - It adjusts `curr` accordingly and checks if the current window is good (i.e., `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`). If so, it increments `ans`.

5. **Resetting Frequency Counts:**
   - After processing each test case, the function resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to prepare for the next test case.

### Correctness:
- The logic correctly handles the sliding window approach to check each subarray of length `m` in `a`.
- It accurately counts the number of matching elements and updates the answer accordingly.
- The function resets the frequency counts for each test case, ensuring that the state is clean for the next test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
