The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts no direct parameters but expects input in the form of test cases, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b`. Here, `n` and `m` represent the lengths of the lists `a` and `b`, respectively, and `k` represents the required number of matching elements between the two lists. The function processes each test case to determine if there are at least `k` common elements between the lists `a` and `b`.

- For each test case:
  - If there are at least `k` common elements between `a` and `b`, the function returns "Yes" for that test case.
  - If there are fewer than `k` common elements, the function returns "No" for that test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b`. It returns "Yes" if there are at least `k` common elements between `a` and `b` for each test case, and "No" otherwise.**
