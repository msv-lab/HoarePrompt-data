Postcondition: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is 1, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0. If `a[1]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[1]]` is greater than or equal to 0 after decrementing, `curr` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `curr` remains 0. If `a[1]` is not in `b_values`, `curr` remains 0.**
