Postcondition: ***`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than `2m`, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1. `ans` is set to 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
