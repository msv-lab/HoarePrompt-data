### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function initializes `cnt_b` as a list of zeros with a size of `max_val + 1` to keep track of the frequency of elements in `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.

2. **Reading Test Case Data:**
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the elements of array `a` and array `b`.

3. **Counting Elements in `b`:**
   - It updates the `cnt_b` list to count the occurrences of each element in `b`.

4. **Initial Window Check:**
   - It initializes a variable `curr` to count the number of elements in the first window of size `m` of array `a` that match the elements in `b`.
   - It decrements the count in `cnt_b` for each element in the initial window and checks if the count is non-negative to update `curr`.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

5. **Sliding Window:**
   - It uses a sliding window approach to check all subarrays of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window, it updates `cnt_b` and `curr` accordingly.
   - For each element removed from the window, it also updates `cnt_b` and `curr` accordingly.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

6. **Resetting Counts:**
   - After processing each test case, it resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b` to zero.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the sliding window technique to count the number of good subarrays.
- It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.
- The logic for counting and updating the elements in the sliding window is correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
