### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function initializes `cnt_b` as a list of zeros with a size of `max_val + 1` to keep track of the frequency of elements in `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.

2. **Reading Test Case Data:**
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the elements of array `a` and array `b`.

3. **Counting Elements in `b`:**
   - It updates the `cnt_b` list to count the occurrences of each element in `b`.

4. **Initial Window Check:**
   - It initializes a variable `curr` to count the number of elements in the first window of size `m` of array `a` that match the elements in `b`.
   - It decrements the count in `cnt_b` for each element in the initial window and checks if the count is non-negative to update `curr`.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

5. **Sliding Window:**
   - It uses a sliding window approach to check all subarrays of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window, it updates `cnt_b` and `curr` accordingly.
   - For each element removed from the window, it also updates `cnt_b` and `curr` accordingly.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

6. **Resetting Counts:**
   - After processing each test case, it resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b` to zero.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of Sliding Window Logic:**
  - The sliding window approach is correctly implemented to efficiently count the number of good subarrays.
  - The initial window check and subsequent sliding window updates are logically sound and handle the constraints appropriately.

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 1 or when `k` is equal to `m`.
  - It correctly resets the counts in `cnt_b` after each test case to ensure no carryover between test cases.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The use of a fixed-size list `cnt_b` allows for efficient counting and updating of element frequencies.
  - The time complexity of the sliding window approach is \(O(n)\) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the required functionality and handles the given constraints and edge cases. The logic for counting and updating the elements in the sliding window is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
