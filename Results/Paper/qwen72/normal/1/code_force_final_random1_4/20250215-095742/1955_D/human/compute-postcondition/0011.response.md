Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` must be greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is 2, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt_b[b[2]]` by 1.
- The value of `i` is 2, so `b[i]` refers to `b[2]`.
- The initial state mentions that `cnt_b[b[0]]` and `cnt_b[b[1]]` are each incremented by 1.
- After executing the code, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is also incremented by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
