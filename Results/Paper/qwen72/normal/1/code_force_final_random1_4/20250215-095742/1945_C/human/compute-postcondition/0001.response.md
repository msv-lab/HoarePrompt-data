The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be initialized to a specific value before the loop starts.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (no specific initialization required)**
