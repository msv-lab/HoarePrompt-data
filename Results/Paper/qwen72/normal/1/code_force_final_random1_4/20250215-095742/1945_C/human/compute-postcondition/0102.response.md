The value `i + 1` is appended to the list `lst`. The values of `i`, `n`, `zero_perc`, `zero`, `one`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `zero_perc` is `zero * 50`, if `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is increased by 1, otherwise, `one` is increased by 1, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `lst` contains `[i + 1]`**.
