The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ele` and the list `lst`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If `lst` contains more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` must contain at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%, and `ele` is the first element in `lst`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must still contain at least one more element after the first one. Therefore, `lst` must contain at least two elements, and `ele` will be the second element in `lst`.

State: **`lst` must contain at least two indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%, `ele` is the second element in `lst`, `mini` is now the minimum of its original value and `abs(pk - ele)`**
