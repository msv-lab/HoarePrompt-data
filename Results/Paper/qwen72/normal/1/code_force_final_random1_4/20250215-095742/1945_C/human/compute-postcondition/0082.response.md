The provided code snippet sets the variables `zero` and `one` to 0. This overrides their previous values, which were the number of '0's and '1's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value among the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (n - 1) - 1)`, `lst` contains the indices (1-based) where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50`, `final` is sorted in ascending order and contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, if `len(final) == 0`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes the value 0, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` includes the value `n`, and `t` is decremented by 1.**
