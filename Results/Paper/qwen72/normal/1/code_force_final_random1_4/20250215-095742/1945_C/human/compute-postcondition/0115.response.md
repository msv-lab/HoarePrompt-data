The code snippet updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. Since `ele` is the first element of `lst`, and `lst` contains at least one element, `ele` is a valid reference.

Let's break down the impact:

- `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.
- `lst` remains unchanged.
- `ele` remains the first element of `lst`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `ele` is the first element of `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.**
