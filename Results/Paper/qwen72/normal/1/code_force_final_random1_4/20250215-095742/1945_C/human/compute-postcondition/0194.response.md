The code snippet `final.append(elem)` adds the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Given that `elem` is the first element in `lst`, and `final` was initially an empty list, after executing this code, `final` will contain `elem` as its only element. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mini` will be the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`, `ele` is the first element in `lst`, `lst` must have at least one element, `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst`, all other variables remain unchanged, and the current value of `abs(pk - elem)` is equal to `mini`.**
