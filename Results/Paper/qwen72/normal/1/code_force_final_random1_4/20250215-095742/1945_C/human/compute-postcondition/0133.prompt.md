Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. The variable `ele` will be the last element of `lst` that was processed in the loop. All other variables (`n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `final`, `c1`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`) remain unchanged, except `final` which is now an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `ele` is the last element of `lst` that was processed in the loop, `lst` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`, all other variables (`n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `c1`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged, and `final` is an empty list. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst` (`elem`). Otherwise, `final` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `ele` is the last element of `lst` that was processed in the loop, `lst` must have at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `lst`, all other variables (`n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `c1`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged, and `final` is a list containing the second element of `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element of `lst` is equal to `mini`; otherwise, `final` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `ele` is the last element of `lst` that was processed in the loop, `lst` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `lst`, all other variables (`n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `c1`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged, and `final` is a list containing the third element of `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element of `lst` is equal to `mini`; otherwise, `final` remains a list containing the second element of `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element of `lst` is equal to `mini`, or an empty list if neither condition is met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
