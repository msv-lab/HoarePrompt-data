Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, if `n` is even, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, if `n` is odd, `pk` is also set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (n - 1) - 1)`, and `lst` contains the indices (1-based) where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.**

In natural language, after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be `n - 2` because the loop runs from `0` to `n - 2`.
- The variable `zero` will contain the count of '0's found in the first `n-1` characters of the string `s`.
- The variable `one` will contain the count of '1's found in the first `n-1` characters of the string `s`.
- The variable `zero_perc` will be the percentage of '0's in the first `n-1` characters.
- The variable `one_perc` will be the percentage of remaining '1's in the substring starting from the `n-1`th character to the end of the string.
- The list `lst` will contain the indices (1-based) where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were greater than or equal to 50 during the loop's execution.
