Output State: **`mini` will be the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`, `ele` is the second element in `lst`, `lst` must have at least two elements, `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst` and `elem`. All other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst` if `abs(pk - elem)` is equal to `mini`.
- The code `final.append(elem)` adds the value of `elem` (which is the second element in `lst`) to the list `final`.
- Therefore, after executing the code, `final` now contains both the first element of `lst` and `elem`.
- All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
