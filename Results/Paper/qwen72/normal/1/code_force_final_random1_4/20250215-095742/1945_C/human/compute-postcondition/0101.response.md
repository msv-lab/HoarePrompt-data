Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `zero_perc` is `zero * 50`, if `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is increased by 1, otherwise, `one` is increased by 1, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer greater than 1.
- The value of `zero_perc` remains `zero * 50`.
- The condition for updating `zero` or `one` based on `s[i]` remains unchanged.
- The new variable `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. The value of `o` is not specified in the initial state, so `one_perc` is expressed in terms of `o`, `one`, `n`, and `i`.
