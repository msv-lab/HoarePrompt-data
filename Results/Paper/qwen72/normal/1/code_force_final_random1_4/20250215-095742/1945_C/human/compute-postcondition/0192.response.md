To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object in the loop head, which is `lst` and the iterator `elem`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `mini` will be the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`.
- `ele` will be the last element processed from `lst`.
- All other variables (`s`, `sl`, `pk`, `final`, `o`, `z`, `n`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `i`, `lst`) remain unchanged, except `final` which is now an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element. The variable `elem` will be the first element in `lst` at the start of the first iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`mini` will be the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`, `ele` is the first element in `lst`, `lst` must have at least one element, `final` is an empty list, all other variables remain unchanged**
