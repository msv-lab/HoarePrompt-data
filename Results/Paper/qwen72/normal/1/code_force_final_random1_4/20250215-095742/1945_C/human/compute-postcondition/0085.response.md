To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be greater than 1. Since `n` is already given as an input integer greater than 1, it meets this requirement. The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to begin correctly.

Given these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` starts at 0, and `n` remains greater than 1. All other variables mentioned in the initial state are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1**
