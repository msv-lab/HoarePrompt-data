Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. The variable `ele` is the last element of `lst` that was processed in the loop. The list `final` contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, and `final` is now sorted in ascending order. However, the current length of `final` is 0. The variable `c1` is now equal to `(o * 100) // n`. All other variables (`n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged.**
