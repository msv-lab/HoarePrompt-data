Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `zero` will be the number of '0's encountered up to the second-to-last element of `s`, `one` will be the number of '1's encountered up to the second-to-last element of `s`, `zero_perc` will be the percentage of '0's encountered so far, `one_perc` will be the percentage of remaining '1's, `lst` will contain indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%, `i` will be `n-2`, and `mini` will remain 100000000. All other variables (`s`, `sl`, `pk`, `ele`, `final`, `o`, `z`, `n`) remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `0` to `n-2` (i.e., `n-1` times).
- `zero` and `one` are incremented based on the value of `s[i]` at each iteration.
- `zero_perc` is calculated as the percentage of '0's encountered so far.
- `one_perc` is calculated as the percentage of '1's that remain to be encountered.
- If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%, the current index `i+1` is appended to `lst`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-2` because the loop runs `n-1` times.
- `mini` remains unchanged at 100000000.
- All other variables (`s`, `sl`, `pk`, `ele`, `final`, `o`, `z`, `n`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
