To determine what will be printed by the `print(final[0])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`.
   - `ele` is the last element of `lst` that was processed in the loop.
   - `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, and this list is sorted in ascending order.
   - If `len(final) == 0`, the length of `final` is set to 1.
   - `c1` is calculated as `(o * 100) // n`.
   - If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, the first element of `final` is set to 0.
   - If `c1` is less than 50, the first element of `final` is set to `n`.

2. **Determine the Value of `final[0]`:**
   - We need to check the value of `c1` to determine the first element of `final`.
   - `c1` is calculated as `(o * 100) // n`.
   - If `c1 >= 50`, then `final[0]` is set to 0.
   - If `c1 < 50`, then `final[0]` is set to `n`.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(final[0])` statement will print the first element of the `final` list, which is determined by the value of `c1`.

Given the conditions:
- If `c1 >= 50`, the output will be 0.
- If `c1 < 50`, the output will be `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **0 if c1 >= 50, otherwise n (where c1 is (o * 100) // n and n is the value of n)**
