Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, if `n` is even, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, if `n` is odd, `pk` is also set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 0, if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, and `zero_perc` is 100. Otherwise, `zero` is 0, `one` is 1, and `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**

Explanation:
- The code calculates the value of `one_perc` using the formula `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.
- The value of `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`.
- The value of `one` is either 0 or 1 depending on the character at index `i` in `s`.
- The value of `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- The value of `i` is 0.
- The value of `one_perc` is calculated based on these values and is updated accordingly.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
