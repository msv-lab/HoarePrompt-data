Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', `zero` is increased by 1, otherwise, `one` is increased by 1, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 1`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer greater than 1.
- The conditions for `zero` and `one` remain unchanged based on the initial state.
- The value of `zero_perc` remains `zero * 100 // 1`.
- The new variable `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 1)`. Note that `o` is not defined in the initial state, so it is assumed to be a variable that exists in the context.
