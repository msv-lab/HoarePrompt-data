To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is `ele` and `lst`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `lst` will contain indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%.
- `ele` will be the elements (indices) from `lst`.

For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element. The value of `ele` will be the first element in `lst` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `lst` is not empty and `ele` is set to the first element of `lst`.

State: **`lst` must contain at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%, `ele` is the first element in `lst`**
