Output State: **`sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`, `mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `ele` is the last element of `lst` that was processed in the loop, `final` is a sorted list in ascending order containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, if `len(final) == 0`, the length of `final` is 1, if `c1` (which is equal to `(o * 100) // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, the first element of `final` is 0, if `c1` is less than 50, the first element of `final` is `n`, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `s` is the string provided by the user input, `pk` is now equal to `n / 2`, all other variables (`s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged.**
