Output State: **`one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `lst` is `[2]` if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both at least 50, otherwise `lst` is `[1]`, `mini` is 100000000, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `ele`, `final` remain unchanged, `zero` is 1 or 0 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0' or '1', `one` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0' or '1', `zero_perc` is 50 if `s[0]` is '0' or 0 if `s[0]` is '1'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `one_perc` is updated to `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.
- All other variables (`lst`, `mini`, `n`, `i`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `ele`, `final`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
