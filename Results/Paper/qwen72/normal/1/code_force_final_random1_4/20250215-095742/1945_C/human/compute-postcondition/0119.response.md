The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ele` and the list `lst`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If `lst` has at least three elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` must contain at least two elements, `ele` is the second element of `lst`. For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must have at least three elements, and `ele` will be the third element of `lst`.

State: **`lst` must contain at least three elements, `ele` is the third element of `lst`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element of `lst`**
