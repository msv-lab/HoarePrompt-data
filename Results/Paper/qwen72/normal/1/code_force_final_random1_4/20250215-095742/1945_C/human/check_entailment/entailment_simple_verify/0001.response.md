### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `s` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The variable `pk` is set to `n / 2` regardless of whether `n` is even or odd. This is used to find the position closest to the middle of the village.
   - The string `s` is converted to a list `sl` for easier manipulation.
   - The variables `o` and `z` count the total number of '1's and '0's in the string `s`.

3. **Iterating Through Houses**:
   - The function iterates through the houses from 0 to `n-2` (i.e., `range(n-1)`).
   - It maintains a running count of '0's (`zero`) and '1's (`one`) encountered so far.
   - For each position `i`, it calculates the percentage of '0's on the left side (`zero_perc`) and the percentage of '1's on the right side (`one_perc`).

4. **Condition Check**:
   - If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%, the position `i+1` is added to the list `lst`.

5. **Finding the Optimal Position**:
   - The function then finds the position in `lst` that is closest to `pk` (the middle of the village).
   - If multiple positions have the same distance to `pk`, the smallest one is chosen.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If no valid positions are found in `lst`, the function checks if the entire village can be declared as one side (either all '1's or all '0's). If more than 50% of the residents are satisfied, it outputs 0; otherwise, it outputs `n`.

### Analysis:
- The logic for counting '0's and '1's and checking the conditions is correct.
- The approach to find the optimal position by minimizing the distance to `pk` is also correct.
- The edge case handling for when no valid positions are found is correctly implemented.

However, there is a minor issue in the initial setup of `pk`. The variable `pk` should be an integer, but it is currently a float. This can be fixed by using integer division:

```python
pk = n // 2
```

This change ensures that `pk` is an integer, which is more appropriate for the subsequent calculations.

### Conclusion:
Despite the minor issue with `pk` being a float, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately. The fix for `pk` is straightforward and does not affect the overall correctness of the program.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
