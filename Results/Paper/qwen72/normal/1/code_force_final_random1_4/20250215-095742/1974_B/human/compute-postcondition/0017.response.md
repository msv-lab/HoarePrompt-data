Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 1. If `char` is in `unique_chars`, all occurrences of `char` in `s` are replaced by `unique_chars[j]`, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 3`, and `char` is the second character in `s` if `s` has at least 2 characters, with `unique_chars` being a sorted list of unique characters from the original `s`. If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `char` is inserted at index 2 of `unique_chars`, `i` is 2, `j` is `len(unique_chars) + 1`, and `char` is the second character in `s` if `s` has at least 2 characters.***
