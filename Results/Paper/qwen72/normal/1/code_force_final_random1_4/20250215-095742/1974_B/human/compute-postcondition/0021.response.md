Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 1, `char` is the third character in `s` if `s` has at least 3 characters, `i` is 0 or 2 depending on whether the previous `char` was in `unique_chars`, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 3` if the previous `char` was in `unique_chars` or `len(unique_chars) + 1` if the previous `char` was not in `unique_chars`, and `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the original `s` with `char` inserted at index `i`.**

Explanation:
- The code `unique_chars.insert(i, char)` inserts the character `char` into the list `unique_chars` at the position specified by `i`.
- The value of `i` is either 0 or 2, depending on whether the previous `char` was in `unique_chars`.
- The list `unique_chars` now includes `char` at the specified index, and the rest of the list remains sorted.
- The values of `s`, `char`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, except for the modification to `unique_chars`.
