Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 1. If `char` (the third character in `s` if `s` has at least 3 characters) is in `unique_chars`, `s` is updated by replacing all occurrences of `char` with `unique_chars[j]`, where `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 4` if the previous `char` was in `unique_chars` or `len(unique_chars)` if the previous `char` was not in `unique_chars`. `i` is 0 or 2 depending on whether the previous `char` was in `unique_chars`, and `j` is updated accordingly. If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `s` remains unchanged, `char` is the third character in `s` if `s` has at least 3 characters, `i` is 1 or 3 depending on whether the previous `char` was in `unique_chars`, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2` if the previous `char` was in `unique_chars` or `len(unique_chars) + 2` if the previous `char` was not in `unique_chars`, and `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the original `s` with `char` inserted at index `i`.***
