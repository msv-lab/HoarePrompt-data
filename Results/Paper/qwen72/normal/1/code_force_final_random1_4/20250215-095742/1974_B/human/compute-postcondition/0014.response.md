Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 1, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s` with `char` inserted at index `i`, `i` is 1, and `j` is `len(unique_chars)`. If `char` was already in `unique_chars`, it is now duplicated in the list. If `char` was not in `unique_chars`, it is now the first element in the list. `char` is the second character in `s` if `s` has at least 2 characters.**
