You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Encoding Process**: The encoding process involves creating a sorted list of unique characters from the input string `s` and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list. For example, if `s = "codeforces"`, the sorted unique characters are `"cdefors"`. The first character `'c'` is replaced by `'s'`, the second character `'o'` is replaced by `'e'`, and so on.

2. **Decoding Process**: To decode, we need to reverse the encoding process. We should create the same sorted list of unique characters and then replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` to decode the string `b`.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Step 1**: It creates a sorted list of unique characters from the input string `s`.
   - **Step 2**: It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the unique characters list, respectively.
   - **Step 3**: It iterates over each character in the input string `s`:
     - If the character is in the unique characters list, it replaces the character in `s` with the corresponding symmetric character from the list and decrements `j`.
     - If the character is not in the unique characters list, it inserts the character into the unique characters list and increments both `i` and `j`.
   - **Step 4**: It returns the modified unique characters list as a string.

5. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The logic inside the loop is incorrect. The program attempts to replace characters in the input string `s` while iterating over it, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
   - The program also modifies the `unique_chars` list during iteration, which is not necessary and can cause issues.
   - The final return statement should return the decoded string, not the modified `unique_chars` list.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - Create a mapping from each character in the unique characters list to its symmetric counterpart.
   - Use this mapping to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from the mapping.

Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect.
