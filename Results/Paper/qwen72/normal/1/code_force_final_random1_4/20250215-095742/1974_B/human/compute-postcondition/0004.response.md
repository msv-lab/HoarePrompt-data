The code snippet `s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` replaces all occurrences of the character `char` in the string `s` with the last character in the `unique_chars` list (which is `unique_chars[j]`).

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 1.
- `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s`.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`.
- `char` is in `unique_chars`.

After executing the code:
- The string `s` is updated such that all occurrences of `char` are replaced with `unique_chars[j]`.
- The values of `i`, `j`, and `unique_chars` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the original string with all occurrences of `char` replaced by `unique_chars[j]`, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the original string `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`, and `char` is in `unique_chars`.**
