Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 1, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s`. If `char` is in `unique_chars`, all occurrences of `char` in `s` are replaced by `unique_chars[j-1]`, `i` is 0, and `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2`. If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `char` is inserted at index 0 of `unique_chars`, `i` is 1, and `j` is `len(unique_chars)`.***
