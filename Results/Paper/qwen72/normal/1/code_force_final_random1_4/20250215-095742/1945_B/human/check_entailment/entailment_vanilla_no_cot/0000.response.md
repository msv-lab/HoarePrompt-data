Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all edge cases and logic for calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. Specifically, the logic for calculating the visibility overlap is flawed. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Visibility Overlap**: The formula `mn = min(a, b) + m` is used to calculate the visibility period, but this does not accurately represent the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The correct approach involves calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine when both installations launch fireworks at the same time.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)` is not necessary and does not correctly handle the scenario where `a` or `b` is 1. When either `a` or `b` is 1, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time should be `m + 1`.

3. **Correct Logic**: The correct approach involves calculating the LCM of `a` and `b` and then determining the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation plus one additional firework if both installations launch at the same time.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = lcm(a, b)
        max_fireworks = (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b - (m + 1) // l
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This corrected version uses the LCM to ensure that the overlap in launch times is correctly accounted for, and it handles the edge cases where `a` or `b` is 1.
