Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers, `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either `m` is not divisible by `a`, or `m` is not divisible by `b`, or `a` is 1, or `b` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` are now assigned the values from the input.
- The initial conditions for `t` being greater than 1 and `i` being 1 remain unchanged.
- The condition regarding `mn` (which is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`) and the divisibility checks for `m` by `a` and `b` remain as they were initially described.
