The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it is implied that the function should accept four parameters: `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. Here, `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers within specified ranges.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18.

The function likely processes each test case defined by `a`, `b`, and `m` and returns a result for each test case. Since the specific output is not detailed, we can infer that the function might perform some operation involving `a`, `b`, and `m` and return a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each test case.**
