### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have two installations launching fireworks.
   - The first installation launches fireworks every `a` minutes.
   - The second installation launches fireworks every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any point in time.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - A firework launched at time `x` will be visible from `x` to `x + m`.
   - To maximize the number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the overlap of visibility periods.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program calculates the minimum of `a` and `b` and adds `m` to it (`mn = min(a, b) + m`).
   - It then checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1.
   - If the condition is met, it prints `mn // a + mn // b + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic of adding `m` to the minimum of `a` and `b` is intended to capture the maximum overlap period.
   - However, the condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)` is not necessary for the general solution.
   - The correct approach should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the overlap period.
   - The formula `mn // a + mn // b + 1` is not always correct, especially when `a` and `b` are not coprime.

5. **Correct Solution:**
   - The correct approach involves calculating the LCM of `a` and `b` and using it to determine the maximum number of overlapping fireworks.
   - The correct formula should be `1 + (m // a) + (m // b) - (m // lcm(a, b))`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when `a` and `b` are not coprime. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
