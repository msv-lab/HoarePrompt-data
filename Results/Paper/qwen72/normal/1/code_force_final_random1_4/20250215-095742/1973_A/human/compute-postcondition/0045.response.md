Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have completed, `t` remains a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. The length of `cas_de_test` is equal to `t`. `resultats` is a list containing the results of the loop for each tuple in `cas_de_test`. For each tuple (p_1, p_2, p_3) in `cas_de_test`, if the total points (p_1 + p_2 + p_3) is odd, or if the total matches (total points divided by 2) is greater than 3, or if the highest score (p_3) is greater than the total matches, or if the calculated number of ties (total points - 2 * (p_3 - p_2) - 2 * (p_3 - p_1)) is less than 0, then the corresponding entry in `resultats` is -1. Otherwise, the corresponding entry in `resultats` is the number of ties divided by 2.**
