The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop explicitly mentioned in the provided context, the `continue` statement would typically be used within a loop structure. Without a loop, the `continue` statement does not affect the state of the variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, `p1` is the first element of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing the value `-1`.**
