The provided Python code snippet updates the value of `total_points` by summing up the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. These values are derived from the second tuple in the list `cas_de_test`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
- `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples.
- `p1` is the first element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `p2` is the second element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `p3` is the third element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `total_points` is initially equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`.
- `total_matchs` is initially equal to `total_points // 2`.
- `egalites` is initially equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
- If `egalites` is less than 0 or if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing the value `-1`. Otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing the value `egalites // 2`.

The code snippet:
```python
total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
```

Impact of the code:
- The value of `total_points` is updated to be the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Since `total_points` was already defined as `p1 + p2 + p3` in the initial state, the value of `total_points` remains the same.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples, `p1` is the first element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` is less than 0 or if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing the value `-1`. Otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing the value `egalites // 2`.**
