Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, `p1` is the first element of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` is less than 0 or if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing the value `-1`. Otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing the value `egalites // 2`.***
