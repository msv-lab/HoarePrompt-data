Reasoning:

1. **Total Points Check**: The function correctly checks if the total points are even. This is essential because in a series of games where each game awards either 2 points (for a win/loss) or 2 points (for a draw), the total points must be even. If the total points are odd, it's impossible to achieve the given scores, and the function correctly appends `-1`.

2. **Total Matches Check**: The function calculates the total number of matches as `total_points // 2`. This is correct because each match (whether it ends in a win/loss or a draw) contributes 2 points to the total. The function then checks if the total number of matches exceeds 3. This check is necessary because the maximum number of matches that can be played among three players is 3 (each pair playing once).

3. **Highest Score Check**: The function checks if the highest score (`p3`) is greater than the total number of matches. This is a valid check because the highest score should not exceed the total number of matches, as each match can only contribute up to 2 points to any single player.

4. **Calculating Draws**: The function calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula aims to account for the points that could have been distributed through wins and losses, and the remaining points are attributed to draws. However, this formula might need a closer look to ensure it correctly handles all edge cases.

5. **Final Calculation**: The function divides the calculated number of draws by 2 to get the final number of draws. This step is correct because each draw contributes 2 points to the total.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic for calculating the number of draws. The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` might not always correctly account for the distribution of points. Specifically, the formula assumes that the difference in points between the highest and the other players is solely due to wins/losses, which might not always be the case.

To verify the correctness, let's consider the provided test cases:

- **Test Case (0, 0, 0)**: No games were played, so no draws. Correct output: `0`.
- **Test Case (0, 1, 1)**: One draw between the second and third players. Correct output: `1`.
- **Test Case (0, 2, 3)**: This case is not possible because the total points (5) are odd. Correct output: `-1`.
- **Test Case (3, 3, 3)**: This case is not possible because the total points (9) are odd. Correct output: `-1`.
- **Test Case (3, 4, 5)**: Six draws. Correct output: `6`.
- **Test Case (1, 1, 10)**: Two draws. Correct output: `2`.
- **Test Case (0, 0, 6)**: Three draws. Correct output: `3`.

Given the above reasoning and verification, the function appears to handle most cases correctly, but the formula for calculating draws might need further refinement.

Correctness: **False** (due to potential issues in the formula for calculating draws).
