The given code snippet updates the value of `total_matchs` to be the integer division of `total_points` by 2. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- `total_matchs` is updated to `total_points // 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, `egalites`, and `resultats`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
- `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples.
- `p1` is the first element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `p2` is the second element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `p3` is the third element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`.
- `total_matchs` is initially equal to `total_points // 2`.
- `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
- If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` now contains the value `-1` appended to its existing values.
- Otherwise, if `egalites` is less than 0 or if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing the value `-1`.
- Otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing the value `egalites // 2`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `total_matchs` is updated to `total_points // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples, `p1` is the first element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, if `total_points` is odd, `resultats` now contains the value `-1` appended to its existing values, otherwise, if `egalites` is less than 0 or if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing the value `-1`, otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing the value `egalites // 2`.**
