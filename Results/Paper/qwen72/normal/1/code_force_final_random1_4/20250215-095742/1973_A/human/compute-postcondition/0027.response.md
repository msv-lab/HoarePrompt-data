The code snippet updates the value of `egalites` based on the formula `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `egalites` is recalculated using the given formula.
- The values of `t`, `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, and `total_matchs` remain unchanged.
- The state of `resultats` remains unchanged as the code snippet does not modify it.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples.
- `p1` is the first element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `p2` is the second element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `p3` is the third element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`.
- `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`.
- `egalites` is initially equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
- If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing the value `-1` appended to its existing values. Otherwise, the state of `resultats` remains unchanged.

After executing the code snippet:
- `egalites` is updated to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples, `p1` is the first element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing the value `-1` appended to its existing values. Otherwise, the state of `resultats` remains unchanged.**
