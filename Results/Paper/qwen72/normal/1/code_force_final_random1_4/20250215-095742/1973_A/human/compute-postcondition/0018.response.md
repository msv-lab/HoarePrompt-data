To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
```

This loop iterates over the list `cas_de_test`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers `(p1, p2, p3)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - The list `cas_de_test` is also part of the loop head, as it determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` were the first elements of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in `cas_de_test` must be used to update `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

3. **Update the State:**
   - After the previous iteration, the next tuple in `cas_de_test` will be used.
   - Therefore, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be updated to the values of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more tuples in `cas_de_test`.

### Updated State:

Given that `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, for the loop to execute one more time, `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples. The next tuple in `cas_de_test` will provide the new values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples, `p1` is the first element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` is less than 0 or if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing the value `-1`. Otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing the value `egalites // 2`.**
