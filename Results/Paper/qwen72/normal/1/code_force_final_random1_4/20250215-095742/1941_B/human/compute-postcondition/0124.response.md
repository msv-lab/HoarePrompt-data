Output State: **After all iterations, `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `numTest` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers from the final input, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n-3]`, `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`. If `stop` is True, at least one `a[i]` (where 0 <= i < n-2) is less than 0, and the program skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. If `a[len(a) - 1]` is not 0 or `a[len(a) - 2]` is not 0, the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, if `a[len(a) - 1]` is 0 and `a[len(a) - 2]` is 0, the program prints 'YES'.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the specified range, as it represents the total number of test cases.
- **`numTest`**: Is decremented to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- **`_`**: Is incremented to `t - 1`, reflecting the completion of the last test case.
- **`n`**: For each test case, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3.
- **`a`**: The array `a` is updated based on the operations performed in the loop. Specifically, `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are set to 0, `a[n-2]` is adjusted by subtracting `2 * a[n-3]`, and `a[n-1]` is adjusted by subtracting `a[n-3]`.
- **`i`**: Is set to `n - 3`, which is the last index in the inner loop.
- **`opNum`**: Is the value of `a[n-3]` before the adjustments.
- **`stop`**: If any element `a[i]` (where 0 <= i < n-2) becomes less than 0, `stop` is set to True, and the loop skips the remaining operations for that test case.
- **Final Check**: After the inner loop, if the last two elements of `a` (`a[len(a) - 1]` and `a[len(a) - 2]`) are both 0, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
