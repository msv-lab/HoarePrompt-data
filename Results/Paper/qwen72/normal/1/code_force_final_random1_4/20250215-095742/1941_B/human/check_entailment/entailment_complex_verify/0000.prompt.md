You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9, representing the elements of the array. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and for each test case, the variable `a` has been assigned the value of `n` (the number of elements in the list `b`). For each list `b` of integers read from the input, if the first element of `b` is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2, then "NO" is printed. Otherwise, "YES" is printed. The loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case independently.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the first element of the list is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element of the list is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2. If either condition is true, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES". The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, with each list containing between 3 and 200,000 integers, and the sum of the lengths of all lists does not exceed 200,000.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, the logic in the program only checks the first two elements and the last two elements of the array to determine if the operation can be applied to make all elements zero. This approach is insufficient because it does not consider the entire array and the cumulative effect of the operations.

A counterexample where the program fails is:
- Input: `5\n1 2 3 4 5`
- Expected Output: `NO`
- Actual Output: `YES`

In this case, the program incorrectly outputs `YES` because it only checks the first two and last two elements, which do not violate the conditions checked in the program. However, it is impossible to make all elements zero using the given operations for this input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
