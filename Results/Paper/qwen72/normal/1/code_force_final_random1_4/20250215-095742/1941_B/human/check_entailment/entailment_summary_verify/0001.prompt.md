You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the first element of the list is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element of the list is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2. If either condition is true, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES". The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, with each list containing between 3 and 200,000 integers, and the sum of the lengths of all lists does not exceed 200,000.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation.
   - The operation involves choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The operation affects three consecutive elements.
   - The total sum of the array decreases by 4 with each operation.
   - The parity (odd/even nature) of the elements at the boundaries (first and last elements) plays a crucial role in determining the feasibility of making all elements zero.

3. **Conditions for Feasibility:**
   - If the first element \( a_0 \) is odd, the second element \( a_1 \) must be \( a_0 + 2 \) to allow the operation to reduce both to zero.
   - Similarly, if the last element \( a_{n-1} \) is odd, the second-to-last element \( a_{n-2} \) must be \( a_{n-1} + 2 \).

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It checks if the first element is odd and the second element is not \( a_0 + 2 \), or if the last element is odd and the second-to-last element is not \( a_{n-1} + 2 \).
   - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program only checks the boundary conditions but does not consider the entire array.
   - The logic assumes that if the boundary conditions are met, the rest of the array can be made zero, which is not always true.
   - For example, if the array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2], the program will correctly output 'YES', but if the array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 3], the program will incorrectly output 'YES' because it does not check the internal consistency.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it only checks the boundary conditions and does not ensure that the entire array can be reduced to zero. Therefore, the program may produce incorrect results for some test cases.
