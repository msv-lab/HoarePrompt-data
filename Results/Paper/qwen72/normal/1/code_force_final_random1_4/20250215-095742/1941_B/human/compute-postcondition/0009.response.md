The code snippet `a = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. This operation does not affect the other variables or conditions specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is a list of integers read from the input. If the first element of `b` is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2, then the condition specified in the if part is true. Otherwise, either `b[0] % 2 == 0` or `b[1] == b[0] + 2`, and either `b[-1] % 2 == 0` or `b[-2] == b[-1] + 2`.**
