Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the number of elements in the array. The array a consists of n integers where 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `numTest` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(0, numTest):
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    stop = False
    for i in range(0, n - 2):
        if a[i] < 0:
            print('NO')
            stop = True
            break
        opNum = a[i]
        a[i] -= opNum
        a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
        a[i + 2] -= opNum
    if stop == True:
        continue
    if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `numTest` is equal to `t`, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n-3]`, `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`. If `stop` is True, at least one `a[i]` (where 0 <= i < n-2) is less than 0, and the program skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. If `a[len(a) - 1]` is not 0 or `a[len(a) - 2]` is not 0, the program continues with the next statements in the loop. Otherwise, if `a[len(a) - 1]` is 0 and `a[len(a) - 2]` is 0, the program also continues with the next statements in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `numTest` is equal to `t`, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n-3]`, `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - sum of opNums from 0 to i`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - sum of 2 * opNums from 0 to i + 1`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - sum of opNums from 0 to i + 2`. If `stop` is True, there exists at least one `a[i]` (where 0 <= i < n-2) that is less than 0. Additionally, if `a[len(a) - 1]` is not 0 or `a[len(a) - 2]` is not 0, the condition from the if part applies. Otherwise, if `a[len(a) - 1]` is 0 and `a[len(a) - 2]` is 0, the condition from the else part applies.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `numTest` is `t - 1`, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is now a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n-3]`, `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - sum of opNums from 0 to i`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - (sum of 2 * opNums from 0 to i + 1) - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - sum of opNums from 0 to i + 2 - a[n-3]`. If `a[len(a) - 1]` is not 0 or `a[len(a) - 2]` is not 0, the last element of `a` (`a[len(a) - 1]`) is not 0 or the second-to-last element of `a` (`a[len(a) - 2]`) is not 0. If `stop` is `True`, the loop continues to the next iteration because at least one `a[i]` is less than 0 during the loop execution. Otherwise, the loop does not continue to the next iteration. If `a[len(a) - 1]` is 0 and `a[len(a) - 2]` is 0, the last two elements of `a` are 0. If `stop` is `True`, the loop continues to the next iteration because at least one `a[i]` is less than 0 during the loop execution. Otherwise, the loop does not continue to the next iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
