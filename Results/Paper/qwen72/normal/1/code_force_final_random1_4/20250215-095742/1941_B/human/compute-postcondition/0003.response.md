Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers read from the input. Either the first element of `b` is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2.**
