Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `numTest` is `t - 1`.
3. `_` is 2.
4. `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3.
5. `a` is a list of integers from the new input.
6. `i` is 0.
7. `opNum` is `a[n-3]`.
8. `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are 0.
9. `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`.
10. `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`.
11. `a[i]` is `a[i] - sum of opNums from 0 to i`.
12. `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - sum of 2 * opNums from 0 to i + 1`.
13. `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - sum of opNums from 0 to i + 2`.
14. `stop` is False.
15. The current value of `a[i]` is less than 0.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
- The print statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.
- The conditions provided do not affect the content of the print statement directly. They only set up the context in which the print statement is executed.
- Since the current value of `a[i]` is less than 0, it triggers the print statement to execute.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
