t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9, representing the elements of the array. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
