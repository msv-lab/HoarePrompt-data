Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 0.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- The condition is that either `(b - a + 1) <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

### Explanation:

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`. The conditions described in the initial state do not affect the output of the `print` statement directly. The conditions are used to determine whether the `print` statement should execute, but since the `print` statement is present and not conditional, it will always print `'NO'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
