Output State: **`m` is 0, `_` is `m-1`, `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.**

### Explanation:
- **`m` is 0**: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `m` (which represents the number of iterations left) is 0.
- **`_` is `m-1`**: The loop variable `_` will have incremented to `m-1` because the loop runs `m` times, starting from 0.
- **`a` and `b` are integers provided by user input**: These values are determined by the user input during each iteration of the loop.
- **`i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`**: This is the difference in the cumulative count of 1s between indices `b` and `a-1` in the list `l`.
- **`s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**: This is the difference in the cumulative sum of elements between indices `b` and `a-1` in the list `l`.
- **Condition Check**: The condition inside the loop checks if the length of the subarray (`b - a + 1`) is greater than 1 and if the difference in the cumulative sum minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the difference in the cumulative count of 1s. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
