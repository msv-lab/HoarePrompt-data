Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It processes each test case by reading the array and the queries, then it uses prefix sums (`p`) and a count of ones (`c`) to efficiently answer each query. The logic checks if the subarray can be transformed into a "good" array by ensuring that the total sum minus the length of the subarray is at least equal to the number of ones in the subarray, which is a necessary condition for the subarray to be "good". This approach is efficient and handles the constraints provided in the problem statement.
