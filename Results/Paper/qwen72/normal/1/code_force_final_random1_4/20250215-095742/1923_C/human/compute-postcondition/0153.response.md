Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is decremented by the number of test cases processed, `n` and `q` remain as initially defined, `l` is the list of integers from user input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`, `c` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of `1`s in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`, `i` and `j` are the final counts of the cumulative sums and `1`s respectively, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers from user input, `s` is the difference `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, and `m` is 0. For each query, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
