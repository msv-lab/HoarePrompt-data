The code snippet `c.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Given that `c` initially contains a single element 0, and `j` is 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 0, the value of `j` will be appended to `c`.

- If `x` is 1, then `j` is 1, and `c` will become `[0, 1]`.
- If `x` is not 1, then `j` is 0, and `c` will become `[0, 0]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing elements [0, `i`], `c` is a list containing elements [0, `j`], `i` is 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `i` is 0, `j` is 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 0, and `x` remains 1 if `x` is 1.**
