Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `p[b] - p[a - 1]` to the variable `s`. The values of `m`, `_`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new state includes the updated value of `s` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.
