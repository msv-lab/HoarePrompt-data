The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `_` is 0 and `m` must be greater than 0. These variables are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are input integers.**
