The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust these. The loop will execute again if `_` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `m` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`m` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, and `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.**
