Output State: **`_` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, and `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `_` and `m` remain unchanged.
- The variables `a` and `b` are now assigned the values from the user input, which are split and converted to integers.
- The expressions for `i` and `s` remain the same, using the updated values of `a` and `b`.
- The conditions involving `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s` are still valid and depend on the new values of `a` and `b`.
