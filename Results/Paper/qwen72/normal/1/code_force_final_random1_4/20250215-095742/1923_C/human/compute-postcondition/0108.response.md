Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `_` is `m` (which was initially 0), `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`. `l` is a list of integers from user input. `p` is now a list containing a single element `[0]`. `c` is now a list containing a single element `[0]`. `i` is 0, `j` is 0.**
