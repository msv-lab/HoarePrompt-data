Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; queries is a list of q pairs (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [0]
    c = [0]
    i, j = 0, 0
    for x in l:
        if x == 1:
            j += 1
        i += x
        p.append(i)
        c.append(j)
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
        s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
        if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is `m-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, and `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` is 0, `_` is `m-1`, `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `l` remains a list of integers from user input, `i` is the difference between the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `b` and the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `a-1` in `l`, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`, `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`, `c` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of `1`s in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`, `n` and `m` are as initially defined, `_` is equal to `m-1`, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. For each iteration, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met and 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
