The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. This changes the values of `n` and `m` from their initial states.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is `m`
- `m` is greater than or equal to its initial value
- `a` and `b` are input integers
- `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`
- `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`
- If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`
- The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` is now the first integer input
- `m` is now the second integer input

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is `m`, `m` is the second integer input, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`. The values of `t`, `n` is the first integer input, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.**
