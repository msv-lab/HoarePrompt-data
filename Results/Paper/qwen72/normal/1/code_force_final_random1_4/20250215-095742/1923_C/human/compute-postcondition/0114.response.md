The code `p.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `p`. Given that `i` is equal to `x`, which is the first element of the list `l`, the value of `i` is appended to `p`. The values of `l`, `x`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged except for the modification to `p`.

Output State: **`l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `l`, `i` is equal to `x`, if `x` is 1, `j` is 1; otherwise, `j` remains 0, `p` now contains the value of `x` as its first element.**
