The value of `i` is incremented by the value of `x`, which is the third element in the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `x` is the third element in the list `l`, the value of `i` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list `l`, `i` is increased by the value of `x`, if `x` == 1, `p` is a list containing elements [0, 2, 2] and `c` is a list containing elements [0, 3, 3]. Otherwise, `p` is a list containing elements [0, 0, 0] and `c` is a list containing elements [0, 1, 1].**
