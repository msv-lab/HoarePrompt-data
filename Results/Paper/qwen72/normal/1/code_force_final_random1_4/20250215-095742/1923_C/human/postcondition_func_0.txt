The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of integers and a set of queries. For each test case, it reads the length of the list and the number of queries, then the list itself. It computes two cumulative lists: one for the sum of elements (`p`) and another for the count of ones (`c`). For each query, it checks a condition based on these cumulative lists and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries.
