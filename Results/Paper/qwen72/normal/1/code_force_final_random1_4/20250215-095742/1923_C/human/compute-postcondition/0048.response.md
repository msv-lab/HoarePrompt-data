To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `_` is 2.
2. `m` is greater than 2.
3. `a` and `b` are input integers.
4. `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
5. `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
6. The condition to check is:
   - If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the condition is met.
   - Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.

Given the `print('YES')` statement, it will only execute if the condition is met. Therefore, we need to determine if the condition is met based on the provided information.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1**: `b - a + 1 > 1`
   - This simplifies to `b - a > 0` or `b > a`.

2. **Condition 2**: `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`
   - This simplifies to `p[b] - p[a - 1] - (b - a + 1) >= c[b] - c[a - 1]`.

### Combining Conditions:
- For the `print('YES')` statement to execute, both conditions must be true:
  - `b > a`
  - `p[b] - p[a - 1] - (b - a + 1) >= c[b] - c[a - 1]`

If these conditions are met, the output will be 'YES'. If they are not met, the output will not be 'YES', but since the code snippet only contains the `print('YES')` statement, it implies that the conditions are met.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES** (where the conditions `b > a` and `p[b] - p[a - 1] - (b - a + 1) >= c[b] - c[a - 1]` are met)
