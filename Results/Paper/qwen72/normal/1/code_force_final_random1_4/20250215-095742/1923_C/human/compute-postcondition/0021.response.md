The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` was initially 2 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 1. After incrementing, `j` will be 3 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` will be 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `p` is a list containing elements [0, `i`, `i`], `c` is a list containing elements [0, `j`, `j`], `i` is 2 if `x` is 1, otherwise `i` is 0, `j` is 3 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 2, `x` is the third element in the list `l`.**
