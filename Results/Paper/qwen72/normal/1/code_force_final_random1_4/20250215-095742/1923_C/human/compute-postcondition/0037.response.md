The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `_` being less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `m` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`_` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.**
