You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is decremented by the number of test cases processed, `n` and `q` remain as initially defined, `l` is the list of integers from user input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`, `c` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of `1`s in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`, `i` and `j` are the final counts of the cumulative sums and `1`s respectively, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers from user input, `s` is the difference `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, and `m` is 0. For each query, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if a subarray `c[l..r]` is "good" based on the given conditions.
   - A subarray is "good" if there exists another array `b` such that:
     1. The sum of elements in `c[l..r]` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
     2. No element in `c[l..r]` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
     3. All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For a subarray to be "good," it must have at least one element that can be changed to a different positive value while maintaining the same sum.
   - If the subarray has only one element, it cannot be "good" because there is no other element to change it to without violating the conditions.
   - If the subarray has more than one element, we need to check if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements is at least the number of elements with value 1. This ensures that we can change each element to a different positive value.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `m`.
   - It reads the array `l` and initializes two prefix sum arrays `p` and `c`:
     - `p` stores the prefix sums of the array `l`.
     - `c` stores the prefix counts of the number of 1s in the array `l`.
   - For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray `c[l..r]` and the count of 1s in the subarray.
   - It checks if the subarray is "good" by verifying the condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, where `s` is the sum of the subarray, `b - a + 1` is the length of the subarray, and `i` is the count of 1s in the subarray.
   - If the condition is met and the subarray has more than one element, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the subarray has only one element.
   - The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements is at least the number of 1s, which is necessary for the subarray to be "good".
   - The program efficiently uses prefix sums and prefix counts to handle multiple queries in linear time.

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.
