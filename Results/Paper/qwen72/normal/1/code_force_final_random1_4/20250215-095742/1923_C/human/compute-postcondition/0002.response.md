The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on whitespace, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `l`.

- The variable `t` remains unchanged.
- The variables `n` and `m` are not affected by this code.
- The new variable `l` is created and holds a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
