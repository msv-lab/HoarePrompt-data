Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.***
