Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `s` is a list of integers from the input with at least 2 elements, the first element of `s` (s[0]) is now the original `s[k-1]`, the `k-1`th element of `s` (s[k-1]) is now the original `s[p]`, the `p`th element of `s` (s[p]) is now the original `s[k-1]`, `h` is the original `s[k-1]`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that was compared with `h` before breaking out of the loop, `i` is the last element in `s` that was compared with `h` before breaking out of the loop, `p` is equal to `j`, `ans1` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and either `s[0]` is not equal to `h` or the element is greater than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, `z` is 1 if any element in `s` is equal to `h` and `s[0]` is not equal to `h` or if any element is greater than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1.**
