Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of unique Cowdeforces ratings (`s`) and an index (`k`). For each test case, it calculates two values: `ans` and `ans1`. `ans` represents the maximum number of elements in `s` (starting from the second element) that are less than or equal to the rating of the cow at index `k-1` before encountering a higher rating. `ans1` represents the maximum number of elements in `s` that are equal to the rating of the cow at index `k-1` after the first occurrence of this rating or after any higher rating. The function prints the maximum of `ans` and `ans1` for each test case. The function does not return any values but outputs the results directly. **
