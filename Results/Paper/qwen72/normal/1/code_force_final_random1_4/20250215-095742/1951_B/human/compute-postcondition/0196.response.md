Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates on predefined inputs within its scope, including the number of test cases `t`, the number of cows `n`, the index of your cow `k`, and a list of integers `a` representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. For each test case, it returns the rating of the cow at the specified index `k`.**
