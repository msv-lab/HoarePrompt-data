Postcondition: ***If the loop is iterating in forward order, `i` is the second-to-last element of `s` (i.e., `s[n-2]`). The list `s` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue. If `i` == `h`, and `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1, and `z` is 1. If `i` > `h`, the loop breaks. If `i` ≤ `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is incremented by 1. If `i` ≤ `h` and `z` is not 1, `i` remains the second-to-last element of `s` (i.e., `s[n-2]`).***
