Postcondition: ***`i` is the second-to-last element of `s` (i.e., `s[n-2]`), and the list `s` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue. If `i` > `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` ≤ `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` ≤ `h` and `z` is not 1, `i` remains the second-to-last element of `s` (i.e., `s[n-2]`).***
