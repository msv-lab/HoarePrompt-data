Postcondition: ***`s` must contain at least one element, `i` is the last element of `s` (i.e., `s[n-1]`), and `i` is not equal to `h`. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is equal to 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.***
