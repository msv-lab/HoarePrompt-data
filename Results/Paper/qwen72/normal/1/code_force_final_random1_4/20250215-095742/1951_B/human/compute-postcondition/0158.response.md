The code snippet swaps the values of `s[p]` and `s[k - 1]`. Given the initial state:

- `s[p]` is now the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap.
- `s[k - 1]` is now the value of `s[0]` before the swap.
- `s[0]` is now the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap.

After the swap, the new values will be:

- `s[p]` will be the value of `s[0]` before the swap.
- `s[k - 1]` will be the value of `s[p]` before the swap, which is the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap.

Therefore, the values of `s[p]` and `s[k - 1]` are swapped back to their original values before the initial swap. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s[p]` is now the value of `s[0]` before the swap, `s[k - 1]` is now the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `s[0]` is now the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `i` is the last element of `s` (i.e., `s[n-1]`), `h` is the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `j` is `n-2`, `p` is `n-2`, `ans1` is 0, and all other variables (`s`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `z`) remain unchanged.**
