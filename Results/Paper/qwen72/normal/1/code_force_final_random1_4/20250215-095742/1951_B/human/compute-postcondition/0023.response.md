Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `x` is equal to `a[k]`, `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, `c` is 2, `i` is the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `n` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the list `a` and checks if each element `a[i]` is greater than `x`.
- If `a[i]` is greater than `x`, the index `i` is added to the list `ind`, and the counter `c` is incremented.
- The loop breaks when `c` reaches 2, meaning it has found the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`.
- After the loop finishes, `ind` contains the indices of these two elements, `c` is 2, and `i` is the index of the second element that is greater than `x`.
- The list `a` and the value of `x` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
