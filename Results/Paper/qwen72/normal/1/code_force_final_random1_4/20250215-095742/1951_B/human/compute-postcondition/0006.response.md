Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `x` is equal to `a[k]`, `ind` is a list containing `[i]`, `c` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is greater than `x`.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
