Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to its current value.
- The current value of `ans` is `n`.
- The value of `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`.
- The value of `count` is 2.
- Therefore, `ans` becomes `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `m`, `countmins`, `g`) remain unchanged.
