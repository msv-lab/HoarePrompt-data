Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by user input, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / count) - countmins) / count) + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `int(n / count)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
