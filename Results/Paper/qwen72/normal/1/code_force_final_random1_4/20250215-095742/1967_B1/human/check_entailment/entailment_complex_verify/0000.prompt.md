You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by user input for each iteration, `t` remains the same, `i` is `t - 1`, `count` is `m + 1` for the last iteration, `ans` is the final value after all iterations, which is calculated as `n + sum(int((int(n / k) - (k - 1)) / k) + 1 for k in range(2, m + 1))` for each pair of `n` and `m`, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop executed, `countmins` is `m - 1` for the last iteration, `g` is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)` for the last iteration. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks before reaching `count = m + 1` for the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It then calculates a value `ans` starting from `n` and incrementally adds a computed value based on a loop that runs from 2 to `m`. The loop updates `ans` by adding the result of a division operation involving `n` and the current loop index. After processing all test cases, the function prints the final value of `ans` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in its approach to solving the problem. Specifically, the way it calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) does not align with the problem's requirements. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This implies that initially, the program assumes all values of `a` from 1 to `n` paired with `b = 1` are valid. However, this is not necessarily true for all values of `a` and `b`.

2. **Loop and Count Calculation**:
   - The loop iterates over `count` from 2 to `m`.
   - Inside the loop, `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
   - `g` is calculated as `int(n / count)`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins` and then the number of valid pairs is incremented by `int(g / count) + 1`.

3. **Logical Flaw**:
   - The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not correctly checked in the loop.
   - The adjustment of `g` and the calculation of valid pairs inside the loop do not accurately reflect the required condition.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
3 5
```
According to the problem, the valid pairs (a, b) should satisfy:
- \(1 \le a \le 3\)
- \(1 \le b \le 5\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The valid pairs are:
- (1, 1)
- (2, 1)
- (2, 2)
- (3, 1)

However, the program will output a different result because it does not correctly handle the condition for all pairs.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find all valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
