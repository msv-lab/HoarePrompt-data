### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For \(b = 1\), the condition \(a + 1\) being a multiple of \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\) is always true. Therefore, all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid.
   - For \(b > 1\), the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is more restrictive. Specifically, \(a\) must be such that \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `count` to 2 and starts a loop from 2 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\) (starting from 2), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values.
   - It uses the formula `g = int(n / count)` to find the maximum possible value of \(a\) that can satisfy the condition.
   - It then checks if `g` is less than `count - 1`. If so, it breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates the answer by adding the number of valid \(a\) values for the current \(b\).

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case when \(b = 1\) by initializing `ans` to `n`.
   - For \(b > 1\), the logic to calculate the number of valid \(a\) values is based on the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The formula `g = int(n / count)` is used to find the maximum possible value of \(a\) that can satisfy the condition. This is a reasonable approach, but the subsequent calculations might not be entirely clear or correct.
   - The condition `if g < countmins:` might be too restrictive and could lead to missing valid pairs.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The logic inside the loop might not correctly count the number of valid pairs for \(b > 1\).
   - The formula `g = int(n / count)` and the subsequent calculations might not accurately capture the required condition.
   - The update `ans += int(g / count) + 1` might not be the correct way to count the valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of the problem and the potential issues in the logic inside the loop, the program does not seem to correctly implement the required solution. The specific logic for counting valid pairs for \(b > 1\) is not clear and might be incorrect.

Final: **False**
