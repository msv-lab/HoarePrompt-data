The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to `n` and `m` after converting them to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0

After executing the code snippet, the values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the user input. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user input, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
