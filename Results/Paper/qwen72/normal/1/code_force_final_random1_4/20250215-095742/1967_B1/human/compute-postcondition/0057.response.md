Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1 + int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `int(n / 4)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `int(n / 4)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
