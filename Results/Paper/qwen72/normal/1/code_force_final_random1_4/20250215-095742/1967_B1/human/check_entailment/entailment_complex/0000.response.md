Reasoning:  
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the requirements and the implementation:

1. **Problem Statement**: We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
   - \(1 \le a \le n\)
   - \(1 \le b \le m\)
   - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It then iterates from 2 to \(m\) (inclusive), updating `ans` based on a specific formula involving \(n\) and the current loop index \(k\).

3. **Key Points to Verify**:
   - **Initialization**: `ans` is initialized to \(n\), which is correct because for \(b = 1\), all \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) satisfy the condition \(a + 1\) being a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1)\).
   - **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates from 2 to \(m\). For each \(k\) (which represents \(b\)), it calculates:
     - `countmins` as \(k - 1\)
     - `g` as \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor\)
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, it updates `ans` by adding \(\left\lfloor \frac{g - (k - 1)}{k} \right\rfloor + 1\).

4. **Mathematical Verification**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     - \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - This implies that \(a\) must be of the form \(b \cdot d \cdot k - b\) where \(d\) is a divisor of \(a\).
   - The program's logic seems to correctly account for the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(b = 1\) correctly by initializing `ans` to \(n\).
   - The loop correctly breaks when no more valid pairs can be found.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
