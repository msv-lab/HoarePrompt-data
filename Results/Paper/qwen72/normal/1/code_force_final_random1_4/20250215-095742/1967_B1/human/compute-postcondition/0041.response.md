Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2)`, and the loop breaks before reaching `count = m + 1`.** 

The `break` statement causes the loop to terminate immediately, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged.
