### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For \(b = 1\), \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\), so all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid.
   - For \(b > 1\), the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is more restrictive. Specifically, \(a\) must be such that \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `count` to 2 and starts a loop from 2 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\) (starting from 2), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values.
   - It uses the formula `g = int(n / count)` to find the maximum possible value of \(a\) that can satisfy the condition.
   - It then checks if `g` is less than `count - 1`. If so, it breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates the answer by adding the number of valid \(a\) values for the current \(b\).

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case when \(b = 1\) by initializing `ans` to `n`.
   - For \(b > 1\), the logic to calculate the number of valid \(a\) values is based on the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The formula `g = int(n / count)` and the subsequent calculations are intended to find the number of valid \(a\) values for the current \(b\).
   - However, the specific logic inside the loop might not be entirely clear or correct. The formula `g = int(n / count)` and the subsequent calculations might not accurately capture the required condition.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The logic inside the loop might not correctly count the number of valid pairs for \(b > 1\).
   - The condition `if g < countmins:` might be too restrictive and could lead to missing valid pairs.
   - The formula `g = int(n / count)` and the subsequent calculations might not accurately capture the required condition.

6. **Verification with Example:**
   - Let's verify the program with the example provided:
     - For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the expected output is 14.
     - The program initializes `ans` to 10 (since all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid).
     - For \(b = 2\), the program calculates `g = int(10 / 2) = 5`. It then checks if `5 < 1`, which is false, so it updates `ans` by adding `int(5 / 2) + 1 = 3`.
     - For \(b = 3\), the program calculates `g = int(10 / 3) = 3`. It then checks if `3 < 2`, which is false, so it updates `ans` by adding `int(3 / 3) + 1 = 2`.
     - For \(b = 4\), the program calculates `g = int(10 / 4) = 2`. It then checks if `2 < 3`, which is false, so it updates `ans` by adding `int(2 / 4) + 1 = 1`.
     - For \(b = 5\), the program calculates `g = int(10 / 5) = 2`. It then checks if `2 < 4`, which is false, so it updates `ans` by adding `int(2 / 5) + 1 = 1`.
     - For \(b = 6\), the program calculates `g = int(10 / 6) = 1`. It then checks if `1 < 5`, which is false, so it updates `ans` by adding `int(1 / 6) + 1 = 1`.
     - For \(b = 7\), the program calculates `g = int(10 / 7) = 1`. It then checks if `1 < 6`, which is false, so it updates `ans` by adding `int(1 / 7) + 1 = 1`.
     - For \(b = 8\), the program calculates `g = int(10 / 8) = 1`. It then checks if `1 < 7`, which is false, so it updates `ans` by adding `int(1 / 8) + 1 = 1`.
     - The final value of `ans` is 10 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 19, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of the problem and the potential issues in the logic inside the loop, the program does not seem to correctly implement the required solution.

Final: **False**
