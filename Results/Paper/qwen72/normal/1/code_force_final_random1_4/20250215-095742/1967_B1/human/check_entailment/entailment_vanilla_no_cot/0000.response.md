Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as specified. The logic within the loop and the way it calculates the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` does not align with the conditions given in the problem statement. Specifically, the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not being properly checked or accounted for in the code. The solution seems to incrementally add values without ensuring that the pairs meet the required condition. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.
