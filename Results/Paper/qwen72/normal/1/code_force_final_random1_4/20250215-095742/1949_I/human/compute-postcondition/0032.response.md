Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers (potentially updated), `visited[i]` is `False` or `True` (unchanged from the precondition), `coef[1]` is set to 1 if `visited[i]` was `False` in the previous iteration, `coef[i]` is set to 1, `tot` is potentially incremented or modified, `bipartite` is potentially set to `False`, and `ok` is `True` if `tot` is not 0 or if `bipartite` is `True`.**
