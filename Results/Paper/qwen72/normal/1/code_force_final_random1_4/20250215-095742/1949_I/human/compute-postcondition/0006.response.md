To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(n):
```

The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - `i` is the loop variable that will take on values from `0` to `n-1` during each iteration of the loop.
   - Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to `0`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than `0`.

### Adjusted State:
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than `0`.
- The initial value of `i` should be `0`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, and `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`**.
