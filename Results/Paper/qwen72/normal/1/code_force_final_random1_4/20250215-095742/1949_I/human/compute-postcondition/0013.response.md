Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `tot` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `tot` is initialized to 0. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
