The code snippet `r = [None] * n` reassigns the variable `r` to a new list of `None` values with length `n`. This overrides the initial state where `r` was a list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `r` is now a list of `None` values with length `n`, `visited` is a list of booleans initialized to False for each element, and `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`.**
