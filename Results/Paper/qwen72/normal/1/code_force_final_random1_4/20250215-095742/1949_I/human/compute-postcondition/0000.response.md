The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user through the `input()` function. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers where for each i (0 ≤ i < n), x[i] and y[i] are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x[i], y[i] ≤ 10^9, and r[i] is an integer such that 1 ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9. `visited` is a list of booleans initialized to False for each element. `coef` is a list of None values with length n.**
