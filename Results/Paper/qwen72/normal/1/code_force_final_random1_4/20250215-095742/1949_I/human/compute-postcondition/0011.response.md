The code snippet `x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` respectively. Given that `i` is 2, the values of `x[2]`, `y[2]`, and `r[2]` are updated with the new input values.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x[0]` is an input integer, `y[0]` is an input integer, `r[0]` is an input integer, `x[1]` is an input integer, `y[1]` is an input integer, `r[1]` is an input integer, `x[2]` is an input integer, `y[2]` is an input integer, `r[2]` is an input integer, `x[3:n]` are `None`, `y[3:n]` are `None`, `r[3:n]` are `None`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`.**
