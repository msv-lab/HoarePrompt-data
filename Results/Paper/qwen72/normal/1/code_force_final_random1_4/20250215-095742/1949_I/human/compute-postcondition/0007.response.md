Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x[0]` is an input integer, `y[0]` is an input integer, `r[0]` is an input integer, `x[1:n]` are `None`, `y[1:n]` are `None`, `r[1:n]` are `None`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `x[0]`, `y[0]`, and `r[0]` respectively.
- Since `i` is 0, only the first elements of `x`, `y`, and `r` are updated.
- The rest of the elements in `x`, `y`, and `r` remain `None`.
- The other variables (`n`, `visited`, `coef`) remain unchanged.
