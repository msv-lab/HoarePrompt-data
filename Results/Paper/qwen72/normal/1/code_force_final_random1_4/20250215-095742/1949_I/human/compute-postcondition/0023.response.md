Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values except possibly `visited[0]` which may be `True`, `coef` is a list with the first element set to 1 and the rest might be updated, `tot` might be updated, `bipartite` might be `False`, `ok` is `True` if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains `False`.***
