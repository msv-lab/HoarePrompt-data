t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the number of cells in the ribbon. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is either 0 or 1, representing whether the i-th cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1). At least one cell in each test case contains a chip.
