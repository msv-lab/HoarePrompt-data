Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `z` is assigned the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` up to (but not including) index `n - y`.
- The initial state remains unchanged except for the new value of `z`.
- If `x` is -1 or `y` is -1, `z` will be an empty string because the slicing operation will not include any characters.
- The indices `x` and `n - y` are used to determine the start and end of the substring, respectively.
