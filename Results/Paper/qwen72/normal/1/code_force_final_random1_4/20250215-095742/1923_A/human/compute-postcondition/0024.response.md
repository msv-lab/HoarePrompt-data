The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the context given, it is implied that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the number of cells in the ribbon.
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is either 0 or 1, representing whether the i-th cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1). At least one cell in each test case contains a chip.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. The exact nature of the output is not specified in the problem statement, but it is implied that the function will return some form of result based on the configuration of the ribbon (list `a`) for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer representing the number of cells in the ribbon), and `a` (a list of integers representing the state of each cell in the ribbon). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the configuration of the ribbon.**
