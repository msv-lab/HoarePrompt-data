### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array of cells `arr`.

2. **String Conversion**:
   - The array `arr` is converted to a string by joining the elements after splitting the input. This is done to facilitate easier manipulation and searching within the string.

3. **Finding the First and Last Chip Positions**:
   - `x = arr.find('1')`: Finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' (the first chip).
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`: Finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string, which corresponds to the last occurrence of '1' in the original string.

4. **Extracting the Substring**:
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]`: Extracts the substring from the first chip to the last chip. This ensures that we are only considering the segment of the ribbon that contains all the chips.

5. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - `print(z.count('0'))`: Counts the number of '0's (free cells) in the extracted substring. This count represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `8\n0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
  - `arr = '01110110'`
  - `x = 1`, `y = 1` (last '1' is at index 6, so `n - y = 7`)
  - `z = '111011'`
  - `z.count('0') = 1`
  - Output: `1`

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `6\n0 1 0 0 0 0`
  - `arr = '010000'`
  - `x = 1`, `y = 5` (last '1' is at index 1, so `n - y = 1`)
  - `z = '1'`
  - `z.count('0') = 0`
  - Output: `0`

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `6\n1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - `arr = '111111'`
  - `x = 0`, `y = 0` (last '1' is at index 5, so `n - y = 6`)
  - `z = '111111'`
  - `z.count('0') = 0`
  - Output: `0`

- **Example 4**:
  - Input: `5\n1 0 1 0 1`
  - `arr = '10101'`
  - `x = 0`, `y = 1` (last '1' is at index 4, so `n - y = 4`)
  - `z = '1010'`
  - `z.count('0') = 2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Example 5**:
  - Input: `9\n0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
  - `arr = '011000110'`
  - `x = 1`, `y = 1` (last '1' is at index 7, so `n - y = 8`)
  - `z = '1100011'`
  - `z.count('0') = 3`
  - Output: `3`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. It handles all the given examples correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
