The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends solely on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be decremented by 1 but still remain greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from its previous value), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`**
