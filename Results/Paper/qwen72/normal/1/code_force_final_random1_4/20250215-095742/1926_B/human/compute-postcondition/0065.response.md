Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, the grid is represented by n lines of n characters, where each character is either '0' or '1', the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, `a` is the initial value of `a` (unchanged), `i` is `a - 1`, `b` is the last input string provided by the user, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in each input string `b` that contained at least one '1' during all iterations of the loop. If the first two elements of `k` are equal (`k[0] == k[1]`), the program has printed 'SQUARE' for each iteration where this condition was true. Otherwise, the program has printed 'TRIANGLE' for each iteration where this condition was false.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `t` remains within its initial bounds.
- The variable `n` remains within its initial bounds.
- The grid representation and the conditions it satisfies remain unchanged.
- The variable `a` retains its initial value.
- The loop index `i` will be `a - 1`, indicating that the loop has run `a` times.
- The variable `b` holds the last input string provided by the user.
- The list `k` contains the count of '1's in each input string that contained at least one '1' during all iterations of the loop.
- The program has printed 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' based on the comparison of the first two elements of `k` for each iteration.
