The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the `range(int(input()))` expression. For the loop to execute, the input provided by `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `grid`, `a`, `i`, `b`, and `k`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that controls the loop's execution. This means the user must provide an integer greater than 0 when prompted by `input()`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, the grid is represented by n lines of n characters, where each character is either '0' or '1', the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, `a` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is the last input string, `k` is an empty list, and the user input for the loop must be an integer greater than 0**
