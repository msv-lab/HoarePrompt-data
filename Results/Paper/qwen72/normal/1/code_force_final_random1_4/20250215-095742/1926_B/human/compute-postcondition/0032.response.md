Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, the grid is represented by n lines of n characters, where each character is either '0' or '1', the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, `a` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is the new input string, `k` is a list containing the number of '1's in `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of '1's in the string `b` to the list `k`.
- Since `k` was initially an empty list if `b` did not contain any '1's, or a list containing the number of '1's in `b` if it did, after executing the code, `k` now contains the number of '1's in `b`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, the grid, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged.
