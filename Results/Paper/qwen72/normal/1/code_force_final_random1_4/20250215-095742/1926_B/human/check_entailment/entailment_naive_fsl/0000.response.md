Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it only checks the counts of '1's in the first two rows that contain '1's to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle. This approach fails in cases where the shape is more complex or the '1's are distributed differently.

**Counterexample:**

Consider the following input:
```
1
4
0000
0100
1110
1110
```

Expected Output:
```
TRIANGLE
```

Actual Output:
```
SQUARE
```

In this case, the shape is an upside-down triangle, but the program incorrectly identifies it as a square because it only checks the first two rows containing '1's, which both have a count of 1. Therefore, the program does not correctly identify the shape in all cases.
