To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a temporary variable used to iterate over the range. The range is determined by `int(input())`.

2. **Input Requirement**: For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This means the user must provide a positive integer when prompted.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state provided includes:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10
   - The grid is represented by n lines of n characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'
   - The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1
   - `a` must be greater than 2
   - `i` is 2
   - `b` is the last input string read by the loop
   - `k` is an empty list

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. Therefore, the user must input a positive integer.
   - The other variables (`t`, `n`, `grid`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `k`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
The only adjustment needed is to ensure that the user inputs a positive integer when prompted. The other variables remain as they are.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, the grid is represented by n lines of n characters, where each character is either '0' or '1', the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, `a` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b` is the last input string read by the loop, `k` is an empty list, and the user must input a positive integer**.
