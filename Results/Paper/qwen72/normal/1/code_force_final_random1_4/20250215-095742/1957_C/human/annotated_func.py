#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, representing the number of moves already played. The function `func_1` should actually take more parameters to fully represent the problem, including the moves already played. However, based on the provided function definition, only `n` is given.
def func_1(n):
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: `n` must be at least `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `dp[5]` is 81, and so on up to `dp[n]` which is the value computed by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` as its parameter, representing the size of a chessboard. It computes and returns the value of `dp[n]`, where `dp` is a sequence defined by the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` with initial conditions `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. The function does not modify any external state and returns the computed value of `dp[n]`.
