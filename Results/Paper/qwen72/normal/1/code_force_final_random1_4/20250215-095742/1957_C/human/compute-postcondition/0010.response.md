Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` as its parameter, representing the size of a chessboard. It computes and returns the value of `dp[n]`, where `dp` is a sequence defined by the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` with initial conditions `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. The function does not modify any external state and returns the computed value of `dp[n]`. **
