Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program sets a high recursion limit and initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with `-1` values.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.
   - It initializes a set `invalid` to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.

2. **Processing Moves**:
   - For each of the `k` moves, it reads the coordinates `(r, c)` and adds both `r` and `c` to the `invalid` set. This ensures that the rows and columns where rooks are already placed are marked as invalid.

3. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the argument `300000` to precompute the DP values up to `300000`.
   - The function `func_1` initializes `dp[1]` to `1` and `dp[2]` to `3`.
   - It then iterates from `3` to `n` and computes `dp[i]` using the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - For each test case, it calculates the number of valid configurations by subtracting the number of invalid rows and columns from `n` and looking up the precomputed DP value.
   - It prints the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Issues and Observations**:
- The function `func_1` is called with a fixed value of `300000`, which is larger than the maximum possible value of `n` (which is `3 * 10^5`). This ensures that the DP array is precomputed for all possible values of `n`.
- The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements.
- The logic for marking invalid rows and columns and computing the final configurations is sound.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
