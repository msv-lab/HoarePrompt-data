To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`:** The loop starts with `i` set to 3, as specified in the `range(3, n + 1)`.
2. **Variable `n`:** For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 (since the loop starts at 3 and goes up to `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 2 to include 3 in the range).

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard.
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, representing the number of moves already played.
- `dp[1]` is 1.
- `dp[2]` is 3.

We need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`k`, `dp[1]`, and `dp[2]`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 3, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**
