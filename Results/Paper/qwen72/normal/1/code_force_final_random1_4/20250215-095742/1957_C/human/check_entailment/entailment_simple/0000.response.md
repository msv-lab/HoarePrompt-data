Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Recursion Limit**: The program sets the recursion limit to 400,000, which is necessary for handling large values of `n`. This is appropriate given the constraints.

2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array is initialized with `-1` for all indices up to 300,000. This is used to store the number of possible configurations for a given board size.

3. **Precomputation Function (`func_1`)**: The function `func_1` precomputes the number of configurations for board sizes from 1 to `n`. It initializes `dp[1]` to 1 and `dp[2]` to 3, and then iterates from 3 to `n` to fill the `dp` array using the formula:
   \[
   dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
   \]
   This formula is derived from the problem's constraints and is correct for calculating the number of valid configurations.

4. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case. For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`.

5. **Invalid Positions**: A set `invalid` is used to keep track of positions that are already occupied by rooks. For each move `(r, c)`, both `r` and `c` are added to the `invalid` set.

6. **Final Configuration Calculation**: The program calculates the number of valid configurations by subtracting the number of invalid positions from `n` and looking up the result in the `dp` array. The result is printed for each test case.

7. **Edge Case Handling**: The program ensures that the result is at least 1 by using `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`. This handles the case where all positions are invalid, ensuring the output is always valid.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The dynamic programming approach and the handling of invalid positions are appropriate and consistent with the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
