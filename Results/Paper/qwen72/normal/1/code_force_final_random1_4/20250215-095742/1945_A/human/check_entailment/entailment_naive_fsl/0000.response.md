Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of tents required is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The line `b += c` assumes that all universals can be used to satisfy the extroverts' requirement. However, this is not always the case. Universals can also be used to satisfy the introverts' requirement or to form tents with other universals.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is not clear and does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description. For example, it does not properly account for the cases where universals are used to form tents with introverts or other universals.

3. **Edge Case**: Consider the input `1 2 1`. According to the problem description:
   - 1 introvert needs 1 tent.
   - 2 extroverts need 1 tent with 3 people, but there is only 1 universal available.
   - The program should output `-1` because it is impossible to satisfy the extroverts' requirement with the available universals. However, the program does not handle this case correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and thus it is incorrect.
