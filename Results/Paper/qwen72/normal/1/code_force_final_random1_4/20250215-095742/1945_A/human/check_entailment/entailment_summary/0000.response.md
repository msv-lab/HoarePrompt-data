### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads lines from the standard input starting from the second line, which is appropriate since the first line contains the number of test cases.
   - Each line is split into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Logic for Tents Calculation:**
   - The function adds the number of universals (`c`) to the number of extroverts (`b`). This is because universals can be used to fill the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts.
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` is used to calculate the number of tents needed. Here, `-b // 3` effectively calculates the ceiling of `b / 3` (since `-b // 3` is equivalent to `-(b // 3)` which is the ceiling of `b / 3` when `b` is positive).
   - The result is then adjusted by adding `a` (the number of introverts), as each introvert requires a separate tent.

3. **Condition for Impossibility:**
   - The condition `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` checks if the number of universals (`c`) is less than the remainder when `b` is divided by 3 (`b % 3`). If this condition is true, it means there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts, making it impossible to satisfy all preferences, and the function outputs `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `a`, `b`, and `c` are all zero, which correctly outputs `0`.
   - It also handles large inputs up to \(10^9\) and multiple test cases up to \(10^4\).

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is the expected behavior as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed or outputs `-1` if it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The logic and conditions are sound and handle all specified edge cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
