Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the logic and implementation step by step.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - Each player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The key insight is that the game is determined by the parity (odd/even nature) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob will always win because he can mirror Alice's moves.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice will always win because she can force Bob into a losing position.

### Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`
- This function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.
- It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
- If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
- If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

This function correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Function 2: `func_2()`
- This function handles multiple test cases.
- It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner, and appends the result to a list.
- Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Input/Output Handling
- The function `func_2()` correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- It prints the results in the required format.

### Verification
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

#### Example Input
```
10
1 1
1 4
5 3
4 5
11 9
83 91
1032 9307
839204 7281
1000000000 1000000000
53110 2024
```

#### Expected Output
```
Bob
Alice
Bob
Alice
Bob
Bob
Alice
Alice
Bob
Bob
```

#### Actual Output
- For each test case, `func_1(a, b)` is called to determine the winner based on the parity of `(a + b)`.
- The results are collected and printed.

### Detailed Check
- For `a = 1` and `b = 1`, `(a + b) % 2 == 0` → `Bob`
- For `a = 1` and `b = 4`, `(a + b) % 2 != 0` → `Alice`
- For `a = 5` and `b = 3`, `(a + b) % 2 == 0` → `Bob`
- For `a = 4` and `b = 5`, `(a + b) % 2 != 0` → `Alice`
- For `a = 11` and `b = 9`, `(a + b) % 2 == 0` → `Bob`
- For `a = 83` and `b = 91`, `(a + b) % 2 == 0` → `Bob`
- For `a = 1032` and `b = 9307`, `(a + b) % 2 != 0` → `Alice`
- For `a = 839204` and `b = 7281`, `(a + b) % 2 != 0` → `Alice`
- For `a = 1000000000` and `b = 1000000000`, `(a + b) % 2 == 0` → `Bob`
- For `a = 53110` and `b = 2024`, `(a + b) % 2 == 0` → `Bob`

The actual output matches the expected output for all test cases.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given rules and handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
