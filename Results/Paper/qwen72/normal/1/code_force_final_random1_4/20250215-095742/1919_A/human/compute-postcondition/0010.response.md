The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the value `t`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 1, and `_` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs.

At the start of the next iteration, `_` should be incremented by 1, and `t` should be decremented by 1 for the loop to potentially execute again.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing three elements, the first being the result of `func_1(a, b)` from the initial state, the second being the new result of `func_1(a, b)` after updating `a` and `b` with new integer values from user input, and the third being the new result of `func_1(a, b)` after updating `a` and `b` (which is also stored in `winner`), `a` and `b` are now updated with new integer values from user input, `winner` is the new result of `func_1(a, b)` after updating `a` and `b`.**
