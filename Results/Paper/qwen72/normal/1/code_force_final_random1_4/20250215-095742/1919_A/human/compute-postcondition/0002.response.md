To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the conditions within the loop head, which in this case is the variable `_` and the range defined by `t`.

1. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the range `range(t)`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 because `range(t)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `t-1`, and if `t` is 0 or negative, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given that `t` is the integer value entered by the user, and it is not specified whether `t` is already validated to be positive, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0. The other variables (`a`, `b`, and `results`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**
