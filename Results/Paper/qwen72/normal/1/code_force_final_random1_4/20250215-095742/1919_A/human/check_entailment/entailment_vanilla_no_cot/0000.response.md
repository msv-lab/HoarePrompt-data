Correctness: **True**

The provided functions correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_1` determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets. This approach is valid because the game essentially boils down to whether the total number of moves (which is `a + b - 1` since each player removes one coin per turn until one wallet is empty) is odd or even. If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob wins because he will be the one to make the last move. If it is odd, Alice wins because she will be the one to make the last move. The implementation in `func_1` and the handling of multiple test cases in `func_2` are both correct and align with the problem's requirements.
