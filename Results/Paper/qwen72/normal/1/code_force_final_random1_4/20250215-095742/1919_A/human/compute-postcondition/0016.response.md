Initial State: `results` is a list containing at least one element.

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. The `print(result)` statement is trying to print the value of the variable `result`.
2. However, there is no variable named `result` defined in the initial state. The only variable mentioned is `results`, which is a list containing at least one element.
3. Since `result` is not defined, attempting to print it will result in a `NameError`.

Therefore, the code will raise an error and will not print anything.

Output: **NameError: name 'result' is not defined**
