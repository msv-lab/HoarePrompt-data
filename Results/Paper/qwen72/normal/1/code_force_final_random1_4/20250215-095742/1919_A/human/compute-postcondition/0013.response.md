Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing four elements, the first being the result of `func_1(a, b)` from the initial state, the second being the new result of `func_1(a, b)` after updating `a` and `b` with new integer values from user input, the third being the new result of `func_1(a, b)` after updating `a` and `b` (which is also stored in `winner`), and the fourth being the value of `winner`. `a` and `b` are now updated with new integer values from user input, `winner` is the new result of `func_1(a, b)` after updating `a` and `b`.**
