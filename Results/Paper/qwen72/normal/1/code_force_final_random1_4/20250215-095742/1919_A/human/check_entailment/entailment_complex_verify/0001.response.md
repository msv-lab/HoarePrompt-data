Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's re-evaluate the logic and the implementation step by step, using the annotated code and the original assessment as a guide.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - Each player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The key insight is that the game is determined by the parity (odd/even nature) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob will always win because he can mirror Alice's moves.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice will always win because she can force Bob into a losing position.

### Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`
- This function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.
- It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
- If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
- If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

This function correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Function 2: `func_2()`
- This function handles multiple test cases.
- It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner, and appends the result to a list.
- Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Input/Output Handling
- The function `func_2()` correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- It prints the results in the required format.

### Verification Using Annotated Code
- **Initial State**: The program starts by calling `func_2()`.
- **Inside `func_2()`**:
  - `t` is read from the input, representing the number of test cases.
  - A list `results` is initialized to store the results of each test case.
  - For each test case, `a` and `b` are read from the input.
  - `func_1(a, b)` is called to determine the winner, and the result is appended to `results`.
  - After processing all test cases, the results are printed one by one.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given rules and handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
