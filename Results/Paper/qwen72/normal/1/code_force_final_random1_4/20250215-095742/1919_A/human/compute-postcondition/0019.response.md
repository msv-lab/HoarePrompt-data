The only object in the loop head is the variable `result` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If `results` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least two elements, and `result` will be the second element in the list.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least two elements, `result` is the second element in the list**
