The only object in the loop head is the variable `result` and the list `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `results` must still contain at least one element that hasn't been iterated over yet. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least one element. For the loop to execute again, `results` must still contain at least one element, and `result` will be the next element in the list.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least one element**
