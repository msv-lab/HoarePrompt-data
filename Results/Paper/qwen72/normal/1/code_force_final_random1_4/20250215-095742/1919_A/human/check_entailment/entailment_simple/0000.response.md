Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_1` correctly determines the winner of the game based on the problem description and the examples provided.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Rules**:
   - Players take turns, starting with Alice.
   - On each turn, a player can either:
     - Swap wallets with the opponent.
     - Remove 1 coin from their current wallet.
   - A player loses if they cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet is empty).

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move to avoid losing.
   - The key observation is that the game is symmetric and can be reduced to a simple parity check of the sum of coins in both wallets.

### Parity Check:
- If the sum of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob will always win because he can mirror Alice's moves.
- If the sum of coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice will always win because she can force Bob into a position where he cannot make a valid move.

### Program Logic:
- `func_1(a, b)` checks if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`. If true, it returns 'Bob'. Otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.
- This logic aligns with the optimal play strategy described above.

### Test Cases:
- The provided test cases and their expected outputs match the logic implemented in `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins in both wallets. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
