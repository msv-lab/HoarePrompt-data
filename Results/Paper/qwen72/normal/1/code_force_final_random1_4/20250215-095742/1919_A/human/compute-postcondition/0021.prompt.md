Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations that were specified initially. `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration. For each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated with new integer values from user input, and `winner` holds the result of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration. The values of `a` and `b` are the last set of integers provided by the user input, and `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)` using these last values.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a list containing at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is a list containing at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is a list containing at least two elements, `result` is the second element in the list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
