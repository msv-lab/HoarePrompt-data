Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**. 

The function `func_1(a, b)` has been called with the integers `a` and `b` as arguments, and the result of this function call has been assigned to the variable `winner`. The other variables (`t`, `results`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
