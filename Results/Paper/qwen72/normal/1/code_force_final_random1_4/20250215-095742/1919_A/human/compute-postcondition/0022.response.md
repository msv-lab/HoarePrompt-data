The function `func_2` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it seems the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.

Since the output is not specified in the problem statement, I'll assume the function processes these inputs and returns some result based on `a` and `b` for each test case. However, without specific output details, I can only describe the parameters and the general structure of the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 1000). For each test case, `a` and `b` are positive integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
