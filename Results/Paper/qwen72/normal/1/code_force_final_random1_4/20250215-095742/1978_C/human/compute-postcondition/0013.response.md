The function `func_4` does not explicitly list parameters in its definition, but based on the provided output cases, it seems to involve two implicit parameters, `n` and `k`. These parameters are constrained such that `n` is a non-negative integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5, and `k` is a non-negative even integer up to 10^12. The function has three possible return scenarios:

- Case_1: The function returns the tuple `(0, 0)`.
- Case_2: The function returns the values `0, 0`.
- Case_3: The function returns the values of `n` and `k`, where `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `k` is an even non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^12. Additionally, a variable `max_k` is set to `n`, and `max_k` is always greater than or equal to `k`.

Functionality: **The function `func_4` implicitly accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `k` is a non-negative even integer up to 10^12. It returns either the tuple `(0, 0)` or the values `0, 0`, or the values of `n` and `k` along with setting `max_k` to `n`, ensuring `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
