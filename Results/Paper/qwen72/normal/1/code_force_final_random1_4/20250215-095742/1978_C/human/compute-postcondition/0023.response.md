Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - (n - 2) + 1`, `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)`, `c` is 3, `i` is `n - 4`, and `k` is not equal to 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged with their respective conditions still valid.
