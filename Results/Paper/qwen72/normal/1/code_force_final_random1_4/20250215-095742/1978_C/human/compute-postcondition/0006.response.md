The function `func_5(l)` is called with the argument `l`, which is the result of `func_1(n, k)`. Since the specifics of `func_5` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the program state or what it returns. However, we know that `func_5` is executed with `l` as its argument.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers assigned by `func_4()`, and 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12, and `n` is not equal to 0; `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`. The function `func_5(l)` has been called.**
