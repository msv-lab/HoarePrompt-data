### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation `p` of length `n` such that the Manhattan value of `p` equals `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).
   - If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **func_4:** This function reads the input values `n` and `k`, checks if `k` is even, and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. It returns `(n, k)` if valid, otherwise `(0, 0)`.
   - **func_1:** This function attempts to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value. It uses a list `l` initialized to `[1, 2, ..., n]` and modifies it to achieve the required Manhattan value.
   - **func_2 and func_3:** These functions are helper functions used by `func_1` to swap elements in the list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - **func_5:** This function prints the permutation if a valid one is found.
   - **func_6:** This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to get valid `n` and `k`, then calls `func_1` to generate the permutation, and finally calls `func_5` to print the result.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **func_4:** The logic for checking if `k` is even and calculating the maximum possible Manhattan value is correct. The maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is indeed \(\frac{n^2}{2}\) for even `n` and \(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\) for odd `n`.
   - **func_1:** The function attempts to construct the permutation by swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value. However, the logic for adjusting the Manhattan value by swapping elements is not straightforward and may not always produce the correct result.
   - **func_2 and func_3:** These functions perform specific swaps to adjust the Manhattan value. The logic here seems to be correct but needs to be carefully verified.
   - **func_5 and func_6:** These functions handle the output and orchestration, which appear to be correct.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The logic in `func_1` for constructing the permutation might not always produce the correct result, especially for larger values of `n` and `k`.
   - The condition `if k < i - 1:` in `func_1` might not correctly handle all edge cases.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of the problem and the potential issues in the construction logic of `func_1`, the provided program may not always produce the correct permutation for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
