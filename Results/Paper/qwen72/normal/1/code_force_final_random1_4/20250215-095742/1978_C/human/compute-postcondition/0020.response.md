The given Python code snippet updates the value of `l` by calling the function `func_3(c, l)`. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `k` is defined as `k - (n - 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `k - n + 3`. However, since `k` is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to 1, this definition remains unchanged.
- `l` was initially the result of `func_3(1, l)`, but now it is updated to the result of `func_3(c, l)`, where `c` is 2.
- `c` remains 2.
- `i` remains `n - 2`.
- The conditions for returning values based on `k` are still valid, but no return occurs in this snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - (n - 2) + 1`, `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, `c` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, and `k` is not equal to 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. If `k` is 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(1, l)`. If `k` is less than `i - 1`, the program returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`.**
