Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `k` in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` divides `k` by 2, which is not appropriate for the problem. The Manhattan value calculation involves absolute differences, and dividing `k` by 2 does not align with the required logic.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The loop in `func_1` iterates from `n` to `-1` with a step of `-2`, which is incorrect. The loop should iterate over the elements of the permutation in a way that allows for the correct manipulation of the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

3. **Incorrect Swapping in `func_2` and `func_3`:**
   - The functions `func_2` and `func_3` perform swaps that do not necessarily lead to the correct permutation. The swapping logic needs to be carefully designed to ensure that the Manhattan value is correctly adjusted.

4. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum `k` in `func_4`:**
   - The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is `n * (n - 1)`. The current logic in `func_4` calculates a different value, which is incorrect.

5. **Handling of Odd and Even `n` in `func_4`:**
   - The logic for handling odd and even `n` is incorrect. The maximum `k` should be calculated uniformly as `n * (n - 1)`.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The output format in `func_5` is correct, but the overall logic leading to this output is flawed.

To fix these issues, the program needs a more structured approach to generate the permutation and ensure the correct Manhattan value. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_permutation(n, k):
    if k > n * (n - 1):
        return None
    if k % 2 != 0:
        return None

    perm = list(range(1, n + 1))
    k //= 2
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        if k >= i:
            perm[i], perm[i - 1] = perm[i - 1], perm[i]
            k -= i
        else:
            break
    return perm

def solve_test_case():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    perm = find_permutation(n, k)
    if perm is None:
        print("No")
    else:
        print("Yes")
        print(*perm)

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        solve_test_case()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version ensures that the permutation is generated correctly and the Manhattan value is achieved as specified.
