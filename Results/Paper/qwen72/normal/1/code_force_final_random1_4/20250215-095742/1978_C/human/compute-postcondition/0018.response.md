Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k // 2 - (n - 2) + 1`, `l` is the result of `func_3(1, l)`, `c` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, and `k` is not equal to 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. If `k` is 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(1, l)`. If `k` is less than `i - 1`, the program returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`.***
