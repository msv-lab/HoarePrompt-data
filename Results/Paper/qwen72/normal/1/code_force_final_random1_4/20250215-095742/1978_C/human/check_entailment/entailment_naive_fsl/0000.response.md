Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is odd. According to the problem description, the Manhattan value `k` must be achievable by a permutation of length `n`. However, the function `func_4` immediately returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd, which means the program will always output "NO" for any odd `k`, even if a valid permutation exists. For example, for the input `n = 3` and `k = 4`, a valid permutation `[3, 1, 2]` exists, but the program will incorrectly output "NO" because `k` is odd. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
