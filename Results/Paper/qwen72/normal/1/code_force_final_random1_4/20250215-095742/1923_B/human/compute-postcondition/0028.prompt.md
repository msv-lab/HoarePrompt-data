Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster relative to the player's position, `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second, `n` is the length of the list `a` (which is also the length of the list `x`), `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from 0 to `n-1` sorted based on the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, `pos` is 0, `len(sorted_indices) > 0`, `rest` is `k`, and the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is not equal to `distance`.
Code of the loop:
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
    delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
    rest -= delta
    a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
    if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
        pos += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, then `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is reduced by `delta` and is now 0, and `pos` is incremented to 1. `rest` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster relative to the player's position, `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second, `n` is the length of the list `a` (which is also the length of the list `x`), `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from 0 to `n-1` sorted based on the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, `len(sorted_indices) > 0`, and the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is not equal to `distance`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`delta` is the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` depending on whether `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0. `rest` is now `rest - delta`, and either `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is reduced by `delta`. `x` is a list of integers, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is the length of `a` and `x`, `sorted_indices` is a list of indices sorted based on the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, `len(sorted_indices) > 0`, the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` or `x[sorted_indices[pos-2]]` (depending on the condition) is not equal to `distance`, and `pos` is incremented by 1 if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`delta` is the minimum value between `rest` and either `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` depending on the condition. `rest` is now `rest - delta - delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is reduced by `delta`; otherwise, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`. `x` is a list of integers, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is the length of `a` and `x`, `sorted_indices` is a list of indices sorted based on the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, `len(sorted_indices) > 0`, and the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos-2]]` or `x[sorted_indices[pos-3]]` (depending on the condition) is not equal to `distance`. `pos` is incremented by 1 if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
