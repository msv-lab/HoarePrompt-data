The code snippet `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into separate strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` and `k` are input integers
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user

After executing the code snippet, the list `x` will contain the integers entered by the user. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is a list of integers input by the user.**
