Output State: **All monsters whose health could be reduced to 0 with the available bullets have been defeated. The `rest` variable is now 0, indicating that there are no more bullets left to fire. The `pos` variable is equal to the length of `sorted_indices`, indicating that all monsters have been processed. The `a` list contains the remaining health of each monster, where all elements are 0 if all monsters have been defeated. The `distance` variable is equal to the number of iterations the loop executed, which is the maximum distance at which the last monster was defeated. The `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` variables remain unchanged.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- All monsters that could be defeated with the available bullets have been defeated.
- There are no more bullets left (`rest` is 0).
- All monsters have been processed (`pos` is equal to the length of `sorted_indices`).
- The `a` list shows the remaining health of each monster, with all elements being 0 if all monsters have been defeated.
- The `distance` variable indicates the maximum distance at which the last monster was defeated.
- The `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` variables remain unchanged from their initial values.
