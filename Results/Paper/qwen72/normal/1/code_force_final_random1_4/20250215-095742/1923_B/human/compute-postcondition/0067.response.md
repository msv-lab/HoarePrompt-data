Output State: **`rest` is `k - delta`, `pos` is the index of the next monster in `sorted_indices` with health greater than 0 and must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`, `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, all other variables remain unchanged.** 

Explanation: The value of `delta` is updated to the minimum of `rest` and the value at the position `sorted_indices[pos]` in the array `a`. The conditions for `rest` and `pos` remain unchanged, and no other variables are affected.
