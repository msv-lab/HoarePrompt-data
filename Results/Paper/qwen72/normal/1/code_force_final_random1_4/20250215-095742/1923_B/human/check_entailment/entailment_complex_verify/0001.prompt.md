You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Output

    YES

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

The lengths of a and x are equal, and for all elements x_i in x, x_i ≠ 0.

    #State: All monsters whose health could be reduced to 0 with the available bullets have been defeated. The `rest` variable is now 0, indicating that there are no more bullets left to fire. The `pos` variable is equal to the length of `sorted_indices`, indicating that all monsters have been processed. The `a` list contains the remaining health of each monster, where all elements are 0 if all monsters have been defeated. The `distance` variable is equal to the number of iterations the loop executed, which is the maximum distance at which the last monster was defeated. The `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` variables remain unchanged.
    return True
    #The program returns True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `a`, a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster; `x`, a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster relative to the player's position; and `k`, a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second. The function processes the monsters in order of their proximity to the player, reducing their health with the available bullets until either all monsters are defeated or a monster reaches the player's position. If any monster reaches the player's position before being defeated, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, if all monsters are defeated before reaching the player, the function returns `True`. After the function concludes, the `a` list contains the remaining health of each monster, which will be all zeros if all monsters were defeated. The `x` and `k` parameters remain unchanged.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 * 10^4. n and k are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 * 10^9. a is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. x is a list of n distinct integers sorted in ascending order where -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.

    t = int(input())

        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')
        
    #State: `t` must be equal to the initial value of `t`, `_` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is a list of integers input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads multiple sets of inputs from the user, each set consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, a list of integers `a`, and a list of distinct integers `x`. For each set, it calls another function `func_1` with `a`, `x`, and `k` as arguments and prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns True, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function processes `t` sets of inputs, where `t` is a positive integer provided initially. After processing all sets, the function terminates without returning any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have `n` monsters, each with a health `a_i` and a position `x_i`.
   - Every second, we can fire up to `k` bullets, each reducing a monster's health by 1.
   - Monsters move 1 unit closer to the player each second.
   - The player loses if any monster reaches position 0.
   - The goal is to determine if it's possible to kill all monsters before any of them reach the player.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - **Sorting by Distance**: The function `func_1` sorts the monsters by their absolute distance from the player. This ensures that we prioritize killing the closest monsters first, which is a good strategy because they pose the greatest immediate threat.
   - **Distance Tracking**: The variable `distance` keeps track of how many seconds have passed, which is equivalent to the distance the closest monster has moved towards the player.
   - **Bullet Allocation**: The inner loop allocates up to `k` bullets to the monsters in the order of their sorted indices. If a monster's health drops to 0, it is considered dead, and we move to the next monster.
   - **Termination Condition**: The function returns `False` if any monster reaches the player (i.e., `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`). Otherwise, it continues until all monsters are dead.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Monster**: If there is only one monster, the function correctly checks if it can be killed within its distance to the player.
   - **Multiple Monsters**: The function handles multiple monsters by ensuring that the closest monsters are prioritized and that the player has enough bullets to kill them before they reach the player.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - **Function 2**: The function `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the result. It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.

5. **Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\), and the subsequent processing is \(O(n)\) per test case. Given the constraints, this is efficient.
   - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the storage of the monster data and the sorted indices.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters. The algorithm is sound and handles the problem constraints effectively.
