Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All monsters whose health could be reduced to 0 with the available bullets have been defeated. The `rest` variable is now equal to `k`. The `pos` variable points to the next monster in the `sorted_indices` list that still has health greater than 0, and `pos` must not be equal to the length of `sorted_indices`. The `a` list contains the remaining health of each monster, where some elements may be 0 if those monsters have been defeated. The `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, and `len(sorted_indices)` variables remain unchanged. The `distance` variable is now `distance + 1`. If the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` equals `distance`, the program returns False.
Code of the loop:
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
    delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
    rest -= delta
    a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
    if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
        pos += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *All monsters whose health could be reduced to 0 with the available bullets have been defeated. The `rest` variable is now equal to `k - delta`. The `pos` variable points to the next monster in the `sorted_indices` list that still has health greater than 0, and if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, `pos` is incremented by 1. The `a` list contains the remaining health of each monster, where some elements may be 0 if those monsters have been defeated. The `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, and `len(sorted_indices)` variables remain unchanged. The `distance` variable is now `distance + 1`. The `delta` variable is now the minimum of the original `rest` (which was `k`) and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos - 1]]` if `pos` was incremented. The health of the monster at position `sorted_indices[pos]` or `sorted_indices[pos - 1]` in the `a` list is now `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta` or 0 if `pos` was incremented.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`rest` is `k - 2 * delta`, `pos` is the index of the next monster in `sorted_indices` with health greater than 0 and must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `pos` is incremented by 1, and `delta` is updated to the minimum of `rest` before the subtraction and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, with `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` being reduced by `delta`. Otherwise, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`. All other variables remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`rest` is `k - 3 * delta`, `pos` is the index of the next monster in `sorted_indices` with health greater than 0 and must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `pos` is incremented by 1, and `delta` is updated to the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos - 1]]`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos - 1]]` is reduced by `delta`. Otherwise, `delta` is updated to the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`. All other variables remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
