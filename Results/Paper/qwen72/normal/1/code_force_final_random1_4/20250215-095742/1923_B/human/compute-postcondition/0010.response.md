The code snippet `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into parts based on whitespace, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `_` is 1
- `n` and `k` are input integers
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user
- `x` is a list of integers input by the user

After executing the code, the variable `x` is updated to a new list of integers provided by the user.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is a new list of integers input by the user.**
