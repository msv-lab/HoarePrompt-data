Postcondition: ***`delta` is the minimum value between `rest` and either `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` depending on the condition. `rest` is now `rest - delta - delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is reduced by `delta`; otherwise, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`. `x` is a list of integers, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is the length of `a` and `x`, `sorted_indices` is a list of indices sorted based on the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, `len(sorted_indices) > 0`, and the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos-2]]` or `x[sorted_indices[pos-3]]` (depending on the condition) is not equal to `distance`. `pos` is incremented by 1 if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0.***
