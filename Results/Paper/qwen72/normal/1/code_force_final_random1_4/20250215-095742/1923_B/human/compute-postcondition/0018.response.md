The function `func_2` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`. 

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 * 10^4.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 * 10^9.
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `x` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order where -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given parameters. However, the specific output conditions are not provided in the prompt. Therefore, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`, and returns a result based on the processing of these parameters.**
