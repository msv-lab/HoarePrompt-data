The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` is 0. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be 1 and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is a list of integers input by the user**
