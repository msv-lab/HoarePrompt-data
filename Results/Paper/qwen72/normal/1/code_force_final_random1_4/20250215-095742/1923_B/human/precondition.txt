a is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, x is a list of distinct integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, k is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second, and the length of a and x are the same and represent the number of monsters n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5. Additionally, -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
