You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly handles the constraints as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The variables `start` and `end` are initialized to `-1` and `1000000000.0` respectively. These represent the minimum and maximum possible values for `k` based on the constraints.

2. **Reading Constraints**: The program reads `n` constraints and updates `start` and `end` accordingly:
   - For type 1 constraints (`k >= x`), `start` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
   - For type 2 constraints (`k <= x`), `end` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
   - For type 3 constraints (`k != x`), the value `x` is added to the list `num`.

3. **Counting Invalid Values**: The program counts how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`. This is necessary because these values are explicitly excluded by the type 3 constraints.

4. **Final Calculation**: The program calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the count of invalid values from the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]`. If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0, indicating no valid integers.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases such as when `start` is greater than `end` (returning 0) and when there are no invalid values in the range (returning the full range size).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
