isOne is a boolean value. However, this function definition does not align with the problem description provided. The problem requires a function to solve for the number of integers k that satisfy all given constraints, but the provided function `input_n` seems unrelated to the problem's requirements. A correct function definition should accept the number of test cases and the constraints as inputs.
