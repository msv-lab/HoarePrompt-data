Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 2, `t` is the first integer from the new input, `v` is the second integer from the new input, `num`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged based on their initial conditions. If `t` == 1 and `start` < `v`, then `start` is updated to be equal to `v`. `end` is now equal to `v`.** 

Explanation: The value of `end` is updated to be equal to `v`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `t`, `v`, `num`, `start`) remain unchanged unless `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`, in which case `start` is also updated to `v`.
