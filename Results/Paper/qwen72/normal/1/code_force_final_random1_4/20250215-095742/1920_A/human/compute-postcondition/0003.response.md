Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, and `num` is an empty list.**

The code snippet `num = []` reassigns the variable `num` to an empty list, which was already its initial value. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged.
