The value `v` is appended to the list `num`. The other conditions and variables (`n`, `i`, `t`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 1, `t` is the first integer from input, `v` is the second integer from input, `num` contains `v`, and `start` and `end` remain unchanged based on their initial conditions.**
