Functionality: **The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It returns 0 if the conditions for calculating the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num` are not met. Otherwise, it returns the calculated difference if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`. Here, `start` is the highest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 1, or -1 if no such `v` was greater than -1. `end` is the lowest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 2, or 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was less than 1000000000.0. `count_num` is the total number of elements in `num` that are within the range defined by `start` and `end` (inclusive).**
