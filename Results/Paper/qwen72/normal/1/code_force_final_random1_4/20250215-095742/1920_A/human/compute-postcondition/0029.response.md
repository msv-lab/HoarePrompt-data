The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 2, `t` is the first integer from input, and `v` is the second integer from input. If `t` == 3, `num` contains `v`, and `start` and `end` remain unchanged based on their initial conditions. Otherwise, if `t` == 2 and `end` > `v`, `end` is updated to `v`. If `t` == 1 and `start` < `v`, `start` is updated to `v`. If none of these conditions apply, `start` and `end` remain unchanged.**
