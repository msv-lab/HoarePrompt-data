Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < n, representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
