Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is an empty list, `j` is `l`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(l):
    ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the letter corresponding to the count of the first element in `rev_array` minus 1, `j` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the letter corresponding to the count of the first element in `rev_array` minus 1, and the second element is the letter corresponding to the count of the second element in `rev_array` minus 1, `j` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer that must be greater than 2, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing three elements: the first element is the letter corresponding to the count of the first element in `rev_array` minus 1, the second element is the letter corresponding to the count of the second element in `rev_array` minus 1, and the third element is the letter corresponding to the count of the third element in `rev_array` minus 1, `j` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
