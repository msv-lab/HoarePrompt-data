Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing the letters corresponding to the counts of each element in `rev_array` starting from the end of `rev_array` up to the beginning, `j` is `l`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will contain a list of letters. Each letter corresponds to the count of the respective element in `rev_array` starting from the end of the list and moving towards the beginning. The variable `j` will be equal to `l`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `array`, `alp`, and `rev_array`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
