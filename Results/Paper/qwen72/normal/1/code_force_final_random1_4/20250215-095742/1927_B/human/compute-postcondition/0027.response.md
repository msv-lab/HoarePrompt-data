To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is an input integer.
   - `array` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
   - `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'.
   - `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.
   - `ans` is a list containing `l` elements where each element is the letter corresponding to the count of the respective element in `rev_array` minus 1.
   - `j` is `l-1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `array` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.
   - `ans` is constructed such that each element in `ans` corresponds to a letter in the alphabet based on the count of the respective element in `rev_array` minus 1.

3. **Constructing `ans`:**
   - For each element in `rev_array`, we find its count in `rev_array`.
   - We then map this count minus 1 to a letter in the alphabet.
   - The resulting list `ans` contains these letters.

4. **Printing the Result:**
   - The `print` statement joins the elements of `ans` into a single string and prints it.

Let's go through an example to illustrate this:

Suppose the user inputs:
- `l = 5`
- `array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`

Then:
- `rev_array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`
- Count of each element in `rev_array`:
  - 1 appears 2 times
  - 2 appears 2 times
  - 3 appears 1 time

- Constructing `ans`:
  - For the first element in `rev_array` (which is 1), the count is 2, so `ans[0] = alp[2-1] = 'b'`.
  - For the second element in `rev_array` (which is 2), the count is 2, so `ans[1] = alp[2-1] = 'b'`.
  - For the third element in `rev_array` (which is 3), the count is 1, so `ans[2] = alp[1-1] = 'a'`.
  - For the fourth element in `rev_array` (which is 2), the count is 2, so `ans[3] = alp[2-1] = 'b'`.
  - For the fifth element in `rev_array` (which is 1), the count is 2, so `ans[4] = alp[2-1] = 'b'`.

Thus, `ans = ['b', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'b']`.

Finally, the `print` statement will join these elements into a single string:
```python
print(''.join(map(str, ans)))
```
Output: **bbabb**

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **bbabb (where the string is constructed based on the counts of elements in the reversed array mapped to letters in the alphabet)**
