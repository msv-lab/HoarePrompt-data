Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `i` is 2.
3. `array` is a list of integers provided by user input.
4. `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'.
5. `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.
6. `ans` is a list containing the letters corresponding to the counts of each element in `rev_array` starting from index `j` (which ranges from 0 to `l-1`) in the `alp` list.
7. `j` is `l`.
8. `l` is an input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(map(str, ans)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Reversing the Array:**
   - `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`. If `array` is `[1, 2, 3]`, then `rev_array` will be `[3, 2, 1]`.

2. **Mapping Elements to Alphabet:**
   - `ans` is a list that contains letters from the `alp` list based on the elements in `rev_array`.
   - The index `j` starts from `l` and ranges from 0 to `l-1`.
   - For each element in `rev_array`, the corresponding letter in `alp` is determined by the element's value.

3. **Constructing the `ans` List:**
   - Suppose `rev_array` is `[3, 2, 1]` and `l` is 3.
   - `j` starts from 3 and goes down to 0.
   - For each element in `rev_array`:
     - `rev_array[0]` is 3, so `ans[0]` is `alp[3]` which is 'd'.
     - `rev_array[1]` is 2, so `ans[1]` is `alp[2]` which is 'c'.
     - `rev_array[2]` is 1, so `ans[2]` is `alp[1]` which is 'b'.
   - Therefore, `ans` will be `['d', 'c', 'b']`.

4. **Joining and Printing:**
   - The `print` statement joins the elements of `ans` into a single string and prints it.
   - `''.join(map(str, ans))` will convert each element of `ans` to a string and join them without any separator.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the steps above, the output will be a string of letters corresponding to the elements in `rev_array` mapped to the `alp` list.

Output: **'dcba' (where the exact letters depend on the values in `rev_array` and the length `l`)**

Note: The exact letters in the output will vary depending on the specific values in `array` and the length `l` provided by the user. The example assumes `array = [1, 2, 3]` and `l = 3`.
