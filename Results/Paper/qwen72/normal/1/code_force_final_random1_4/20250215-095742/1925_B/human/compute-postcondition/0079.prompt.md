Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, and n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= x.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(int(input())):
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x
                 // i) == 0:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are updated to the values provided by the user input (with 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x), `q` is 0, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, and `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`, where `d` is a divisor of `x`. If no such divisor exists, `ans` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, and `ans` will be the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the conditions `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` for any divisor `i` of `x` within the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x))`. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, `ans` is the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies the conditions `x % i == 0`, `x - n * i >= 0`, `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, `x - n * (x // i) >= 0`, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` for any `i` in the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x))`. `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged, and `q` is incremented by the number of iterations the loop executed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
