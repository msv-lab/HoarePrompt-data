Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `x` must be at least 1, `ans` is the maximum of the original `ans` (which was 1) and `x // i` if the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)` holds true, otherwise `ans` remains 1. `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1, and `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, if the condition holds true, `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `x // i`, and `x // i` is greater than 0.***
