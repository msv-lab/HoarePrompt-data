Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `x` must be at least 1, `ans` is the maximum of the original `ans` (which was 1) and `x // 2` if the condition `x - n * (x // 2) >= 0 and (x - n * (x // 2)) % (x // 2) == 0` holds true, otherwise `ans` remains 1. `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1, and `x` is divisible by 1. If the condition `x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0` holds true, `ans` is set to 2, and `x - n * (x // 1)` is non-negative and divisible by `x // 1`, and `x // 1` is greater than 0.***
