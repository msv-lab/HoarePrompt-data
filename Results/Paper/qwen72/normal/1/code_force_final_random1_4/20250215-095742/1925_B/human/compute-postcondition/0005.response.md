Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is updated to the values provided by the user input (with 1 <= n <= x), `q` is 0, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, the current value of `x - n * i` is non-negative and is divisible by `i`.**
