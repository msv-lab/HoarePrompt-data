To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.
   - The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` contains at least one element.
   - This means `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must be greater than 1.

3. **Check Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3 (not directly relevant to the loop).
   - `x` is an input integer between 1 and 10^8.
   - `n` is an input integer between 1 and `x` (not directly relevant to the loop).
   - `q` is 1 (not directly relevant to the loop).
   - `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` (this is the initial value of `i` outside the loop, but inside the loop, `i` will start from 1).
   - `ans` is 1 (not directly relevant to the loop).

4. **Adjust States for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must be greater than 1.
   - This simplifies to `int(sqrt(x)) >= 1`, which is always true for any `x` >= 1.
   - Therefore, the loop will always execute as long as `x` is at least 1.

5. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - The loop will execute if `x` is at least 1.
   - The initial value of `i` in the loop head should be 1.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an input integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an input integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 1, and `ans` is 1**.
