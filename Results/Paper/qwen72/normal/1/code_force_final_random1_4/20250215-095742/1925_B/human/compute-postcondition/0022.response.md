Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is at least 1, `n` is updated to the values provided by the user input (with \(1 \leq n \leq x\)), `q` is 0, `i` is 3, and `i` must be less than or equal to \( \text{int}(\sqrt{x}) + 1 \). If `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)`, then `ans` is set to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
