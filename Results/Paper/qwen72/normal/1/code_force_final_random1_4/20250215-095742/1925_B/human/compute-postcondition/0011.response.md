Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is updated to the values provided by the user input (with 1 <= n <= x), `q` is 0, `i` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, and if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `(x - n * (x // i))` is divisible by `(x // i)`, then `ans` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.***
