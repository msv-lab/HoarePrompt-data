The code snippet updates the values of `x` and `n` based on user input. The initial state specifies that `x` and `n` are updated to the values provided by the user input, with the constraints 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x. The other variables (`t`, `q`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an input integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an input integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, and `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`, where `d` is a divisor of `x`. If no such divisor exists, `ans` remains 1.**
