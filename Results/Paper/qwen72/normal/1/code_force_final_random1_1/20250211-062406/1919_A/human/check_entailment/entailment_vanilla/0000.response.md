### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing a coin from their wallets.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets with the other or keep their own.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally.

3. **Explanation of the Functions:**
   - **func_1(a, b):** This function determines the winner based on the sum of the coins. If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'; otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.
   - **func_2():** This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct because the parity of the total number of coins (a + b) determines the winner. If the sum is even, Bob will always win; if the sum is odd, Alice will always win.
   - The implementation in `func_2` correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.

Correctness: **True**
