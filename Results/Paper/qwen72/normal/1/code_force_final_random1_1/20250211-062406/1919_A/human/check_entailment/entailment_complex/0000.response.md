Reasoning:

The problem involves a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns removing a coin from their wallets, with the option to swap wallets. The player who cannot make a move loses. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the parity (odd/even nature) of the total number of coins (a + b).

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Input**: Two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
- **Logic**:
  - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, the function returns 'Bob'.
  - Otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.
- **Explanation**:
  - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, the game will end in a state where both players have an equal number of moves left. Since Alice starts, she will always be the one to make the last move, and Bob will win.
  - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will have one more move than Bob, ensuring that she can always force Bob into a losing position.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Input**: An integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
- **Logic**:
  - Reads `t` test cases.
  - For each test case, reads `a` and `b`.
  - Calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner.
  - Stores the result in a list `results`.
  - Prints each result in the list.
- **Explanation**:
  - The function correctly handles multiple test cases.
  - It reads the inputs and processes them using `func_1`.
  - The results are stored and printed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The logic in `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. The logic in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results as required by the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
