Reasoning:  
To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_1` correctly solves the problem as described. The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns, and the winner is determined by the parity (odd or even) of the sum of the coins in their wallets.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Logic**: The function `func_1(a, b)` checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
  - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns 'Bob'.
  - Otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.

### Game Logic:
- **Optimal Play**: Both players will always play optimally to avoid losing.
- **Turns and Moves**:
  - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
  - Each player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
  - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet is empty) loses.

### Parity Analysis:
- **Even Sum**: If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, the game will end in a way that Bob wins. This is because the total number of moves (each move reduces the total number of coins by 1) will be even, and since Alice starts, she will make the last move, leaving Bob to face an empty wallet.
- **Odd Sum**: If the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd, the game will end in a way that Alice wins. This is because the total number of moves will be odd, and since Alice starts, she will not be the one to face an empty wallet.

### Verification:
- **Test Cases**:
  - For `a = 1` and `b = 1`, the sum is 2 (even), so Bob wins.
  - For `a = 1` and `b = 4`, the sum is 5 (odd), so Alice wins.
  - For `a = 5` and `b = 3`, the sum is 8 (even), so Bob wins.
  - For `a = 4` and `b = 5`, the sum is 9 (odd), so Alice wins.
  - And so on...

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.

### Function `func_2`:
- **Reading Input**: It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
- **Storing Results**: It stores the results of each test case and prints them at the end.
- **Correct Behavior**: The function correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the parity of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
