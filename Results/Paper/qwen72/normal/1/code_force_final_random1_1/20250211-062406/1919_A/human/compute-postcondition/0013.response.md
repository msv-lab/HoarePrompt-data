Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner` and the new value of `winner` appended to it, `winner` remains the result of `func_1(a, b)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still greater than 0, decremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged and are still positive integers provided by the user within the range 1 to 10^9.
- The `results` list now contains the value of `winner` appended to it, making it a list with two elements, both being the result of `func_1(a, b)`.
- The value of `winner` remains the same, which is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.
