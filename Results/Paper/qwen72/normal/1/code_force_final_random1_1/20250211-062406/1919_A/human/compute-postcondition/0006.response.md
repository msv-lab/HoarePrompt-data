The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 but still remain greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**
