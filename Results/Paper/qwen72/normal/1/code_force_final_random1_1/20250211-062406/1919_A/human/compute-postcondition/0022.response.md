The function `func_2` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet, but based on the given parameter constraints, it seems to accept parameters `t`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, so we cannot determine the exact return value without additional context. However, based on typical programming patterns, it is likely that the function processes these inputs and returns some result based on the values of `a` and `b` for each of the `t` test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The function returns a result based on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case.**
