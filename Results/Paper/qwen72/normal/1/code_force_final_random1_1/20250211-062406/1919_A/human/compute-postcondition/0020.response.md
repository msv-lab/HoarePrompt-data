Based on the initial state:

- `t` is at least 1.
- `results` is a list containing at least three values.
- The first value in `results` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.
- `result` is the third value in the list `results`.

Given this information, the `print(result)` statement will print the third value in the list `results`.

Output: **result (where result is the third value in the list results)**
