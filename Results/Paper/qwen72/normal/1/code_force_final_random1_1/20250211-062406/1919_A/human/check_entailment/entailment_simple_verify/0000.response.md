Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The core of the game's logic hinges on the parity of the total number of coins (a + b). If the total is even, Bob will always win because he will be the one to make the last move, assuming optimal play. Conversely, if the total is odd, Alice will win because she will be the one to make the last move. The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and returning the appropriate winner. The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description, reading the inputs and printing the results correctly. The annotated code confirms that the program maintains the correct state throughout its execution, and the logic aligns with the problem's requirements.

Final: **True**
