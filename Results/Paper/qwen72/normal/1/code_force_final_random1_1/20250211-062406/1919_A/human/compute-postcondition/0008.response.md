Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0, decremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged and are still positive integers provided by the user within the range 1 to 10^9.
- The value of `winner` is updated to the result of the function `func_1(a, b)`.
- The list `results` still contains the value of `winner`, which is now the result of `func_1(a, b)`.
