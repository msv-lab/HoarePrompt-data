You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

    1000000000 1000000000

Output

    Bob
    Alice

    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `a` and `b` (where `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`), calls another function `func_1(a, b)`, and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints each result. The final state of the program is that `t` is the number of test cases processed, and the results of `func_1(a, b)` for each test case are printed.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing a coin from their wallets.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets with the other or keep their own.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally.

3. **Explanation of the Functions:**
   - **func_1(a, b):** This function determines the winner based on the sum of the coins. If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'; otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.
   - **func_2():** This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct because the parity of the total number of coins (a + b) determines the winner. If the sum is even, Bob will always win; if the sum is odd, Alice will always win.
   - The implementation in `func_2` correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.

Correctness: **True**
