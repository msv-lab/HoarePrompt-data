The values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the input provided by the user. The input is split into two parts, which are then converted to integers and assigned to `a` and `b`. The other variables (`t` and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `results` is an empty list**
