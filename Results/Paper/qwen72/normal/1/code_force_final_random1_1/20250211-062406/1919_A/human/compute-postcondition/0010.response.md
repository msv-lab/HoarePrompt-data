The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop will execute another iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `t` was greater than 0 and was decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner` and the new value of `winner` appended to it, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**
