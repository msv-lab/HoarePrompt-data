Postcondition: ***`numTest` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 0. If the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is less than 0, `stop` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains False.***
