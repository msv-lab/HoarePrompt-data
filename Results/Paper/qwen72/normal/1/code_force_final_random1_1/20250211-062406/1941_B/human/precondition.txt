t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the number of elements in the array. The array a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
