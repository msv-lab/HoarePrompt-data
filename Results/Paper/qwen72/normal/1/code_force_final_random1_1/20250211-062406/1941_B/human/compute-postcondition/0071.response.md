Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 4, `opNum` is `a[2]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - a[1]`, `a[1]` is `a[1] - 2 * a[1]` (and is less than 0), `a[2]` is `a[2] - 2 * a[1] - opNum` (and is less than 0), `a[3]` is `a[3] - a[1]`, and `stop` is True. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- `a[i] -= opNum` means `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] - opNum`.
- Since `opNum` is `a[2]`, `a[2]` becomes `a[2] - a[2]`, which simplifies to 0.
- However, before this operation, `a[2]` was already `a[2] - 2 * a[1]`, which is less than 0.
- After the operation, `a[2]` becomes `a[2] - 2 * a[1] - a[2]`, which simplifies to `-2 * a[1]`. Since `a[1]` is less than 0, `-2 * a[1]` is a positive value, but since `a[2]` was already less than 0, the final value of `a[2]` remains less than 0.
- The condition `if a[2] < 0` is true, so the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
