The function `func_2` takes a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5). It modifies the list such that all elements from index 0 to index n-2 are set to 0, while the last element (index n-1) remains unchanged if it was initially greater than 0. The function then calls another function `func_1` with the modified list and `n` as arguments. If `func_1` returns `True`, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final state of the list is such that all elements except possibly the last one are 0.
