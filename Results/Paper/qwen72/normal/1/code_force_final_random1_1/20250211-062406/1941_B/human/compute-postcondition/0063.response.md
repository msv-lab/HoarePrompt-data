The code snippet `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` updates the value of `a[2]` by subtracting `2 * opNum` from it. Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- `i` is 1.
- `opNum` is `a[1]`.
- `a[1]` is less than 0.

The code modifies `a[2]` as follows:
- `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] - 2 * a[1]`.

Since `a[1]` is less than 0, `2 * a[1]` is also less than 0, which means `a[2]` will increase (because we are subtracting a negative number).

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `opNum` is `a[1]`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - a[1]`, `a[1]` is updated to `a[1] - 2 * a[1]`, `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] - 2 * a[1]`, `a[1]` is less than 0, `stop` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
