Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is equal to `a[n-3]`, `a[n-3]` has been updated to `0`, `a[n-2]` has been updated to `a[n-2] - 2 * opNum`, `a[n-1]` has been updated to `a[n-1] - opNum`, and `stop` is set to True because at least one element in `a` became less than 0 during the loop execution. The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of its body and move to the next iteration.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of its body and move to the next iteration immediately. This means that no further changes are made to the variables within the current iteration. Therefore, the values of `t`, `numTest`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `opNum`, and `stop` remain unchanged. The only effect is that the loop will proceed to the next iteration without executing any subsequent statements in the current iteration.
