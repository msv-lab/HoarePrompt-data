Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 4, `opNum` is `a[1]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - a[1]`, `a[1]` is `a[1] - 2 * a[1]` (and is less than 0), `a[2]` is `a[2] - 2 * a[1]`, `a[3]` is `a[3] - a[1]`, and `stop` is True. If `a[2]` is less than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
