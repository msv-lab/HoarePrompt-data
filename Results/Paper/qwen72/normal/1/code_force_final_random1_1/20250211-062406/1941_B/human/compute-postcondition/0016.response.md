Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string, and the loop will continue to execute as long as the current value of `_` is less than the value of `t`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `_` remains incremented by 1.
- The value of `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The value of `a` remains an input integer.
- The variable `b` is now a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string.
- The condition for the loop (current value of `_` being less than `t`) remains unchanged.
