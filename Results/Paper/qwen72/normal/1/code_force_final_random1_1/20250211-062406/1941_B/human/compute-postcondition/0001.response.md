Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `a` is an input integer.** 

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of the user's input, which is converted to an integer using `int(input())`. The initial state variables `_` and `t` remain unchanged. The input must be a positive integer within the specified range for the loop to execute, but this condition does not affect the current state of the variables.
