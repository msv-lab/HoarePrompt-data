Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is equal to `a[n-3]`, `a[n-3]` has been updated to `0`, `a[n-2]` has been updated to `a[n-2] - 2 * opNum`, `a[n-1]` has been updated to `a[n-1] - opNum`, `stop` is False, and either the last element of `a` (`a[len(a) - 1]`) is not 0 or the second-to-last element of `a` (`a[len(a) - 2]`) is not 0, or both `a[len(a) - 1]` and `a[len(a) - 2]` are 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 2):
    if a[i] < 0:
        print('NO')
        stop = True
        break
    opNum = a[i]
    a[i] -= opNum
    a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
    a[i + 2] -= opNum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `opNum` is `a[0]`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - opNum`, `a[1]` is updated to `a[1] - 2 * opNum`, `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] - opNum`. If `a[0]` was less than 0, `stop` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `opNum` is `a[1]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - a[1]`, `a[1]` is `a[1] - 2 * a[1]` (and is less than 0), `a[2]` is `a[2] - 2 * a[1]`, `a[3]` is `a[3] - a[1]`, `stop` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 4, `opNum` is `a[2]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - a[1]`, `a[1]` is `a[1] - 2 * a[1]` (and is less than 0), `a[2]` is `a[2] - 2 * a[1] - opNum` (and is less than 0), `a[3]` is `a[3] - a[1] - 2 * opNum - opNum`, and `stop` is True. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
