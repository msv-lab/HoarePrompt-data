Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the execution.
- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting an input string.
- The conditions for the list `b` are:
  - The first element of `b` is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or
  - The last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2.

Given these conditions, the `print('NO')` statement will always execute because the conditions described ensure that the list `b` does not meet a specific pattern. Therefore, the output will always be 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
