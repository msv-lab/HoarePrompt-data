Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 4.
- `opNum` is `a[1]`.
- `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - a[1]`.
- `a[1]` is updated to `a[1] - 2 * a[1]`, which results in `a[1]` being less than 0.
- `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] - 2 * a[1]`.
- `a[3]` is updated to `a[3] - a[1]`.
- `stop` is set to `True`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given this state, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
