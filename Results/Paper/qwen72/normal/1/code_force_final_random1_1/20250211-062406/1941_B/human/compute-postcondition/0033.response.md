Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is equal to `a[n-3]`, `a[n-3]` is updated to `a[n-3] - a[n-3]`, `a[n-2]` is updated to `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[n-1]` is updated to `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`, `stop` is set to True if any element in `a` becomes less than 0 during the loop execution, otherwise `stop` remains False.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains within its original bounds (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- The variable `numTest` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `n` remains within its original bounds (3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
- The list `a` remains a list of `n` integers, but its elements may have been modified by the loop.
- The loop index `i` reaches `n - 3` after the final iteration.
- The value of `opNum` is the last value of `a[i]` before the loop ends, which is `a[n-3]`.
- The elements `a[n-3]`, `a[n-2]`, and `a[n-1]` are updated as follows:
  - `a[n-3]` is set to 0 (since `a[n-3] - a[n-3]` equals 0).
  - `a[n-2]` is reduced by `2 * a[n-3]`.
  - `a[n-1]` is reduced by `a[n-3]`.
- The variable `stop` is set to True if any element in `a` becomes less than 0 during the loop execution; otherwise, it remains False.
