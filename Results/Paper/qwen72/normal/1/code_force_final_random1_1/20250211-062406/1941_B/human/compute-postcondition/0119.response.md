Postcondition: ***`numTest` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input with the first `n-2` elements now equal to 0, `a[n-1]` and `a[n]` are unchanged, `i` is `n-3`, `opNum` is 0. If `stop` is True, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
