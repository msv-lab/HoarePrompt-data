Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is a new integer input by the user that must be greater than 3.
- `a` is a new string input by the user.
- `b` is a new string input by the user.
- `i` is 3.

The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('No')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **No**
