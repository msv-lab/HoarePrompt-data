You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an even integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The grid consists of two rows, and each row is represented by a string of length n containing only the characters '<' and '>', indicating the direction of the arrows in each cell. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is the last integer input by the user, `a` is the last string input by the user, `b` is the last string input by the user, and `i` is the last odd number less than `n`. The loop has completed all iterations for all `t` test cases. For each test case, if the loop did not break due to the condition `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program will print 'yes'. If the loop broke due to the condition being met, the program printed 'No' and moved on to the next test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the condition used to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Specifically, the condition checks if the robot encounters two consecutive '<' arrows in certain positions, but this does not fully capture all the scenarios where the robot might get stuck or fail to reach the target cell.

A counterexample to demonstrate the issue:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4
  >><<
  >>><
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  No
  ```

In this case, the robot can indeed reach the cell (2, 4) by following the path:
1. Start at (1, 1)
2. Move right to (1, 2)
3. Follow the arrow to (1, 3)
4. Move down to (2, 3)
5. Follow the arrow to (2, 4)

However, the program incorrectly prints "No" because it fails to consider all possible paths the robot can take. The condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is too restrictive and does not cover all valid scenarios.
