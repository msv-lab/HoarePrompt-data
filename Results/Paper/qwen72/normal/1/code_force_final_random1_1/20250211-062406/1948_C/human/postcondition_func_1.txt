The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads two rows of arrows (represented as strings of '<' and '>'), and then calls another function `func_1` with these inputs. The results of these calls are collected into a list and printed, one result per line. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly. The final state of the program is that the results of processing each test case are displayed on the standard output.
