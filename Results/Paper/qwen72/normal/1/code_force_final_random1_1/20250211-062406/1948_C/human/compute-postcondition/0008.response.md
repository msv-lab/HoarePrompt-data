Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `i` is 1, and either (i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
