Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is a new integer input by the user that must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a new string input by the user.
- `b` is a new string input by the user.
- `i` is 1.
- Additionally, either (i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<').

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'No'`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It directly prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **No**
