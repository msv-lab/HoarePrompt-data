Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of columns in a 2-row grid, and two strings of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>', representing the directions of arrows in each cell of the grid. The function returns a list of results for each test case, where each result indicates whether it's possible to move from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid following the arrow directions.**
