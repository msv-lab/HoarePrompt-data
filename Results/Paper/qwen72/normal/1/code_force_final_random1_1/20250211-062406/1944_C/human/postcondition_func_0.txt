The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input and processes it using a `Counter` object `nums` to track the frequency of each integer. It iterates through the list, decrementing the frequency of certain integers based on the current value of `start` and its successor. The function updates a set `vis` to keep track of the indices that have been processed. The function does not return any value but prints the value of `start` when it can no longer find a valid successor in `nums` with a non-zero frequency. After the function concludes, `nums` will have updated frequencies, `vis` will contain the indices processed, and `start` will be the last index that was successfully processed. In specific cases, the function may print `start + 1` if it encounters a situation where `start + 1` has a zero frequency.
