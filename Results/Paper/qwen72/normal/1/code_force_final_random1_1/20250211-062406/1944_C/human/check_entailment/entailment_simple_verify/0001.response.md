### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` (which she builds), while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the final score of the game.
   - It uses a counter (`nums`) to keep track of the frequency of each element in the array `arr`.
   - The variable `start` is initialized to 0, representing the current candidate for the MEX.
   - A set `vis` is used to keep track of the elements that have been visited (or picked).

3. **Step-by-Step Execution**:
   - The loop continues until the current candidate `start` is no longer present in the array `arr`.
   - In each iteration, the current candidate `start` is added to the set `vis`, and its count in the counter `nums` is decremented.
   - If the next candidate (`start + 1`) is present in the array, it is also decremented, and `start` is incremented.
   - If the next candidate (`start + 1`) is not present, the function prints `start + 1` and returns, as this is the MEX of the array `c`.

4. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning they always make the best move to achieve their respective goals.
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest available element to maximize the MEX, while Bob will try to pick the next smallest available element to minimize the MEX.
   - The algorithm correctly simulates this optimal play by ensuring that the smallest available elements are picked first.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm handles edge cases where the array might be empty or contain only one element.
   - The use of the counter and set ensures that the algorithm efficiently tracks the elements and their frequencies.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the array `arr`.
   - The space complexity is O(n) due to the use of the counter and set.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:
- The annotated code provides a clear understanding of the state of the program at key points.
- The loop continues to execute until it can no longer find a valid `start + 1` in `nums` with a non-zero frequency.
- The final value of `start` will be the last index that was successfully processed, and the program will print `start + 1` and terminate.
- This aligns with the expected behavior of the algorithm, where the MEX is determined by the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array `c`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the final score of the game based on the optimal play of Alice and Bob. The reasoning and steps are sound, and the algorithm efficiently handles the problem constraints.

Final: **True**
