To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `arr` is a list of integers where \(0 \leq \text{arr}[i] < \text{len}(\text{arr})\).
- The length of `arr` (n) satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `nums` is a `Counter` object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
- The frequency of the integer 0 in `nums` is decreased by 1.
- The frequency of the integer 1 in `nums` is now the original frequency minus 2.
- If `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is true (i.e., the frequency of `start + 1` is greater than 0), then:
  - The frequency of the integer 2 in `nums` is now the original frequency minus 1.
  - `start` is 2.
  - `vis` is a set containing the elements 0 and 1.
- If `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is false, the program does not return any value.

### Loop Head:
```python
while nums.get(start, 0):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `nums.get(start, 0)`, which means the loop will continue as long as the frequency of the integer `start` in `nums` is greater than 0.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `start` is 2.
- Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `nums.get(2, 0)` must be greater than 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is the frequency of the integer 2 in `nums`.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure the loop executes one more time, the frequency of the integer 2 in `nums` must be greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` (n) satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`. The frequency of the integer 0 in `nums` is decreased by 1, the frequency of the integer 1 in `nums` is now the original frequency minus 2, the frequency of the integer 2 in `nums` is now the original frequency minus 1, `start` is 2, and `vis` is a set containing the elements 0 and 1. The frequency of the integer 2 in `nums` must be greater than 0.**
