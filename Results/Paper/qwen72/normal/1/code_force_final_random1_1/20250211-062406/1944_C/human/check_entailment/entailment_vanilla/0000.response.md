### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob play a game where they alternately pick elements from an array `a` until it is empty.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the final score of the game.
   - It uses a counter `nums` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.
   - It initializes `start` to 0 and iterates through the elements, simulating the game's turns.

3. **Step-by-Step Breakdown**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `nums = c.Counter(arr)` creates a counter dictionary to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
     - `start = 0` initializes the starting point for the MEX calculation.
     - `vis = set()` is used to keep track of visited elements, though it is not used in the current implementation.

   - **Game Simulation**:
     - The while loop continues as long as the current `start` value exists in `nums`.
     - `vis.add(start)` adds the current `start` value to the set of visited elements (though this is not used).
     - `nums[start] -= 1` decrements the count of the current `start` value.
     - If the next value (`start + 1`) exists in `nums`, it is also decremented, and `start` is incremented.
     - If the next value does not exist, the function prints `start + 1` and returns.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The algorithm correctly simulates the game by alternating between Alice and Bob's moves.
   - It ensures that the MEX is calculated correctly by checking the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array `c`.
   - The logic for decrementing the counts and moving to the next value is consistent with the game rules.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm handles edge cases such as arrays with repeated elements and arrays with small values.
   - It correctly handles the case where the array is empty or contains only one element.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the game logic and calculates the MEX of the array `c` as required by the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
