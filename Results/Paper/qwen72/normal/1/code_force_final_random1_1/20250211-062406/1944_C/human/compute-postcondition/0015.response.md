The value of `nums[start + 1]` is decremented by 1. Given that `start` is 1, `start + 1` equals 2. Therefore, the frequency of the integer 2 in `nums` is decreased by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` (n) satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and the frequency of the integer 0 in `nums` is decreased by 1. The frequency of the integer 1 in `nums` is now the original frequency minus 2. The frequency of the integer 2 in `nums` is now the original frequency minus 1. `arr` must contain at least one occurrence of the integer 0. `start` is 1. `vis` is a set containing the elements 0 and 1. `nums.get(1, 0)` must be greater than 0.**
