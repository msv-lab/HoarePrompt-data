Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually, reading the size of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Counter Initialization**: It uses `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.
   - **Game Simulation**:
     - It initializes `start` to 0, which represents the current MEX value being considered.
     - It uses a set `vis` to keep track of elements that have been added to the array `c`.
     - It enters a loop where it checks if the current `start` value exists in the counter `nums`. If it does, it adds `start` to `vis` and decrements its count in `nums`.
     - If the next value (`start + 1`) also exists in `nums`, it decrements its count and increments `start`.
     - If `start + 1` does not exist in `nums`, it prints `start + 1` and returns, as this is the MEX of the array `c`.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - The logic ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice always tries to maximize the MEX by choosing the smallest available number, and Bob tries to minimize it by removing the next smallest number if possible.
   - The loop continues until no more numbers can be added to `c` that would change the MEX, at which point the MEX is printed.

The program handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, ensuring that the MEX is calculated correctly for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
