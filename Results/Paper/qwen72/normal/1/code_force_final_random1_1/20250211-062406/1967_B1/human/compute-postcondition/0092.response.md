Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than or equal to 5, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is `n + sum(int((int(n / k) - (k - 1)) / k) + 1 for k in range(2, m + 1))`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs from `count = 2` to `count = m`.
- For each iteration, `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
- `g` is calculated as `int(n / count) - (count - 1)`.
- If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
- Otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to it.
- After the loop completes, `count` will be `m + 1`.
- The final value of `ans` is the initial value of `n` plus the sum of `int((int(n / k) - (k - 1)) / k) + 1` for each `k` from 2 to `m`.
- `countmins` will be `m - 1` after the last iteration.
- `g` will be `int(n / m) - (m - 1)` after the last iteration.
