Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than or equal to 5, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `count` is 5, `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1 + int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 1 + int((int(n / 4) - 3) / 4) + 1`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `int(n / 4) - 3`.** 

The value of `count` has been incremented by 1, changing from 4 to 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
