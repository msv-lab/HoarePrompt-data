Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `countmins` to `int(count - 1)`.
- Since `count` is 2, `countmins` becomes `int(2 - 1)`, which is 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, and `g`) remain unchanged.
