Output State: **`n` and `m` are the input integers, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2)`**.

Explanation: The variable `g` is assigned the value of `int(n / count)`. Since `count` is 2, `g` becomes `int(n / 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
