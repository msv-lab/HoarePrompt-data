Postcondition: ***`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
