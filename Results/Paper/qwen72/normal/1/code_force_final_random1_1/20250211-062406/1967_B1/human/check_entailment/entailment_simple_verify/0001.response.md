### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For \(b = 1\), \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\). Therefore, all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid, contributing \(n\) valid pairs.
   - For \(b > 1\), we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program initializes `ans` with `n`, which correctly accounts for all pairs \((a, 1)\).
   - It then iterates over possible values of \(b\) starting from 2 up to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values using the following steps:
     - `countmins = count - 1`
     - `g = n // count`
     - If `g < countmins`, it breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it updates `ans` with `g // count + 1`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The initialization of `ans` with `n` is correct.
   - The loop iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(m\), which is correct.
   - The condition `if g < countmins` is used to break the loop early if no more valid pairs can be found, which is a reasonable optimization.
   - The update `ans += g // count + 1` is intended to count valid pairs, but this formula is not clearly derived from the problem statement. Specifically, it does not directly ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The formula `g // count + 1` is not derived from the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This could lead to incorrect counts of valid pairs.
   - The logic for counting valid pairs when \(b > 1\) is not clearly explained and may not be correct.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The specific formula used for counting valid pairs when \(b > 1\) is not derived from the problem statement and may lead to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
