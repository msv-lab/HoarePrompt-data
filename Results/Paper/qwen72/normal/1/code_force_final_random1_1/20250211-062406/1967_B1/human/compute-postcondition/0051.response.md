Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1 + int((int(n / 4) - 3) / 4) + 1`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `int(n / 4) - 3`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to its current value.
- The current value of `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1`.
- The value of `g` is `int(n / 4) - 3`.
- The new value of `ans` becomes `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1 + int((int(n / 4) - 3) / 4) + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `countmins`, `g`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that if `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, remains valid.
