Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than or equal to 5, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to its current value.
- `g` is calculated as `int(n / 2) - 1`.
- `int(g / count)` is computed as `int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2)`.
- The new value of `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `countmins`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement (`g < countmins`) is still checked and remains valid.
