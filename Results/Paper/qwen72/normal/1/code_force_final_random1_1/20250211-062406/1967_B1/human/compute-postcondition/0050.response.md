The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`. Given that `g` is initially `int(n / 4)` and `countmins` is 3, the new value of `g` is `int(n / 4) - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. If the new value of `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `int(n / 4) - 3`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
