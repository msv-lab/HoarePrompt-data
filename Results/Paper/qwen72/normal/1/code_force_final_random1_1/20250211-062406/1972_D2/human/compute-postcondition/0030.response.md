The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The greatest common divisor condition between `x` and `y` (which was 1) remains true after the increment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 15, `m` must be at least 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 3, `cnt` is 2.25, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is still 1.
