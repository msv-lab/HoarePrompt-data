Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `func_1()` has been called `t` times.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged (as it is only used to control the number of iterations), and the function `func_1()` has been called exactly `t` times.
