The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The conditions for updating `cnt` are not met because the code snippet only increments `y` and does not evaluate the condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`. Therefore, `cnt` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 6, `x` remains unchanged, `y` is incremented by 1, and `cnt` remains unchanged.**
