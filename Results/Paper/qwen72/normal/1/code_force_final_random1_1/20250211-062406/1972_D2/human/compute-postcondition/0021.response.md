Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the user, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated from its previous value (which was the smallest integer such that `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`) to 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
