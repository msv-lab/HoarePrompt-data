Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the user, `x` is 2, `y` is the smallest integer such that `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `n`, `m`, `y`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. The conditions and definitions for `y` and `cnt` remain the same, but they now apply to the new value of `x` which is 2.
