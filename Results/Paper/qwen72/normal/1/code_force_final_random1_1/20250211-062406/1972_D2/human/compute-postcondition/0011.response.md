To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

### Initial State:
- `n` is at least 3.
- `m` is at least 6.
- `cnt` is a variable whose initial value is not specified, but it is assumed to be defined.
- `x` and `y` are variables whose values are not specified, but they are assumed to be defined and non-zero to avoid division by zero errors.

### Code Snippet:
```python
cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Expression Evaluation**:
   - `n / ((x + y) * x)`: This computes the division of `n` by the product of `(x + y)` and `x`.
   - `m // ((x + y) * y)`: This computes the integer division of `m` by the product of `(x + y)` and `y`.

2. **Min Function**:
   - The `min` function returns the smaller of the two computed values.

3. **Update `cnt`**:
   - The value of `cnt` is incremented by the result of the `min` function.

### Output State Calculation:
- The value of `cnt` is updated to `cnt + min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 6, `cnt` is updated to `cnt + min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`, `x` and `y` remain unchanged.**
