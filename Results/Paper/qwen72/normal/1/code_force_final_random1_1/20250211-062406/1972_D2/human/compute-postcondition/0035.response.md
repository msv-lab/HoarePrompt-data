Output State: **After all iterations, `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the user, `x` is 3, `y` is the smallest integer such that `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.**

### Explanation:
- **`x`**: Remains 3 throughout the loop because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`y`**: Increments by 1 in each iteration until the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` is no longer satisfied. The final value of `y` will be the smallest integer such that either `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`.
- **`cnt`**: Accumulates the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

This means that after the loop finishes, `y` will be the smallest integer that causes the loop condition to fail, and `cnt` will contain the total sum of the specified minimum values for all valid pairs `(x, y)`.
