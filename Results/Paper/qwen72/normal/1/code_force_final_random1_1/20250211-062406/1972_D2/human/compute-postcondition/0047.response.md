The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged. The GCD condition does not affect the outcome since the code snippet only increments `y`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 20, `m` must be at least 5, `x` is 4, `y` is 3, and `cnt` remains unchanged.**
