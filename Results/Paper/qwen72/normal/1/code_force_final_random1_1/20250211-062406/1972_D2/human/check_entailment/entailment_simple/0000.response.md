### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`, which is responsible for processing the values of `n` and `m`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1()` reads the values of `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of `x` and `y`:
     - The outer loop runs while `x * x <= n`.
     - The inner loop runs while `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
     - Inside the inner loop, it checks if `gcd(x, y) == 1` and increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` if the condition is met.
   - After the loops, it prints the value of `cnt`.

3. **Conditions and Logic:**
   - The condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` is not directly checked in the code. Instead, the code uses a different approach to count valid pairs.
   - The logic of counting pairs where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and then using the formula `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is a valid approach to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that `n` and `m` are within the specified limits.
   - The program also handles multiple test cases efficiently by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

5. **Output:**
   - The output is the count of valid pairs for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The use of the `gcd` function and the counting mechanism are appropriate for the given conditions.
