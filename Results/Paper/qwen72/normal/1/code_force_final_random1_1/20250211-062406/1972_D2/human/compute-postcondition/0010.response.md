To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The variables in the loop condition are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the user and both must be at least 2.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `y` is 2.
   - `cnt` is set to the minimum of `n / 2` and `m // 2` if the GCD of `x` and `y` was 1 before the increment.

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
   - Substituting the current values:
     - `(1 + 2) * 1 <= n` simplifies to `3 <= n`.
     - `(1 + 2) * 2 <= m` simplifies to `6 <= m`.

4. **Determine Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 3 and `m` must be at least 6.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `n` and `m` are provided by the user and must be at least 2, we need to ensure they meet the conditions for the loop to continue.
   - The current state already satisfies `n` being at least 2, but we need to ensure `n` is at least 3.
   - Similarly, the current state already satisfies `m` being at least 2, but we need to ensure `m` is at least 6.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the user and both must be at least 2, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cnt` is set to the minimum of `n / 2` and `m // 2` if the GCD of `x` and `y` was 1 before the increment, and `n` must be at least 3 and `m` must be at least 6.**
