The value of `y` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `y` is 1, the new value of `y` is 2. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` was true before the increment (since `gcd(4, 1) == 1`), and it remains true after the increment (since `gcd(4, 2) != 1`). Therefore, `cnt` does not change.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 20, `m` must be at least 5, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `cnt` remains unchanged.**
