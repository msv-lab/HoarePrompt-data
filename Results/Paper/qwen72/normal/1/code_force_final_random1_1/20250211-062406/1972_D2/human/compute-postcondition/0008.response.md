The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the given constraint that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, it implies that the function might internally use or generate a value for `t` within this range. Since the output description is missing, I cannot provide a specific return value. However, generally, such a function might return a value or perform an action based on the value of `t`.

Given the lack of specific output details, I will describe the functionality based on the typical behavior of functions with similar constraints:

Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters but operates with an internal positive integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 10^4. The exact return value or action performed by the function is not specified, but it likely depends on the value of `t`.**
