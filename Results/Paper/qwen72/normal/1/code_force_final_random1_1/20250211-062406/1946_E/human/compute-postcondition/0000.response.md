The code assigns the results of the function `func_1` called with arguments `b` and `1000000007` to the variables `c` and `d`. Since the specifics of `func_1` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we know that `c` and `d` will be assigned the values returned by `func_1`.

Output State: **a is an integer, b is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, c and d are the values returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`**.
