Functionality: ** The function `func_2` takes two parameters: an integer `a` and a list of integers `b` (with a length of at least 1). It returns the result of `(c * a) % 1000000007`, where `c` is the first value returned by the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)`. After the function concludes, the original values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the function has no side effects on any other variables or the program state. **
