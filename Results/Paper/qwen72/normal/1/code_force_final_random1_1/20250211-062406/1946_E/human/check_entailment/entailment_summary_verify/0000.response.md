### Reasoning

The original assessment is correct in stating that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly address the problem of counting the number of permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of permutations of length \( n \) that match the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - This involves combinatorial logic to determine how many valid permutations can be formed.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**: This function appears to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. It is typically used in modular arithmetic and cryptography.
   - **`func_2`**: This function uses the result of `func_1` to perform a modular multiplication. Specifically, it calculates \((c \cdot a) \mod 1000000007\), where \( c \) is derived from `func_1`.

3. **Relevance to the Problem**:
   - The problem does not require any operations related to GCD or modular arithmetic. Instead, it requires a combinatorial approach to count permutations.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not designed to solve the permutation counting problem. They are more suited for problems involving modular arithmetic and number theory.

4. **Specific Example**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     4 2 3
     1 2
     2 3 4
     ```
     The expected output is `3`, corresponding to the permutations `[1, 4, 3, 2]`, `[2, 4, 3, 1]`, and `[3, 4, 2, 1]`.
   - The provided functions do not handle this input correctly and will not produce the correct output.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The provided functions do not solve the problem as described, and they will not produce the correct output for the given test cases.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
