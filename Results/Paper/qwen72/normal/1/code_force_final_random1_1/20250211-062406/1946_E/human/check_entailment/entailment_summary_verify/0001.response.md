### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to determine the number of permutations of length `n` that match the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums, with the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. Specifically, it returns a tuple `(x, y)` such that \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\).
   - **func_2(a, b)**: This function computes the modular inverse of `b` under modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and then multiplies it by `a`. The modular inverse is used to perform division in modular arithmetic, which is often needed in combinatorial problems.

3. **Algorithm for Permutations**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to count the number of valid permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The key observation is that the prefix and suffix maximums must align with the structure of the permutation. For example, if `p_i` is a prefix maximum, it must be greater than all elements before it, and if `s_i` is a suffix maximum, it must be greater than all elements after it.
   - The number of valid permutations can be computed using combinatorial methods, such as dynamic programming or combinatorial counting techniques.

4. **Function Mismatch**:
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not directly related to counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. They are more suited for modular arithmetic operations, which might be part of a larger solution but are not sufficient on their own.
   - The problem requires a more complex algorithm to count the permutations, which is not implemented in the given functions.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as described. They are not designed to count the number of valid permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
