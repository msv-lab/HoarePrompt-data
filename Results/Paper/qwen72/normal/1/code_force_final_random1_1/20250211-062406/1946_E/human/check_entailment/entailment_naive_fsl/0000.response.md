Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly address the problem described. The problem requires counting the number of permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. However, the functions provided seem to be related to modular arithmetic and the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which are not directly relevant to solving the permutation counting problem.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  1
  4 2 3
  1 2
  2 3 4
  ```
  The expected output is `3`, corresponding to the permutations `[1, 4, 3, 2]`, `[2, 4, 3, 1]`, and `[3, 4, 2, 1]`. However, the provided functions do not handle this input and will not produce the correct output.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
