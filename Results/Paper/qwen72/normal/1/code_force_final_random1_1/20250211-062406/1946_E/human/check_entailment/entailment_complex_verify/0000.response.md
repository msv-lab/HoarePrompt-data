Reasoning:
The original assessment states that the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly address the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. However, upon closer inspection, these functions are indeed part of a solution that addresses the problem correctly.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Precomputation of Factorials:**
   ```python
   facts = [1]
   ch = 1
   for i in range(1, 200002):
       ch *= i
       ch %= 1000000007
       facts.append(ch)
   ```
   This block precomputes factorials up to \(200001\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is necessary for efficiently computing combinations later in the program.

2. **Reading Input and Initial Checks:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       (n, m1, m2) = map(int, input().split())
       p = list(map(int, input().split()))
       s = list(map(int, input().split()))
       if p[-1] != s[0] or p[0] != 1 or s[-1] != n:
           print(0)
       else:
           ...
   ```
   This block reads the input and performs initial checks to ensure that the last prefix maximum is the same as the first suffix maximum, the first prefix maximum is 1, and the last suffix maximum is \(n\). If any of these conditions fail, the program prints 0, indicating no valid permutations.

3. **Calculating the Number of Valid Permutations:**
   ```python
   ans = 1
   kol = n
   for x in s:
       cnk = func_2(facts[kol - 1], facts[n - x] * facts[kol - 1 + x - n])
       ans *= cnk
       ans %= 1000000007
       kol = n - x
   kol = s[0] - 1
   p2 = []
   for i in range(m1 - 2, -1, -1):
       p2.append(p[i])
   for x in p2:
       cnk = func_2(facts[kol - 1], facts[x - 1] * facts[kol - x])
       ans *= cnk
       ans %= 1000000007
       kol = x - 1
   for i in range(m1 - 1):
       ans *= facts[p[i + 1] - p[i] - 1]
       ans %= 1000000007
   for i in range(m2 - 1):
       ans *= facts[s[i + 1] - s[i] - 1]
       ans %= 1000000007
   print(ans)
   ```
   This block calculates the number of valid permutations using the precomputed factorials and the functions `func_1` and `func_2`. The key steps are:
   - Using `func_2` to compute combinations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - Multiplying the results of these combinations to get the total number of valid permutations.
   - Handling both prefix and suffix maximums to ensure all constraints are met.

### Functions `func_1` and `func_2`

- **`func_1(a, b)`**:
  This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. It is used to compute the modular inverse, which is essential for calculating combinations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

- **`func_2(a, b)`**:
  This function uses `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `b` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and then multiplies it by `a` to get the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is used to compute combinations efficiently.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. The use of precomputed factorials and modular arithmetic ensures that the solution is efficient and handles large inputs within the constraints.

Given the detailed analysis and the correct implementation of the required logic, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **True**
