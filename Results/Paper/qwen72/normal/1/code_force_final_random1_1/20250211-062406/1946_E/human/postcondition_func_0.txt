The function `func_1` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, where `b` is non-negative. It returns a tuple based on the following conditions: If `b` is 0, it returns (1, 0). If `a` is less than `b`, it returns a tuple with the second and first elements swapped from the result of `func_1(b, a)`. If `a` is divisible by `b` with no remainder, it returns (1, -((a // b) - 1)). Otherwise, it returns a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)`, where `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`.
