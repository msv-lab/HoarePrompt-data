The code snippet `lst[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list located at the key `a` in the dictionary `lst`. Since `lst` was not mentioned in the initial state, it's assumed that `lst` is a different dictionary from `rev`, and its initial state is not specified. However, based on the operation, we can infer that `lst` is a dictionary where each key maps to a list.

Given the initial state:
- `rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists.
- `x` is greater than 1.
- `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`).
- `a` is the first integer from the input.
- `b` is the second integer from the input.

After executing the code:
- The list at the key `a` in the dictionary `lst` now includes the value `b`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists, `x` is greater than 1, `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`), `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `lst[a]` is a list that includes `b`.**
