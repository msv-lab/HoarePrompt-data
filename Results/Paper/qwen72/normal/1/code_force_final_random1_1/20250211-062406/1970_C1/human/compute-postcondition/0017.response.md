Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists where each key `b` has a list containing all the corresponding `a` values that were read during the loop, and each key `a` has a list containing all the corresponding `b` values that were read during the loop. The variable `x` is equal to the first integer from the input (which is `n`), and `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`). The loop has executed `x - 1` times, so the lists in `rev` will contain `x - 1` elements each, corresponding to the pairs `(a, b)` read from the input. `z` is an input integer.**
