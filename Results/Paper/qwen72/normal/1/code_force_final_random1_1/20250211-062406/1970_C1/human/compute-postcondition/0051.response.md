Postcondition: ***`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `queue` is a deque that contains tuples of the form `(node, distance)` and is now one element shorter. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` has a new element `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, and `visited` now includes `neighbor`. `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been processed, including `start` and all its reachable neighbors. `current` is the node from the tuple that was removed from the front of the queue, `dist` is the distance from the `start` node to the `current` node, `tree[current]` must have at least one neighbor, and `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor of `current` in `tree[current]`.***
