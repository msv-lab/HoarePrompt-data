The code snippet `tmp = lst[tmp].pop()` removes the last element from the list `lst[tmp]` and assigns this value to `tmp`.

Given the initial state:
- `rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists where each key `b` has a list containing all the corresponding `a` values that were read during the loop, and each key `a` has a list containing all the corresponding `b` values that were read during the loop.
- `x` is equal to the first integer from the input (which is `n`).
- `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`).
- `z` is an input integer.
- `one` is `True`.
- `lst[z]` has one less element.
- `tmp` is the last element removed from `lst[z]`.
- `lst[tmp]` must not be an empty list.

After executing the code snippet:
- `tmp` is now the last element removed from `lst[tmp]`.
- `lst[tmp]` has one less element.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists where each key `b` has a list containing all the corresponding `a` values that were read during the loop, and each key `a` has a list containing all the corresponding `b` values that were read during the loop.
- `x` is equal to the first integer from the input (which is `n`).
- `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`).
- `z` is an input integer.
- `one` is `True`.
- `lst[z]` has one less element.
- `tmp` is the last element removed from `lst[z]`.
- `lst[tmp]` has one less element.
- `tmp` is the last element removed from `lst[tmp]`.

Output State: **`rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists where each key `b` has a list containing all the corresponding `a` values that were read during the loop, and each key `a` has a list containing all the corresponding `b` values that were read during the loop; `x` is equal to the first integer from the input (which is `n`); `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`); `z` is an input integer; `one` is `True`; `lst[z]` has one less element; `tmp` is the last element removed from `lst[z]`; `lst[tmp]` has one less element; `tmp` is the last element removed from `lst[tmp]`.**
