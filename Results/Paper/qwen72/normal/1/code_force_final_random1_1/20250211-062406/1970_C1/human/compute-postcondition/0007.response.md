The code `rev[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list associated with the key `b` in the `defaultdict` `rev`.

- Initially, `rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists where the list at key `a` includes `b` as its last element.
- After executing the code, the list at key `b` in `rev` will include `a` as its last element.

The other variables (`x`, `y`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists where the list at key `a` includes `b` as its last element, and the list at key `b` now includes `a` as its last element; `x` is greater than 1; `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`); `a` is the first integer from the input; `b` is the second integer from the input.**
