The code `lst[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list located at the key `a` in the dictionary `lst`. Since `rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists, and assuming `lst` is intended to be `rev` (as `lst` is not defined in the initial state), the value of `b` is appended to the list associated with the key `a` in `rev`.

Output State: **`rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists where the list at key `a` now includes `b` as its last element, `x` is greater than 1, `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`), `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input.**
