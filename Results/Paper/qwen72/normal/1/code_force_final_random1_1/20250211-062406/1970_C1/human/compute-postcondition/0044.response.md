Functionality: ** The function `func` reads from standard input a description of a tree with `n` nodes and a starting node `u_1`. It constructs two dictionaries, `lst` and `rev`, representing the adjacency lists of the tree in both directions. The function then determines the parity of the path lengths from the starting node to the leaves of the tree using two separate loops. If both paths have an even number of edges, it prints 'Hermione'; otherwise, it prints 'Ron'. The function does not return any value. **
