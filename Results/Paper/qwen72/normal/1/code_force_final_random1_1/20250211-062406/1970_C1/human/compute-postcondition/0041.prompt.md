Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rev` remains a `defaultdict` of lists where each key `b` has a list containing all the corresponding `a` values that were read during the loop, and each key `a` has a list containing all the corresponding `b` values that were read during the loop; `x` is equal to the first integer from the input (which is `n`); `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`); `z` is an input integer; `one` is `True` or `False` depending on the parity of the number of iterations; `lst[z]` and all lists accessed through `lst` during the loop have been emptied; `tmp` is now equal to `z`; `two` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
while rev[tmp] != []:
    two = not two
    tmp = rev[tmp].pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `two` is now the opposite of its previous value, `rev[z]` contains at least one element, `tmp` is the value of the last element removed from `rev[tmp]`, and `rev[tmp]` has one less element.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `two` is now the same as its value before the initial state, `rev[z]` contains at least one element, `tmp` is the value of the last element removed from `rev[tmp]`, and `rev[tmp]` now contains one less element than before.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `two` is now the opposite of its value before the initial state, `rev[z]` contains at least one element, `tmp` is the value of the last element removed from `rev[tmp]`, and `rev[tmp]` now contains at least one element, except the last element has been removed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
