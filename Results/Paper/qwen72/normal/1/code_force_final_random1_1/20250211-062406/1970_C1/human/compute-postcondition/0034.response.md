The code `tmp = rev[tmp].pop()` assigns to `tmp` the value of the last element from the list `rev[tmp]` and removes that element from the list.

Given the initial state:
- `two` is now the opposite of its previous value (this remains unchanged by the code).
- `rev[z]` contains at least one element (we assume `tmp` is a valid key in `rev` and `rev[tmp]` also contains at least one element).

After executing the code:
- `tmp` is now the value of the last element that was removed from `rev[tmp]`.
- The list `rev[tmp]` has one less element than before.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`two` is now the opposite of its previous value, `rev[z]` contains at least one element, `tmp` is the value of the last element removed from `rev[tmp]`, and `rev[tmp]` has one less element.**
