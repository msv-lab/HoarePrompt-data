Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `queue` is a deque that contains tuples of the form `(node, distance)` and is now one element shorter, `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been processed, including `start` and all its reachable neighbors, `current` is the node from the tuple that was removed from the front of the queue, and `dist` is the distance from the `start` node to the `current` node. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns the distance (`dist`) from the `start` node to the `current` node. Otherwise, the program continues processing.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `queue` is a deque that contains tuples of the form `(node, distance)` and is now one element shorter, `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been processed, including `start` and all its reachable neighbors. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. `current` is the node from the tuple that was removed from the front of the queue, `dist` is the distance from the `start` node to the `current` node, and `tree[current]` must have at least one neighbor.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `queue` is a deque that contains tuples of the form `(node, distance)` and is now one element shorter. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` has a new element `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, and `visited` now includes `neighbor`. `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been processed, including `start` and all its reachable neighbors. `current` is the node from the tuple that was removed from the front of the queue, `dist` is the distance from the `start` node to the `current` node, `tree[current]` must have at least one neighbor, and `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor of `current` in `tree[current]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree. `queue` is a deque that contains tuples of the form `(node, distance)` and is now one element shorter. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` has a new element `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `visited` now includes `neighbor`. `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been processed, including `start` and all its reachable neighbors. `current` is the node from the tuple that was removed from the front of the queue, `dist` is the distance from the `start` node to the `current` node, and `tree[current]` must have at least one more unvisited neighbor, which is the next unvisited neighbor of `current` in `tree[current]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
