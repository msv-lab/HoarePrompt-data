Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the logic of the provided program. The program indeed has a special case where `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`, and the program attempts to handle this case separately by printing `k // 2 + 1`. However, this special handling is unnecessary and potentially incorrect. The correct approach, as suggested in the original assessment, is to simply use `ceil(k / 2)` for all cases, including when `k = 4 * n - 2`.

The original assessment also provides a corrected version of the function, which simplifies the logic and removes the special case. This corrected version is indeed correct and handles all cases as required by the problem description.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw and providing a correct solution. Therefore, the original assessment should be maintained.

Final: **True**
