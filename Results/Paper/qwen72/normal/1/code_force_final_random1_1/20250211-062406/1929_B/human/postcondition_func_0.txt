The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves a square grid of size `n` and a requirement to color at least `k` diagonals. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet the requirement. If `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, it prints `k // 2 + 1`; otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
