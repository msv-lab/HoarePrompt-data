Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers derived from the second line of the input, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2, `s` is the next line in the list `[*open(0)][1:]`. If `k` is less than or equal to 4 * n - 4, the program continues with these values unchanged. If `k` is 4 * n - 3 or 4 * n - 2, the program also continues with these values unchanged.***
