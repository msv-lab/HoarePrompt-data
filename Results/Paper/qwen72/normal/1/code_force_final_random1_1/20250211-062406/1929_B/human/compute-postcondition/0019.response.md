The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2, representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell, respectively.

The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided information, but typically in such problems, the function would return a result for each test case, possibly indicating whether it is possible to color the grid according to the given conditions or providing a specific configuration that meets the criteria.

Given the lack of explicit output information, I'll assume the function returns a list of results, one for each test case, indicating whether it is possible to meet the conditions for the given `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the size of the square grid, and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, indicating whether it is possible to color the grid such that at least `k` diagonals contain at least one colored cell.**
