The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` (underscore), which is used as a placeholder indicating that the loop variable is not actually used within the loop body. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is a value greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and the loop has just completed one iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, and the loop counter (represented by `_`) should increment by 1. However, since `_` is not used and does not affect the loop's execution, the only relevant state is `t`.

Since the loop has just completed one iteration, `t` must now be decremented by 1 to reflect the remaining number of iterations. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input. If \(4 \times n - 2 = k\), then the current values of `n` and `k` satisfy the equation. Otherwise, \(4 \times n - 2\) is not equal to `k`.**
