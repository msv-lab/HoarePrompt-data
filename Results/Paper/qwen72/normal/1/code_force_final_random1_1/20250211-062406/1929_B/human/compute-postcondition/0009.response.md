The code snippet reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0, and `n` and `k` are integers provided by user input. After executing the code, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the new values provided by the user. The condition about whether \(4 \times n - 2 = k\) remains unchanged because the code does not evaluate this condition.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are the integers provided by the user input. If \(4 \times n - 2 = k\), then the current values of `n` and `k` satisfy the equation. Otherwise, \(4 \times n - 2\) is not equal to `k`.**
