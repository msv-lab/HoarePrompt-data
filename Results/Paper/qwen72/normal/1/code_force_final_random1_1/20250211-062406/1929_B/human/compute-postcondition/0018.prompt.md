Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer input by the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2, representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if 4 * n - 2 == k:
        print(k // 2 + 1)
    else:
        print(ceil(k / 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by user input. If \(4 \times n - 2 = k\), then the current values of `n` and `k` satisfy the equation. Otherwise, \(4 \times n - 2\) is not equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input. If \(4 \times n - 2 = k\), then the current values of `n` and `k` satisfy the equation. Otherwise, \(4 \times n - 2\) is not equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input. If `4 * n - 2 == k`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold, and `n` and `k` retain their original values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
