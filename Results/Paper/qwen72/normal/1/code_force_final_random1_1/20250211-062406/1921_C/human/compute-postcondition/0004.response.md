The code snippet assigns the second element of the list `feat` to the variable `f`. Given the initial state, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, and `n` is the first element of `feat`. After executing the code, `f` will hold the value of the second element of `feat`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `f` is the second element of `feat`.**
