Based on the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down the situation step by step:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `feat` is a list of integers read from input.
     - `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 0.
     - `f` is the second element of `feat`.
     - `a` is the third element of `feat`.
     - `b` is the last element of `feat`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `array2` contains the elements it had before.
   - For each pair of consecutive elements in `arr` (from index 1 to `n-1`):
     - If the difference between the current element and the previous element is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the element `(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a`.
   - The sum of `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement: `print('No')`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **No**
