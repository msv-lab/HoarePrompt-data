The code snippet appends the result of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to the list `array2`. Let's break down the impact:

- `array2` is initially an empty list. After the execution, it will contain one element, which is the result of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.
- The value of `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a` according to the precondition.
- The result of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` will be a value that is less than `b` because `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) < b / a` and multiplying both sides by `a` gives `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a < b`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

Output State: **`array2` is a list containing one element, which is the result of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` and is less than `b`; `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); `test_cases` must be greater than `n + 1`; `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `i` is not 0, and the difference between the current element `arr[i]` and the previous element `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`.**
