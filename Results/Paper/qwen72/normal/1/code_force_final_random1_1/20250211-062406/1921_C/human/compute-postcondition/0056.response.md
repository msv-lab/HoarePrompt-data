Output State: **`array2` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than `n`, `i` is `n`, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes `array2` as an empty list.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `i`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The specific conditions and relationships between these variables (e.g., `test_cases` must be greater than `n`, `n` is the first element of `feat`, etc.) remain valid.
