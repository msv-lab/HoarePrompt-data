Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four integers n, f, a, b (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9), and a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n (1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9, m_i < m_{i+1}). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    n = feat[0]
    f = feat[1]
    a = feat[2]
    b = feat[-1]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    array2 = []
    for i in range(0, n):
        if i == 0:
            if arr[0] < b / a:
                array2.append(arr[0] * a)
        elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
            array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
    if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `n-1`, and `array2` is a list containing the results of the operations performed within the loop for each valid `i` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` (or `arr[0] < b / a` for the first iteration). If the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the sum of `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` must be greater than `n`, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `n`, and `array2` contains elements where each element is the result of `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` where `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a` (if `j > 0`) or `arr[0] < b / a` (if `j == 0`). If the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of (`n - len(array2)`) and `b` is less than `f`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`array2` contains elements based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `i` is 0 and `arr[0] < b / a`, then `arr[0] * a` is appended to `array2`. For any other index `i`, if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` is appended to `array2`. The final state of `array2` will contain all such values that meet these conditions. The other variables `t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` remain unchanged. Additionally, if the sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
