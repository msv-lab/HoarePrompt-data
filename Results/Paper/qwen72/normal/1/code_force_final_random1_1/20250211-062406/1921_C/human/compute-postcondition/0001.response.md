To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `test_cases`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the `range` function and will start at 0 by default.
2. **Variable `test_cases`**: For the loop to execute at least once, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` is an input integer, each test case consists of four integers n, f, a, and b where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9.
- A list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
