The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 2, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, and `array2` is either empty or contains one element which is `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a` if the difference between the second element (`arr[1]`) and the first element (`arr[0]`) of `arr` is less than `b / a`.**
