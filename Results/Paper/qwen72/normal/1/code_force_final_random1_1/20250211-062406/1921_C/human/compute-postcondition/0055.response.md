The provided Python code snippet reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `arr`. This impacts the state of the program by updating the value of `arr` based on the new input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` must be greater than `n`
- `i` is `n`
- `feat` is a list of integers read from input
- `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 0
- `f` is the second element of `feat`
- `a` is the third element of `feat`
- `b` is the last element of `feat`
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input
- `array2` is a list containing the results of `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for all `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` where the condition `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) < b / a` is true
- If the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`

After executing the code snippet:
- `arr` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than `n`, `i` is `n`, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input, `array2` is a list containing the results of `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for all `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` where the condition `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) < b / a` is true. If the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.**
