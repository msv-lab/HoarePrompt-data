Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat`.** 

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `feat`. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `i`, and `feat`) remain unchanged.
