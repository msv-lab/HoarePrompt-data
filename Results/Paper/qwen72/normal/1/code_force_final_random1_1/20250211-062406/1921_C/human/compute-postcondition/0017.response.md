The code appends a new element to the list `array2`. This new element is calculated as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so the calculation becomes `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `array2` will now contain an additional element, which is `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 3.
- `feat` is a list of integers read from input.
- `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 3.
- `f` is the second element of `feat`.
- `a` is the third element of `feat`.
- `b` is the last element of `feat`.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `array2` now contains the elements it had before, plus the new element `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 3, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, and `array2` contains the elements it had before plus the new element `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`.**
