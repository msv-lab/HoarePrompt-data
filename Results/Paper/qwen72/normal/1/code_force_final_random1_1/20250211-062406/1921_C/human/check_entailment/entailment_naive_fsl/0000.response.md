Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the initial charge `f` is less than the cost of turning the phone on and off (`b`). This can lead to incorrect results. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
1 3 1 5
3
```

Here, the initial charge `f` is 3, and the cost of turning the phone on and off (`b`) is 5. The program will incorrectly output "Yes" because it does not check if the initial charge is sufficient to cover the cost of turning the phone on and off. However, since the initial charge is less than the cost of turning the phone on and off, it is impossible to send the message, and the correct output should be "No".
