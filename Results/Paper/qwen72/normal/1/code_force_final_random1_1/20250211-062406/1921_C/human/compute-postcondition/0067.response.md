Output State: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `array2` will contain the values `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is true. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`) will retain their original values as they were before the loop started.**
