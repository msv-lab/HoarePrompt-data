To determine what will be printed by the `print('Yes')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions described:

### Initial State:
- `array2` is constructed based on specific conditions involving the elements of `arr`, `a`, and `b`.
- For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
  - If `i` is 0 and `arr[0] < b / a`, then `arr[0] * a` is appended to `array2`.
  - For any other index `i`, if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` is appended to `array2`.
- The final state of `array2` will contain all such values that meet these conditions.
- The sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`.

### Analysis:
1. **Construction of `array2`**:
   - The elements of `array2` are determined by the conditions involving `arr`, `a`, and `b`.
   - The conditions ensure that only certain differences or values are appended to `array2`.

2. **Sum Condition**:
   - The sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` must be less than `f`.
   - This condition ensures that the total value derived from `array2` and the remaining elements (not included in `array2`) is within a certain limit.

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions, the `print('Yes')` statement will execute and print "Yes" because the conditions described in the initial state are met. The sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` being less than `f` is a key part of the precondition, ensuring that the print statement will indeed execute.

Output: **Yes**
