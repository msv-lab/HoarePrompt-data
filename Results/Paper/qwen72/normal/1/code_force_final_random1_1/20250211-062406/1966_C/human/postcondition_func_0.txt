The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, the function determines whether the game can be won by Alice under certain conditions and prints "Alice" for each test case. The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, and for each test case, it ensures that the list of stone counts is unique and sorted in descending order before performing the check. The final state of the program after processing all test cases is that `tc` is 0, indicating all test cases have been processed.
