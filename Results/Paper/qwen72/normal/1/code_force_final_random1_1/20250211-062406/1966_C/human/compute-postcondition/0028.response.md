Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `dp` is `True` if any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is `0`) is greater than 1, otherwise `dp` is `False`.
   - `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `tc` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`.

2. **Understanding `arr`:**
   - Since `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`, it looks something like this: `[a, b, c, ..., 0]` where `a > b > c > ... > 0`.

3. **Understanding `dp`:**
   - We need to check if any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is `0`) is greater than 1.
   - For example, if `arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]`, the differences are `5-4=1`, `4-3=1`, `3-2=1`, `2-1=1`, all of which are not greater than 1. Therefore, `dp` would be `False`.
   - If `arr = [5, 3, 2, 1, 0]`, the differences are `5-3=2`, `3-2=1`, `2-1=1`, and one of these differences (`5-3=2`) is greater than 1. Therefore, `dp` would be `True`.

4. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Alice' if dp else 'Alice')
   ```

5. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will always print `'Alice'` regardless of the value of `dp` because both branches of the conditional expression evaluate to `'Alice'`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The output will always be `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
