Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order followed by a 0, `dp` is True.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to be the length of `arr` minus 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `arr`, `dp`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
