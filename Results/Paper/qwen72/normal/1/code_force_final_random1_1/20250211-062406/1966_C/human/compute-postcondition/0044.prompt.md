Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tc` is an integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of piles, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
while tc > 0:
    n = int(input())
    arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True
        ) + [0]
    dp = True
    n = len(arr) - 1
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        dp = arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp
    print('Alice' if dp else 'Alice')
    tc -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `dp` will be `False` if there exists any pair of consecutive elements in `arr` such that the difference between them is 1 or less. Otherwise, `dp` will be `True`. The value of `i` will be `len(arr) - 1`, and the variables `tc`, `n`, and `arr` will remain unchanged, except `tc` is now `tc - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `dp` is `True` if any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is `0`) is greater than 1, otherwise `dp` is `False`; `i` is `len(arr) - 1`; `tc` is `tc - 1`; `n` is `len(arr) - 1`; `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `dp` is `False` if there exists any pair of consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is `0`) such that their difference is less than or equal to 1; otherwise, `dp` is `True`. `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `tc` is `tc - 2` and `tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
