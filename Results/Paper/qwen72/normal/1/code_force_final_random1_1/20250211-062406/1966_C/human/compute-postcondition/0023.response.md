To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `dp` is `True` if `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1` or `arr[1] > 1` (if `1 >= n`), otherwise `dp` is `False`.
- `i` is 1.
- `tc` is greater than 0.
- `n` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0` and must have at least 2 elements.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(arr)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(arr) - 1` (exclusive).
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `i < len(arr)`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is `len(arr) - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `i < len(arr)`.

### New State:
- After the increment, `i` will be 2.
- The condition `i < len(arr)` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`dp` is `True` if `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1` or `arr[1] > 1` (if `1 >= n`), otherwise `dp` is `False`; `i` is 2; `tc` is greater than 0; `n` is `len(arr) - 1`; `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0` and must have at least 2 elements.**
