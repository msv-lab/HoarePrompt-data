Output State: **`dp` is `False` if there exists any pair of consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is `0`) such that their difference is less than or equal to 1; otherwise, `dp` is `True`. `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `tc` is `tc - 2` and `tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `tc` is decremented by 1, so `tc` becomes `tc - 2`.
- All other variables (`dp`, `i`, `n`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
