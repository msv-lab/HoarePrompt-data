Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `arr` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order followed by a 0, `dp` is True.**

The variable `dp` is set to `True`. All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
