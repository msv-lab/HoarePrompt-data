Output State: **`dp` is `True` if any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is `0`) is greater than 1, otherwise `dp` is `False`; `i` is `len(arr) - 1`; `tc` is `tc - 1` and `tc` must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(input())`; `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`.**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`.
- All other variables (`dp`, `i`, `tc`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `n` is now the integer input provided by the user.
