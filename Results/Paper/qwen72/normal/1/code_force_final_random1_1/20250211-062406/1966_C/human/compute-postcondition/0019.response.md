Output State: **`dp` is `True`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `tc` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input in descending order, followed by a `0`.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `dp` to `True`. This overrides the initial condition that `dp` would be `False` if there exists any pair of consecutive elements in `arr` such that the difference between them is 1 or less. The other variables (`i`, `tc`, `n`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
