Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.** 

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and `tc` is an input integer also within the range 1 to 10^4. After executing the code snippet, `n` is assigned the value of an input integer, which is expected to be within the range 1 to 2·10^5. The values of `t` and `tc` remain unchanged.
