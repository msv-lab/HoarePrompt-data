The value of `n` is updated to `len(arr) - 1`. The length of `arr` is the number of elements in the list, which includes the sorted unique integers and a `0` at the end. Therefore, `n` is now the index of the last element in `arr` (which is `0`).

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `dp` is still `True`
- `i` is still `len(arr) - 1`
- `tc` is still greater than 0
- `arr` is still a sorted list of unique integers from the input in descending order, followed by a `0`.

Output State: **`dp` is `True`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `tc` is greater than 0, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input in descending order, followed by a `0`.**
