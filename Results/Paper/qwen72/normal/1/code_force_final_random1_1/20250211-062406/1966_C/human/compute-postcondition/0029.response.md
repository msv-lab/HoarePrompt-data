Output State: **`dp` is `True` if any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is `0`) is greater than 1, otherwise `dp` is `False`; `i` is `len(arr) - 1`; `tc` is `tc - 1`; `n` is `len(arr) - 1`; `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`.**

Explanation: The value of `tc` is decremented by 1, while the other variables (`dp`, `i`, `n`, and `arr`) remain unchanged. The new value of `tc` is `tc - 1`.
