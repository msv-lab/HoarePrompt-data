Output State: **`dp` is `True` if `arr[2] - (arr[3] if 2 < n else 0) > 1` or `dp` was `False`, otherwise `dp` is `False`; `i` is 2; `tc` is greater than 0; `n` is `len(arr) - 1`; `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0` and must have at least 2 elements.**

Explanation:
- The value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp`.
- Given `i` is 2, the condition checks if `arr[2] - (arr[3] if 2 < n else 0) > 1` or if `dp` was `False`.
- If `2 < n`, then `arr[3]` is used; otherwise, `0` is used.
- If the condition is true, `dp` becomes `True`; otherwise, `dp` remains `False`.
- All other variables (`i`, `tc`, `n`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
