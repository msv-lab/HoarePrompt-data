The code snippet `cnt += math.floor(x / 2)` modifies the value of `cnt` by adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to its current value. Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `p_i` remains integers such that 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least three elements.
- `x` is the third element of `a`.

The initial value of `cnt` depends on the conditions:
- If the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, then `cnt` is 1 + 2 * math.floor(x / 2).
- Otherwise, `cnt` is 2 * math.floor(x / 2).

After executing `cnt += math.floor(x / 2)`, the new value of `cnt` will be:
- If the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, then `cnt` becomes (1 + 2 * math.floor(x / 2)) + math.floor(x / 2) = 1 + 3 * math.floor(x / 2).
- Otherwise, `cnt` becomes (2 * math.floor(x / 2)) + math.floor(x / 2) = 3 * math.floor(x / 2).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least three elements, `x` is the third element of `a`, if the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, then `cnt` is 1 + 3 * math.floor(x / 2), otherwise `cnt` is 3 * math.floor(x / 2).**
