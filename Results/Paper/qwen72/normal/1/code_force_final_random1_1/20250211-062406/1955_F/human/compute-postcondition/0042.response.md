Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers read from input for each iteration, `cnt` is the sum of 1 (if the first three elements of `a` are equal and are odd numbers) plus the floor division of each element in `a` by 2 for each iteration.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The total number of test cases remains the same, as it is given initially and does not change throughout the loop.
- **`p_i`**: These are the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence, which are provided as part of the input and do not change within the loop.
- **`a`**: For each iteration of the loop, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input. This means that `a` is re-initialized for each test case.
- **`cnt`**: For each iteration, `cnt` is calculated based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically:
  - If the first three elements of `a` are equal and are odd numbers, `cnt` is incremented by 1.
  - For each element `x` in `a`, `cnt` is incremented by the floor division of `x` by 2.
- **Final State**: After all iterations, `cnt` will be the sum of the values calculated for each test case, but since `cnt` is reset for each test case, the final value of `cnt` for each test case is independent of the others. The output for each test case is printed separately.
