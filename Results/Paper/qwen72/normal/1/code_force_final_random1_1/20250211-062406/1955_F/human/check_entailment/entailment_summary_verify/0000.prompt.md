You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. For each test case, it reads four integers `p_i` (where `0 <= p_i <= 200`) and converts them to even numbers by subtracting their modulo 2 value. It then calculates and prints a value for each test case, which is the sum of the following: 1 if the first three integers are all odd (which they cannot be after conversion to even), and half the sum of the converted even integers. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the state is that `t` lines of output have been printed, each corresponding to a test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input values are all even. According to the problem statement, the goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins. The program uses a lambda function to subtract the remainder of each input value divided by 2, which effectively rounds down to the nearest even number. However, this approach fails to consider the optimal strategy for removing numbers to ensure Bob wins as many times as possible.

For example, consider the input `2 2 2 2`. In this case, the program will output `0`, but the correct output should be `4` because Bob can win every time a number is removed, as long as the total XOR remains zero. The program does not account for the fact that removing an even number of any specific type of number (1, 2, 3, or 4) will not change the overall XOR result, which is crucial for determining the optimal strategy for Bob to win.
