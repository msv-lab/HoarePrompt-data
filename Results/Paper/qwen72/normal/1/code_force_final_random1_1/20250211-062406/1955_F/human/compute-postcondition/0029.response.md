The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This changes the value of `a` from its initial state to a new list of integers.

Let's go through the impact of the code on the program:

- `a` is updated to a new list of integers based on user input.
- The values of `t`, `p_i`, `cnt`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is `cnt + sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a)`, `x` is the last element of `a` (before the update).**
