To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `_` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The variable `_` is a placeholder used in the loop and does not affect the loop's execution condition.
2. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must return a positive integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- Each of the four integers `p_i` in each test case is an integer where 0 <= p_i <= 200.

We need to ensure that the input provided to the loop is a positive integer, which aligns with the constraints of `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input is a positive integer within the valid range for `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the input to the loop must be a positive integer within the range 1 <= int(input()) <= 10^4**
