The code snippet `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `ar`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer

After executing the code snippet, the list `ar` will contain the integers provided by the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input.**
