To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration:

### Given Loop:
```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 1 element
- `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`
- `mex` is now equal to `n - ar[i]`
- `i` is `len(ar) - 1`
- `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`
- `ar[i]` is greater than 0

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `ar`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 each time.
3. **Current State**:
   - `i` is `len(ar) - 1`
   - `ar` must have at least 1 element

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- **Variable `i`**: Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, the next value of `i` will be `len(ar) - 2`.
- **List `ar`**: The list `ar` must still have at least 1 element for the loop to continue.

### Updated State:
- `t` remains the same: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` remains the same: 2
- `n` remains the same: an input integer
- `ar` must have at least 1 element
- `res` remains the same: a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`
- `mex` is now equal to `n - ar[i]` (where `i` is `len(ar) - 2`)
- `i` is `len(ar) - 2`
- `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]` (where `i` is `len(ar) - 2`)
- `ar[i]` is greater than 0 (where `i` is `len(ar) - 2`)

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`, `mex` is now equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, and `ar[len(ar) - 2]` is greater than 0**
