Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) from an array \( a \), where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The \(\texttt{MEX}\) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function initializes `mex` to `n`.
   - It iterates over the array `ar` in reverse order.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if the new value is less than the current `mex`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The algorithm correctly reconstructs the permutation \( p \) by working backwards from the last element to the first.
   - The update of `mex` ensures that the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation is correctly identified.
   - The calculation `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` aligns with the definition of \( a_i \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles multiple test cases as expected.
   - It correctly processes the input and outputs the permutation for each test case.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `1 1 -2 1 2`, the function correctly outputs `0 1 4 2 3`.
   - For the input `1 1 1 1 1`, the function correctly outputs `0 1 2 3 4`.
   - For the input `-2 1 2`, the function correctly outputs `2 0 1`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
