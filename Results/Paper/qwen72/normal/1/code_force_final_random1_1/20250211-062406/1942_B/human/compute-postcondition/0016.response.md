The code snippet updates the value of `mex` by subtracting the value of `ar[i]` from it. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one element
- `res` is a list of `None` with length `n` except for the last three elements which are `mex - ar[-1]`, `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, and `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`
- `i` is `len(ar) - 4`

After executing the code snippet `mex = mex - ar[i]`, the value of `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 4]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one element, `res` is a list of `None` with length `n` except for the last three elements which are `mex - ar[-1]`, `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, and `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 4`, `mex` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 4]`.**
