Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`, `mex` is now equal to `n - sum(ar)`, and `i` is `-1` after the loop has completed all its iterations.**

Explanation:
- The variable `res` is initialized to a list of `n` elements, all set to `None`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `ar`, `mex`, and `i`) retain their previous values or conditions as specified in the initial state.
