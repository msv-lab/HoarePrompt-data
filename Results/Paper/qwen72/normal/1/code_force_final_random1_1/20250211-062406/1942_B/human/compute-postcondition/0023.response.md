Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None`. `mex` is the result of repeatedly subtracting each element of `ar` from the initial value `n` as long as `mex > mex - ar[i]` holds true.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes the list `res` to have `n` elements, all set to `None`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `ar` remain unchanged.
- The variable `mex` is still defined as the result of the described operation, but its value has not been computed yet.
