To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the object in the loop head, which is the variable `_`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n).

The loop will execute if the input value is at least 1. Since `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is guaranteed that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the input value should be equal to `t` for the loop to execute the correct number of times.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is at least 1, which is already guaranteed by the problem constraints.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0 (initially, before the loop starts), and the input value is `t` which must be at least 1**.
