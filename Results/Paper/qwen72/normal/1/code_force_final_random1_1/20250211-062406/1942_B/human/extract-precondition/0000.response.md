Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), where n is the length of both p and a, and a is constructed based on the MEX operation on p. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
