The code snippet `mex = mex - ar[i]` updates the value of `mex` by subtracting the value of `ar[i]` from its current value.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 3 elements
- `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`
- `i` is `len(ar) - 3`
- `ar[len(ar) - 3]` is greater than 0
- `res[len(ar) - 3]` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`
- `mex` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`
- `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` which is `n - 2 * ar[len(ar) - 3]`

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. `mex` is initially `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`.
2. `i` is `len(ar) - 3`.
3. `ar[i]` is `ar[len(ar) - 3]`.
4. The new value of `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`, which is `(n - ar[len(ar) - 3]) - ar[len(ar) - 3]`.

Therefore, the new value of `mex` is `n - 2 * ar[len(ar) - 3]`.

The updated state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 3 elements
- `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`
- `i` is `len(ar) - 3`
- `ar[len(ar) - 3]` is greater than 0
- `res[len(ar) - 3]` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`
- `mex` is `n - 2 * ar[len(ar) - 3]`
- `res[i]` is `n - 2 * ar[len(ar) - 3]`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 3 elements, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `ar[len(ar) - 3]` is greater than 0, `res[len(ar) - 3]` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `mex` is `n - 2 * ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `res[i]` is `n - 2 * ar[len(ar) - 3]`.**
