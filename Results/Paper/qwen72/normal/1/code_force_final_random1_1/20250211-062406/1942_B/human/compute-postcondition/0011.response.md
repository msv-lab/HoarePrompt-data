The code snippet `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` updates the value of `res[i]` based on the current values of `mex` and `ar[i]`. Let's break down the impact:

- `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.
- `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, so `res[len(ar) - 2]` is updated.
- The value of `mex` is either `n` or `n - ar[i]` depending on the condition `mex > mex - ar[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one element.
- `res` is a list of `None` with length `n` except for the last element which is `mex - ar[-1]`.
- `mex` is either `n` or `n - ar[i]` depending on whether `mex > mex - ar[i]` held true.
- `i` is `len(ar) - 2`.

After executing the code:
- `res[i]` (which is `res[len(ar) - 2]`) is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one element, `res` is a list of `None` with length `n` except for the last element which is `mex - ar[-1]` and the second-to-last element which is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `mex` is either `n` or `n - ar[i]` depending on whether `mex > mex - ar[i]` held true, and `i` is `len(ar) - 2`.**
