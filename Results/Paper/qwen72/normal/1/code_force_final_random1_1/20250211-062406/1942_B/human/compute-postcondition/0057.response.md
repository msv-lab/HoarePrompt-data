Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 3 elements, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `ar[len(ar) - 3]` is greater than 0, `res[len(ar) - 3]` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `mex` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, and `res[i]` is `n - 2 * ar[len(ar) - 3]`. If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - 2 * ar[len(ar) - 3]`.***
