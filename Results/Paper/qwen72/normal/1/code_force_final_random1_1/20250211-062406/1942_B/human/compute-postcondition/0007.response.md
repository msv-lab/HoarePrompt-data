Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one element, `res` is a list of `None` with length `n` except for the last element which is `mex - ar[-1]`, `mex` is `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, and the condition `(mex > mex - ar[i])` holds true.** 

This means that all the initial conditions remain valid, and additionally, the value of `mex` is greater than the value of `mex - ar[i]`. Given that `mex` is `n` and `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, this implies that `n` is greater than `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, which simplifies to `ar[len(ar) - 1]` being greater than 0.
