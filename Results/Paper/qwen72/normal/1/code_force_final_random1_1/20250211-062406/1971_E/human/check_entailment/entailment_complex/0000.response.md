### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input for multiple test cases, including the values of `n`, `k`, and `q`, as well as the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes the lists `a` and `b` with an extra zero at the beginning to handle the starting point (0, 0) more easily. This is a good practice to avoid off-by-one errors.

3. **Calculating Differences**: The program calculates the differences in distances (`ad`) and times (`bd`) between consecutive points. This is necessary to determine the speed between each segment.

4. **Speed Calculation**: The program calculates the speed `v` for each segment using the formula `v[i] = ad[i] / bd[i]`. This is correct because the speed is the ratio of the distance to the time taken.

5. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment in which the query point `ql` lies. This is efficient and appropriate for the problem constraints.

6. **Time Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the time taken to reach the query point `ql` by adding the time taken to reach the start of the segment and the additional time to reach the query point within the segment. The time is rounded down using `int(m)`.

7. **Output**: The program prints the results for each query separated by spaces and ensures that each test case's results are printed on a new line.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output formats correctly, uses efficient algorithms for finding the segment and calculating the time, and produces the expected output for the given examples.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
