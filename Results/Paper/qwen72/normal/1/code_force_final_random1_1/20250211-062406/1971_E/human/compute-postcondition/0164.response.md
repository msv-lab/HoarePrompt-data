To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given Information:
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces
- `len(b)` is greater than or equal to 1
- `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`
- `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`
- `a` has at least `len(b) + (len(a) - 1)` elements
- The loop head is `for l in range(q):`

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `l` and the variable `q`.
- For the loop to execute, `q` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `l` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

### Adjustments Needed:
- We need to ensure that `q` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- The variable `l` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `len(a) - 1`, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces, `len(b)` is greater than or equal to 1, `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `a` has at least `len(b) + (len(a) - 1)` elements, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0**
