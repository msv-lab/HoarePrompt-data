Output State: **`i` is 2, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input split by spaces, `len(b)` is greater than 2, `bd` is a list that now includes the values `b[1] - b[0]` and `b[2] - b[1]`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the difference between the elements `b[2]` and `b[1]` to the list `bd`. Since `bd` already contained the value `b[1] - b[0]`, it now includes both `b[1] - b[0]` and `b[2] - b[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
