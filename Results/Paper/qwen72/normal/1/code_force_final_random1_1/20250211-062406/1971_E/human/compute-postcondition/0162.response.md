Output State: **`i` is `len(b) + 1`, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces, `len(b)` is greater than or equal to 1, `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, ad[i] / bd[i], ad[i] / bd[i], ad[i] / bd[i]]`, `a` must have at least `len(b) + 2` elements.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains `len(b) + 1`.
- The list `b` remains unchanged.
- The length of `b` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- The list `bd` remains unchanged.
- The list `v` initially contains three elements: `[0, ad[i] / bd[i], ad[i] / bd[i]]`. After executing the code, `ad[i] / bd[i]` is appended to `v`, making it `[0, ad[i] / bd[i], ad[i] / bd[i], ad[i] / bd[i]]`.
- The list `a` must still have at least `len(b) + 2` elements.
