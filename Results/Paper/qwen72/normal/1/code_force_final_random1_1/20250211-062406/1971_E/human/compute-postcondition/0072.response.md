Output State: **`l` is equal to `q - 1`, `m` is the final calculated value, `ql` is the final adjusted value, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`, `t` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, and all other variables (`ad`, `bd`, `v`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.**

Explanation:
- The code `b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and appends these integers to a list that starts with 0.
- The variable `b` is updated to this new list.
- All other variables (`l`, `m`, `ql`, `s`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
