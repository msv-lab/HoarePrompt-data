Output State: **`i` is 1, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces, `len(b)` is greater than or equal to 1, `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `a` has at least `len(b) + (len(a) - 1)` elements, `q` is greater than 1, `l` is 2, `m` is 0, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index in `a` where `ql` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
