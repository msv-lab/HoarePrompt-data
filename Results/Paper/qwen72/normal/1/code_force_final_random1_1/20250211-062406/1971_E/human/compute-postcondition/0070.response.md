Output State: **`l` is equal to `q - 1`, `m` is the final calculated value, `ql` is the final adjusted value, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`, `t` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, and all other variables (`a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.**
