To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces.
- `len(b)` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`.
- `v` is a list where each element is the ratio of corresponding elements from `ad` and `bd`.
- `a` has at least `len(b) + (len(a) - 1)` elements.
- `q` is greater than 1.
- `l` is 1.
- `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.
- `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index in `a` where `ql` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.

### Analysis:
1. **List `b` and `bd`**:
   - `b` starts with 0 and is followed by integers from the input.
   - `bd` is the list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`.

2. **List `v`**:
   - `v` is a list where each element is the ratio of corresponding elements from `ad` and `bd`.

3. **Variable `m`**:
   - `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.

4. **Variable `ql`**:
   - `ql` is initially `q` and is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.

5. **Index `s`**:
   - `s` is the index in `a` where `ql` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the current iteration is skipped.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
- Since `b` starts with 0 and is followed by integers from the input, let's assume `b = [0, b1, b2, ...]`.
- `bd` will be `[b1 - 0, b2 - b1, ...] = [b1, b2 - b1, ...]`.
- `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.

Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for `a`, `ad`, and the input integers, we need to consider the general form of the calculation.

### Final Output:
- The value of `m` is calculated based on the given formula and the values of `b`, `bd`, `a`, `ad`, and `ql`.
- Since the exact values of `a`, `ad`, and the input integers are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the formula.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s])**
