The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `q`, and lists `a` and `b`. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `q`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`. It then processes `q` queries, where each query `d` is an integer. For each query, the function calculates and prints the time it takes to reach position `d` based on the known positions and times stored in `a` and `b`. The function prints the results of each query separated by spaces, and each test case's results are printed on a new line. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and all input variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `q`, etc.) retain their final states from the last test case.
