Output State: **`i` is `len(b) - 1`, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input split by spaces, `len(b)` is greater than or equal to 1, `bd` is a list that now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` (i.e., `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`).**

### Explanation:
- **`i` is `len(b) - 1`**: The loop iterates from `1` to `len(b) - 1`, so after all iterations, `i` will be `len(b) - 1`.
- **`b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input split by spaces**: The list `b` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`len(b)` is greater than or equal to 1**: For the loop to execute, `b` must have at least two elements (since it starts at index 1).
- **`bd` is a list that now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b`**: The list `bd` will contain the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `b`, starting from the second element. The first element of `bd` is always 0, as specified in the initial state. After the loop completes, `bd` will have `len(b) - 1` elements, each representing the difference between consecutive elements in `b`.
