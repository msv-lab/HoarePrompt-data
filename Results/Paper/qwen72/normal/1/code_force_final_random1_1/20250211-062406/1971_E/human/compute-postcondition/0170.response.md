To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces.
- `len(b)` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`.
- `v` is a list where each element is the ratio of corresponding elements from `ad` and `bd`.
- `a` has at least `len(b) + (len(a) - 1)` elements.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `l` is 0.
- `m` is 0.
- `ql` is an input integer.
- `s` is the index in `a` where `ql` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`.
- The value at index `s` in `a` is equal to `ql`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[s], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `b`**: This list starts with 0 and is followed by integers from the input. For example, if the input is "1 3 5", then `b` would be `[0, 1, 3, 5]`.

2. **List `bd`**: This list contains the differences between consecutive elements of `b`. For the example `b = [0, 1, 3, 5]`, `bd` would be `[1, 2, 2]`.

3. **List `v`**: This list contains the ratios of corresponding elements from `ad` and `bd`. However, the definition of `ad` is not provided, so we cannot compute `v` explicitly.

4. **List `a`**: This list has at least `len(b) + (len(a) - 1)` elements. The exact content of `a` is not specified, but it must be sorted.

5. **Variable `ql`**: This is an input integer.

6. **Index `s`**: This is the index in `a` where `ql` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`. The value at index `s` in `a` is equal to `ql`.

7. **Print Statement**: The statement `print(b[s], end=' ')` prints the element at index `s` of the list `b`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `s` is the index in `a` where `ql` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, and the value at index `s` in `a` is equal to `ql`, `s` is effectively the position in `a` where `ql` fits in the sorted order.
- The value `b[s]` is the element in the list `b` at the same index `s`.

### Example:
- Suppose the input is "1 3 5" and `ql` is 3.
- Then `b` would be `[0, 1, 3, 5]`.
- The value `ql` is 3, and the index `s` in `a` where 3 should be inserted to maintain the sorted order is 2 (assuming `a` is also `[0, 1, 3, 5]`).
- Therefore, `b[s]` is `b[2]`, which is 3.

### Final Output:
Output: **3** (where 3 is the element at index `s` in the list `b` and `s` is the index where `ql` should be inserted in the sorted list `a`).
