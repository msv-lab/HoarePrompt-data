Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l` is `q - 1`, `q` is greater than or equal to `q`, `m` is the final calculated value, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ql` is the final adjusted value, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`, if `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the element at index `s` in the list `a` is equal to `ql`, and the loop has completed all iterations specified by `t`. `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces. `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input split by spaces. `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input split by spaces. `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` (i.e., `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`). `bd` is a list containing only the value 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input split by spaces, `len(b)` is greater than 1, `bd` is a list that now includes the value `b[1] - b[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input split by spaces, `len(b)` is greater than 2, `bd` is a list that now includes the values `b[1] - b[0]` and `b[2] - b[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input split by spaces, `len(b)` is greater than 3, `bd` is a list that now includes the values `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[2] - b[1]`, `b[3] - b[2]`, and `b[3] - b[2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
