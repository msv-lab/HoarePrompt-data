Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user and must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user from the second input, `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b` for all elements in `b` except the last one, `i` is 2, `len(b)` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `v` is a list containing 0, `ad[1] / bd[1]`, and `ad[2] / bd[2]`.**
