Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l` is equal to `q - 1`, `m` is the final calculated value, `ql` is the final adjusted value, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`, `t` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least `len(b)` elements, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]]`, `bd` is `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]]`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
    print(int(m), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` is 0, `q` is greater than 0, `m` is `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, and `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the element at index `s` in the list `a` is equal to `ql`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `l` is 1, `q` is greater than 1, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the element at index `s` in the list `a` is equal to `ql`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l` is 2, `q` is greater than 2, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
