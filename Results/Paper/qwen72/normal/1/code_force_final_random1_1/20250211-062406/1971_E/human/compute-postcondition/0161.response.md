To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `i` is `len(b)`
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces
- `len(b)` is greater than or equal to 1
- `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`
- `v` is `[0, ad[i] / bd[i], ad[i] / bd[i]]`
- `a` must have at least `len(b) + 1` elements

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(b)`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `len(b) + 1`.
- The loop condition is `i < len(a)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `len(a)` must be greater than `len(b) + 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to `len(b) + 1`.
- `len(a)` must be greater than `len(b) + 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `len(b) + 1`, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces, `len(b)` is greater than or equal to 1, `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, ad[i] / bd[i], ad[i] / bd[i]]`, `a` must have at least `len(b) + 2` elements.**
