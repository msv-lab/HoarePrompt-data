Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and q are integers where k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 10^5, representing the final destination, the number of known time points, and the number of queries, respectively. a is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, with a_k = n. b is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1. Each query d is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ n. The sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    ad = [0]
    bd = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
    v = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
    for l in range(q):
        m = 0
        i = 1
        ql = int(input())
        s = bisect_left(a, ql)
        if a[s] == ql:
            print(b[s], end=' ')
            continue
        ql -= a[s - 1]
        m += b[s - 1]
        m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
        print(int(m), end=' ')
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `l` is equal to `q - 1`, `m` is the final calculated value based on the formula `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` for the last iteration, `ql` is the final adjusted value after subtracting `a[s - 1]` for the last iteration, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql` for the last iteration, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `l` is `q - 1`, `q` is greater than or equal to `q`, `m` is the final calculated value, `i` is 1, `ql` is the final adjusted value, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the element at index `s` in the list `a` is equal to `ql`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces, `len(b)` is greater than or equal to 1, `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `a` has at least `len(b) + (len(a) - 1)` elements, `q` is the total number of iterations, `l` is `q - 1`, `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` for each iteration, `ql` is the integer value of the user input minus `a[s - 1]` for each iteration, `s` is the index in `a` where the original `ql` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`. If `a[s]` is equal to the original `ql`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, but no variables are modified.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
