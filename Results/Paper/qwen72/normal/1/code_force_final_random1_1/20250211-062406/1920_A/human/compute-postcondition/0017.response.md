Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` is 3, and `v` is an integer from the input. If `t` is 2, `start` remains unchanged. If `end` > `v`, `end` is updated to `v`. Otherwise, `end` remains unchanged. If `t` is 1 and `start` < `v`, `start` is updated to `v`. Otherwise, `start` remains unchanged.**
