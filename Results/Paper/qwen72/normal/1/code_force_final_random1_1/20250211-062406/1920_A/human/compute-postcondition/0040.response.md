Output State: **After all iterations, `n` is the total number of iterations performed, `i` is `n-1`, `start` is the maximum value encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value encountered when `t` is 2, and `num` is a list containing all values encountered when `t` is 3. The initial values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged if no updates were made during the loop.**

Explanation:
- `n` remains the total number of iterations as specified initially.
- `i` will be `n-1` because the loop index starts at 0 and goes up to `n-1`.
- `start` will be the highest value encountered when `t` is 1, or it will remain `-1` if no such updates occurred.
- `end` will be the lowest value encountered when `t` is 2, or it will remain `1000000000.0` if no such updates occurred.
- `num` will be a list containing all values `v` where `t` was 3, in the order they were encountered. If no such values were encountered, `num` will remain an empty list.
