Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `t` and `v` are integers from the input. If `t` is 2, `start` remains unchanged. If `end` > `v`, `end` is updated to `v`. Otherwise, `end` remains unchanged. If `t` is 1 and `start` < `v`, `start` is updated to `v`. Otherwise, `start` remains unchanged.***
