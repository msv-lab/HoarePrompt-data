Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` and `v` are integers from the input, `start` and `end` are updated based on the conditions described, and if `t` is 3, `num` is a list that now includes `v` as its new last element.**

Explanation:
- The code `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `t` and `v`.
- The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `start` and `end` are updated based on certain conditions. These conditions are not affected by the code snippet provided.
- The initial state also mentions that if `t` is 3, `num` is a list that now includes `v` as its new last element. This condition remains unchanged by the code snippet.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the same conditions as the initial state, with `t` and `v` now holding the values read from the input.
