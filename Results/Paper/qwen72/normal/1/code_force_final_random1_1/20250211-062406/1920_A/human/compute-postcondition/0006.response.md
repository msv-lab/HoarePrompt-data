The code snippet `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `t` and `v`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0

After executing the code, the variables `t` and `v` will be assigned the values from the input. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` and `v` are integers from the input.**
