The code snippet `count_num += 1` increments the value of `count_num` by 1. The conditions regarding `i`, `start`, and `end` are assumed to have been met, as the code is only executed if these conditions are satisfied. The initial state specifies that `i` is the second element in `num`, and if `i` is within the range defined by `start` and `end`, `count_num` is incremented. Since the code is being executed, it means `i` is indeed within the specified range.

Output State: **`num` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `num`, `i` is greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`, `count_num` is increased by 1.**
