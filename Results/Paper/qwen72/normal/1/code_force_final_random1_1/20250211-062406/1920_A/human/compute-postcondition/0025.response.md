Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` and `v` are integers from the input. If `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`, `start` is updated to `v`, `end` is now `v`. If `t` is 1 and `start` is not less than `v`, `start` remains unchanged, `end` is now `v`. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list that now includes `v` as its new last element, and `end` is now `v`. If `t` is not 1, `start` and `end` remain unchanged, and if `t` is 3, `num` is a list that now includes `v` as its new last element, and `end` is now `v`.**
