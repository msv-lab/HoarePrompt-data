Postcondition: ***`num` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element in `num`. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`, `count_num` is increased by 1.***
