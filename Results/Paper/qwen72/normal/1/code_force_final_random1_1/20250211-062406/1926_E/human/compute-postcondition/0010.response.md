Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are input integers, `n` must be non-zero and greater than 1, `L` is [m], `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2` which is `((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n - ((n + 1) // 2)` which simplifies to `n - m`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` is a non-zero integer greater than 1.
- `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `n` is then updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `n - m`.
- After this update, `m` is further updated to `(n + 1) // 2`, which is now `((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2`.
- The final value of `n` is `n - m`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
