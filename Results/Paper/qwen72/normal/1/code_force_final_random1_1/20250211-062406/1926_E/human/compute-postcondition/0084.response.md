Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is \(-(n + 1) // 2\) and must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing \((n + 1) // 2\) and \((n + 1) // 2\), `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is \((n + 1) // 2\)**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is reassigned to \((n + 1) // 2\). Since this is the same value that `m` already holds, there is no change in the value of `m`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `tot`, `pow`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
