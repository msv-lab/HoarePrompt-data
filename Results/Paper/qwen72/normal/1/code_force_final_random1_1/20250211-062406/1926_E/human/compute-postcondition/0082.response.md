Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is \(-(n + 1) // 2\), `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing \((n + 1) // 2\) and \((n + 1) // 2\), `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is \((n + 1) // 2\).**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains greater than 0.
- The value of `n` remains \(-(n + 1) // 2\).
- The value of `k` remains an input integer.
- The list `L` initially contains \((n + 1) // 2\). After appending `m`, which is also \((n + 1) // 2\), `L` now contains two elements, both \((n + 1) // 2\).
- The value of `tot` remains 0.
- The value of `pow` remains 1.
- The value of `m` remains \((n + 1) // 2\).
