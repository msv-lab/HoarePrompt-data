Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing all the elements added during the loop iterations, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is the last value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` becomes 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
    tot += a
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing at least one element, `tot` is `a`, `pow` is 2, `m` is the last value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` becomes 0. If `a` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `2a`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing at least two elements, `a` is the next element in `L`, `pow` is 4, `m` is the last value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` becomes 0, `tot` is now `tot + a`, and if `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then the conditions remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing at least two elements, `a` is the second element in `L`, `pow` is 8, `m` is the last value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` becomes 0, and `tot` is now `tot + a`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, then `tot` remains `tot + a`. Otherwise, `tot` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
