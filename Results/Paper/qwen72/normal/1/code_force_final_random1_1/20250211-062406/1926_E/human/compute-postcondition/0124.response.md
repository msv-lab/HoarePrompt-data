Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9). For each test case, if `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, it calculates a value `y` using a specific formula and prints it. Otherwise, it prints `2 * k - 1`. The function handles up to `t` test cases (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4). After processing all test cases, the function has printed a sequence of values, one for each test case. **
