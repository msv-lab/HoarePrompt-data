You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` (where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9`). It then performs a series of calculations to generate a sequence of values and prints a specific result based on the value of `k` and the sequence generated. After processing all test cases, the function terminates without returning any value. The final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed, and the corresponding results have been printed to the standard output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order: first the odd numbers, then the numbers that are twice an odd number, then three times an odd number, and so on.
   - We need to find the k-th card laid down in this process.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes an empty list `L` to store the number of cards laid down at each step.
   - The loop `while n:` continues until all cards are laid down.
     - `m = (n + 1) // 2` calculates the number of cards that can be laid down in the current step.
     - `n -= m` updates the remaining number of cards.
     - `L.append(m)` appends the number of cards laid down in the current step to the list `L`.
   - After determining the number of cards laid down at each step, the program iterates through the list `L` to find the k-th card.
     - `tot` keeps track of the cumulative number of cards laid down.
     - `pow` starts at 1 and is doubled in each iteration to represent the multiplier (1, 2, 4, 8, ...).
     - If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, it means the k-th card is in the current step.
     - The k-th card is calculated as `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
     - `tot` is updated to include the current step's cards.
     - `pow` is doubled for the next step.

3. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of cards laid down at each step.
   - It correctly identifies the step in which the k-th card is laid down.
   - The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` correctly calculates the k-th card based on the step and the position within the step.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output as required and follows the logic to determine the k-th card laid down.
