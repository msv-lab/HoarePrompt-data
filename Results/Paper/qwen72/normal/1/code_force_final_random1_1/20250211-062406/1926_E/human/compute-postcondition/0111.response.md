To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `p <= i - 1`.

### Current State:
- `p` is 3
- `i` must be at least 3

### Analysis:
- The loop condition `p <= i - 1` must be true for the loop to execute again.
- Given that `i` must be at least 3, the smallest possible value for `i` is 3.
- For `p` to be less than or equal to `i - 1`, `p` must be less than or equal to 2 when `i` is 3.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since `p` is currently 3, and `i` is at least 3, the condition `p <= i - 1` (which simplifies to `3 <= 2`) is false.
- To make the condition true, `p` must be adjusted to a value that is less than or equal to `i - 1`.
- The simplest adjustment is to set `p` to 2, which would satisfy the condition `p <= i - 1` when `i` is at least 3.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `s` is `k`, `i` must be at least 3, `d` is 0, `h` is `(n + 1) // 4 - ((n + 1) // 4 + 1) // 2`, `p` is 2, `g` is `(n + 1) // 2 + ((n + 1) // 4 + 1) // 2`, and `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\)**
