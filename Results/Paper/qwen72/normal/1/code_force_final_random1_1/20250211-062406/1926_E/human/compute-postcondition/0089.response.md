Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values \((n + 1) // 2\) calculated during each iteration until `n` becomes 0, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is the last value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` becomes 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `tot = 0` sets the variable `tot` to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `pow`, `m`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `tot` while keeping the rest of the variables in their initial state.
