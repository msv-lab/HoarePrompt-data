Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. For each iteration, if `k` > (n + 1) // 2, then `s` is `k`, `i` is the number of iterations it took for `s` to reach or exceed `k`, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is the sum of the series \((n + 1) // 2 + (h_1 + 1) // 2 + (h_2 + 1) // 2 + ... + (h_{i-1} + 1) // 2\), `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times f - 1)\). Otherwise, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\). The loop has executed `t` times, and the final output is the sequence of `y` values or `2 * k - 1` values for each test case.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. For each test case, the loop either calculates and prints a value `y` based on a specific formula if `k` is greater than half of `n`, or it prints `2 * k - 1` if `k` is less than or equal to half of `n`. The loop iterates `t` times, and the final state reflects the results of these calculations for each test case.
