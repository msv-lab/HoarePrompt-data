The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from it. Given that `m` is defined as \((n + 1) // 2\), the new value of `n` is \(n - (n + 1) // 2\). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is \(n - (n + 1) // 2\), `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is \((n + 1) // 2\) (before the update)**.
