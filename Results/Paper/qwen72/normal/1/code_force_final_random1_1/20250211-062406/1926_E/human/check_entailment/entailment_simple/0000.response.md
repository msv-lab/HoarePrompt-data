Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem by breaking down the process into steps where it calculates how many cards are placed in each step (odd numbers, twice odd numbers, etc.). The key logic involves calculating the number of cards that can be placed in each step and keeping track of the cumulative count to determine when the k-th card is placed.

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
2. **Initialization**: It initializes an empty list `L` to store the number of cards placed in each step.
3. **Calculating Cards per Step**: It uses a loop to calculate the number of cards that can be placed in each step. For each step, it calculates `m` as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of cards that can be placed in the current step. It then subtracts `m` from `n` and appends `m` to the list `L`.
4. **Finding the k-th Card**: It initializes `tot` to 0 and `pow` to 1. It iterates over the list `L` to find the step where the k-th card is placed. If `k` falls within the range of cards placed in the current step, it prints the k-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`. It updates `tot` and `pow` accordingly.
5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the k-th card for each test case.

The program's logic aligns with the problem description and handles the constraints effectively. It correctly identifies the k-th card by breaking down the placement process into manageable steps and tracking the cumulative count of cards placed.

Correctness: **True**
