To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `L` is a list containing at least one element.
- `tot` is 0.
- `pow` is 1.
- `m` is the last value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` becomes 0.
- `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `t` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `L` is a list with at least one element.
   - `tot` is 0.
   - `pow` is 1.
   - `m` is the last value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` becomes 0. Since `n` is 0, \((n + 1) // 2\) is \((0 + 1) // 2 = 0.5 // 2 = 0\). Therefore, `m` is 0.
   - `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`. This implies that `k` is a value between `tot` (which is 0) and `tot + a` (where `a` is some positive integer).

2. **Expression Inside the Print Statement:**
   - The expression is `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - `pow` is 1.
   - `tot` is 0.
   - `k` is an integer such that `0 < k <= a`.

3. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` simplifies to `1 * (2 * (k - 0) - 1)`.
   - This further simplifies to `2 * k - 1`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of `2 * k - 1`, where `k` is an integer such that `0 < k <= a`.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is an integer such that 0 < k <= a)**
