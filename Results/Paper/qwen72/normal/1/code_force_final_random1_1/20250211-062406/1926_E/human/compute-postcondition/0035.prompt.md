Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are input integers, `n` is 0, `L` is a list of integers where each element is `(n + 1) // 2` from each iteration, and the sum of the elements in `L` equals the initial value of `n`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
    tot += a
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `L` is a list of integers with at least one element, `tot` is `tot + a`, `pow` is 2. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `L` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `pow` is 4, `a` is the second element in the list, `tot` is updated to `tot + a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `L` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `pow` is 8, `a` is the third element in the list, `tot` is updated to `tot + a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
