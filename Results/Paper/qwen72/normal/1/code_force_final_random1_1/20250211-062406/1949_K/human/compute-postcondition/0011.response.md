Output State: **The program returns 'YES', along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. These lists contain the elements from the original `numbers` list distributed according to the `distribute_number` function, ensuring that the sums of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` satisfy the condition that `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` returns `True`.**
