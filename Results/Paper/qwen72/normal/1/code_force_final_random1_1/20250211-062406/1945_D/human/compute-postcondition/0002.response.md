The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `na_frente` and `pos_final`. The initial state provides several variables and their constraints, but only `na_frente` and `pos_final` are updated by the code. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 200,000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `b` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\), `cases` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` and `pos_final` are integers read from the input.**
