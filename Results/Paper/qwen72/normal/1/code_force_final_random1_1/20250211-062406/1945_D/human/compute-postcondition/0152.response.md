To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object in the loop head, which is the variable `y` and the list `a`.

According to the code, the loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute at least once, the list `a` must contain at least one element. The state of `y` will be the first element of `a` when the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute, `a` must have at least one element, and `y` should be set to the first element of `a`.

State: **`custos` now includes the current value of `custo` which is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces and must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `y` is the first element in `a`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x`, `a_values` remain unchanged**
