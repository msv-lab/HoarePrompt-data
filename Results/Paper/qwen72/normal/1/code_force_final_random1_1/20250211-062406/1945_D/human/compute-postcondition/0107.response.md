Output State: **`pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is 0, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `v` is `na_frente`, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `best` is updated to be the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
