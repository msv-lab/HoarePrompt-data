To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop statement:

```python
for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `y` and the expressions `num_fila - 1` and `max_p - 1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `custos` includes the current value of `custo`, which is either `a_values[y]` if `a_values[y] < b_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y] >= b_values[y]`.
   - `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
   - `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf` and must be greater than or equal to `max_p`.
   - `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`.
   - `b_values` includes the integer values of all elements in `b`.
   - `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces.
   - `a` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces.
   - `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces.
   - `t`, `n`, `m`, `x` remain unchanged.
   - `a_values` includes the integer values of all elements in `a`.

3. **Adjustments Needed for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over `y` in reverse order from `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1` (inclusive).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `y` must still be greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `y` should be decremented by 1.
- The condition `y >= max_p - 1` must still hold true.

Given the current state:
- `y` was the value of `num_fila - 1` at the start of the previous iteration.
- After the previous iteration, `y` would be `num_fila - 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `y` should be `num_fila - 2`.
- `num_fila` and `max_p` remain the same.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`custos` includes the current value of `custo`, which is either `a_values[y]` if `a_values[y] < b_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y] >= b_values[y]`. `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf` and must be greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `b_values` includes the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x` remain unchanged, and `a_values` includes the integer values of all elements in `a`. `y` is `num_fila - 2` and must be greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`.**
