Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe the person at position i and the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `x` is an input integer. `custos` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    custo = 0
    num_fila = 0
    max_p = 0
    a_values = []
    b_values = []
    nf = input().split()
    num_fila = int(nf[0])
    max_p = int(nf[1])
    a = input().split()
    b = input().split()
    for y in a:
        a_values.append(int(y))
    for y in b:
        b_values.append(int(y))
    for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
        if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
            custo += a_values[y]
        else:
            custo += b_values[y]
    for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
        if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
            custo += b_values[y]
            if y == 1:
                custo += a_values[0]
                break
        else:
            custo += a_values[y]
            break
    custos.append(custo)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `b` is a list of strings from the new input, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]` and must be greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]` and must be greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all the strings in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all the strings in `b`, `nf` is a list of strings from the input, `y` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `custos` now includes the current value of `custo`, all other variables (`b_values`, `y`, `max_p`, `num_fila`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `x`, `i`, `custos`, `a_values`, `nf`) remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `custos` now includes the final value of `custo`, and all other variables (`i`, `num_fila`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x`, and `a_values`) remain unchanged as described in the initial state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
