Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 200,000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `b` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\), `cases` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input, `v` is `na_frente`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated to `total + min(custo_pra_trocar_a[v], custo_pra_passar_b[v])`. If `best` is greater than the new value of `total`, then `best` is updated to the new value of `total`. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is updated to `total + min(custo_pra_trocar_a[v], custo_pra_passar_b[v])`.***
