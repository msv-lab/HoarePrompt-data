Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `pos_final` is equal to `na_frente`. In this scenario, Kirill is already in the desired position, and no bribes are necessary. However, the current implementation still calculates and adds costs, which is incorrect. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
2 2
2 3
1 1
```

Here, Kirill is already in the 2nd position, so the cost should be 0. However, the program will incorrectly calculate a cost because it does not check if `pos_final` is equal to `na_frente` before performing any calculations. This leads to an incorrect result.
