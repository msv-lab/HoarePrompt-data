The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `y` relative to `0`. The loop decrements `y` by 1 each iteration, starting from `max_p - 1` and ending when `y` is no longer greater than `0`.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `max_p - 2` or less, and `max_p` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1, making it `max_p - 3` or less, but still greater than `0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`y` is `max_p - 3` or less, `max_p` is greater than 1, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` starting from index `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 3`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`. If `y` is 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]`. If `a_values[max_p - 3] + b_values[max_p - 2]` is greater than `a_values[max_p - 2]`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[max_p - 2]`. `custos` includes the final value of `custo`, and all other variables (`i`, `num_fila`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x`, and `a_values`) remain unchanged as described in the initial state.**
