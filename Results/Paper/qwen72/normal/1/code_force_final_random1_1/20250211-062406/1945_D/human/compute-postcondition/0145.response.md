The function `func` does not explicitly show its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters, including an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b` of length `n`.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `b` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function processes these inputs and returns some result based on the inputs. Since the specific output is not provided, I will assume the function returns a result for each test case, which could be a list of results corresponding to each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b` of length `n`. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
