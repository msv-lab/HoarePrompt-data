The code snippet `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` updates the value of `total` by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it. Given the initial state, `total` was initially set to the smaller of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. After executing the code, `total` is now the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`) remain unchanged and must still be at least 0. The variable `v` remains `na_frente - 1`. The arrays `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` also remain unchanged.

If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and if `best` is greater than the new value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` would be updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. However, since the code snippet only updates `total` and does not include the conditional logic to update `best`, `best` remains 1000000000000 unless explicitly updated elsewhere in the program.

Output State: **`pos_final` is decreased by 1, `total` is now the sum of the smaller of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged, `best` remains 1000000000000.**
