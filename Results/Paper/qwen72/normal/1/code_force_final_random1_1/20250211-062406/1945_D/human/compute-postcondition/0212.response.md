The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that references a variable `c`. However, the initial state only mentions a list `custos` containing the calculated costs for each of the `t` test cases, and it specifies that `custos` must have at least one element. The variable `c` is not explicitly defined in the initial state or within the code snippet.

Given this information, it is not clear what `c` refers to. If `c` is intended to be an element from the `custos` list, it would need to be indexed properly, such as `custos[0]` for the first element. Since `c` is not defined, attempting to print it will result in a `NameError`.

However, if we assume that `c` is meant to be the first element of the `custos` list (a common assumption when a variable is not explicitly defined), the output would be the first element of the `custos` list.

Output: **c (where c is the first element of the custos list)**

If `c` is not intended to be the first element of `custos` and is instead a different variable, the code will raise a `NameError` because `c` is not defined. In that case:

Output: **NameError: name 'c' is not defined**
