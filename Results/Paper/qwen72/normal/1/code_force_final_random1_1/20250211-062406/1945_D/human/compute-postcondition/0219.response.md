Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of people in a queue (`n`), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (`m`), the cost to bribe each person in the queue (`a`), and the cost to bribe each person between positions (`b`). For each test case, it calculates the minimum total cost for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` in the queue. The function then prints the calculated cost for each test case. If the input is invalid or the task is impossible, the function does not handle these cases explicitly and may produce incorrect results. **
