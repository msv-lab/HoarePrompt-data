Output State: **After the loop completes all its iterations, `y` is 0 or less, indicating the loop has finished executing. `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` starting from index `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`, and if `y` is 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`. The loop breaks when `y` reaches 1 and the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` is met, or when `y` is 1 and the loop adds `a_values[0]` to `custo`. `custos` includes the final value of `custo`, and all other variables (`i`, `num_fila`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x`, and `a_values`) remain unchanged as described in the initial state.**
