The only object in the loop head is the variable `c` and the variable `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c` being less than `cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` was equal to `cases - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `cases`.

However, since `c` is now equal to `cases`, the condition `c < cases` will no longer be true, and the loop will not execute again. Therefore, the loop has completed all its iterations.

State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged. The variable `v` will be `-1`. The variable `total` will be the sum of the minimum costs (`min(custo_pra_trocar_a[v], custo_pra_passar_b[v])`) for each `v` from `na_frente` down to `0` (inclusive). The variable `best` will be the minimum value between the initial `best` and the updated `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each `v` where `v <= pos_final`. `c` is now equal to `cases`.**
