The code snippet `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` updates the value of `total` by adding the value at index `v` in the list `custo_pra_passar_b` to the current value of `total`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 200,000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)
- `b` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\)
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\)
- `cases` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0
- `c` is 0
- `na_frente` is at least 0
- `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input
- `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input
- `v` is `na_frente - 1`
- `total` is a variable (initial value not specified)

After executing the code snippet:
- `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 200,000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `b` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\), `cases` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`.**
