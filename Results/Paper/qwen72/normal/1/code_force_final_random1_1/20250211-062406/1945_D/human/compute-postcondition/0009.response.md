To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `v`, `na_frente`, and the range parameters. The loop iterates from `na_frente` down to `-1` in steps of `-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `na_frente` must be at least `0` (since the loop stops when `v` reaches `-1`).

Given the initial state:
- `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`.

To make the loop execute, we need to adjust `na_frente` to be at least `0`. Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect that `na_frente` is at least `0` and `v` starts at `na_frente`.

State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 200,000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `b` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\), `cases` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input, `total` is 0, `best` is \(10^{12}\), `v` is `na_frente`**.
