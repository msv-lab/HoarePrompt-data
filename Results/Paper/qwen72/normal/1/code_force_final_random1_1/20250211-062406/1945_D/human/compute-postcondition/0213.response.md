The only object in the loop head is the list `custos`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `custos`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `custos`.

At the end of the last iteration, `custos` is a list containing the calculated costs for each of the `t` test cases and must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `custos` must have at least two elements.

State: **`custos` is a list containing the calculated costs for each of the `t` test cases and must have at least two elements**
