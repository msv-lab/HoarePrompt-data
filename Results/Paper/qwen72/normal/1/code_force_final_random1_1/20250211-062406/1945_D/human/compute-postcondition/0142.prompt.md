Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is 0, `best` is 10
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` and `custo_pra_trocar_a` are lists of integers obtained from the input, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `v` is `na_frente`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]` and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` before the update. Otherwise, `total` is updated to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is updated by adding either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on which is smaller, and `best` remains 10.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` and `custo_pra_trocar_a` are lists of integers obtained from the input, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `v` is `na_frente - 1`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]` and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` before the update. Otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` and `best` remains unchanged. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is updated by adding either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on which is smaller, and `best` remains 10.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` and `custo_pra_trocar_a` are lists of integers obtained from the input, `na_frente` must be at least 1, `v` is `na_frente - 2`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` before the update. Otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` and `best` remains unchanged. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is updated by adding the smaller of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` remains 10.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
