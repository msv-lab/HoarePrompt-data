Postcondition: ***`pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` and `custo_pra_trocar_a` are lists of integers obtained from the input, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `v` is `na_frente - 1`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]` and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` before the update. Otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` and `best` remains unchanged. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is updated by adding either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on which is smaller, and `best` remains 10.***
