To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for y in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `y` and the list `a`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `y` is the second element in `a`.
   - `a` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces and must have at least 2 elements.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be set to the next element in `a`.
   - The list `a` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again.

### Adjusted State:
- `y` should be the third element in `a`.
- `a` must have at least 3 elements.

### Final State:
State: **`custos` now includes the current value of `custo` which is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces and must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `y` is the third element in `a`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x` remain unchanged, `a_values` now includes the integer value of the first element in `a` and the integer value of the second element in `a`.**
