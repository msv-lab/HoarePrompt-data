Output State: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `pos_final` will be decreased by 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` and `custo_pra_trocar_a` will remain as lists of integers obtained from the input, `total` will be the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` will be the minimum value between the initial `best` (10) and the sum of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` where `v <= pos_final`. The variable `v` will be -1, indicating the loop has completed its iterations.**
