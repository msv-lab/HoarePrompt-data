Output State: **After the loop has completed all its iterations, `custo` will be the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` starting from index `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`. The variable `custos` will include the final value of `custo`. The variable `y` will be `max_p - 1` (or less, depending on the number of iterations). All other variables (`i`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x`, and `a_values`) will remain unchanged as described in the initial state.**
