Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop has completed all its iterations, `custo` will be the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` starting from index `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`. The variable `custos` will include the final value of `custo`. The variable `y` will be `max_p - 1` (or less, depending on the number of iterations). All other variables (`i`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x`, and `a_values`) will remain unchanged as described in the initial state.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
    if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
        custo += b_values[y]
        if y == 1:
            custo += a_values[0]
            break
    else:
        custo += a_values[y]
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`y` is `max_p - 1` or less, `max_p` is greater than 1, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` starting from index `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`, and if `y` is 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]`. If `a_values[max_p - 2] + b_values[max_p - 1]` is greater than `a_values[max_p - 1]`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[max_p - 1]`. `custos` includes the final value of `custo`, and all other variables (`i`, `num_fila`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x`, and `a_values`) remain unchanged as described in the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`y` is `max_p - 2` or less, `max_p` is greater than 1, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` starting from index `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 2`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`. If `y` is 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]`. If `a_values[max_p - 2] + b_values[max_p - 1]` is greater than `a_values[max_p - 1]`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[max_p - 1]`. `custos` includes the final value of `custo`, and all other variables (`i`, `num_fila`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x`, and `a_values`) remain unchanged as described in the initial state. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`. In either case, if `y` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `y` is `max_p - 3` or less, `max_p` is greater than 1, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` starting from index `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 3`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`. If `y` is 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]`. If `a_values[max_p - 3] + b_values[max_p - 2]` is greater than `a_values[max_p - 2]`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[max_p - 2]`. `custos` includes the final value of `custo`, and all other variables (`i`, `num_fila`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x`, and `a_values`) remain unchanged as described in the initial state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
