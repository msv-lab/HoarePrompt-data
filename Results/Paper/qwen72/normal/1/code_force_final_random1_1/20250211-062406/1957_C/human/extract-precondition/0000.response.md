Precondition: **n is an integer representing the size of the chessboard, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5.** 

However, the provided function definition `def func_1(n):` does not match the complexity of the problem described. The function should accept multiple parameters to handle the test cases, the size of the chessboard, and the moves made. A more appropriate function definition would be:

```python
def count_final_configurations(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `k`, and a list of moves `(r_i, c_i)`.

Given this, the precondition should be updated to reflect the actual inputs to the function:

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5), k (0 ≤ k ≤ n), and a list of k moves, where each move is a tuple (r_i, c_i) with 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n.**
