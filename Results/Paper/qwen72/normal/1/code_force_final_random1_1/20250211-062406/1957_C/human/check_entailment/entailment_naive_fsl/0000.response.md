Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `r = c` correctly. According to the problem description, if `r = c`, the computer skips its turn. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario. Specifically, the program adds both `r` and `c` to the `invalid` set, which would incorrectly mark the mirrored position as invalid even when `r = c`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 1
2 2
```
After the first move, the board will have a white rook at (2, 2). The computer should skip its turn because `r = c`. However, the program will incorrectly add both 2 and 2 to the `invalid` set, treating the mirrored position as invalid. This leads to an incorrect count of possible final configurations.
