Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of calculating the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard, given the rules for placing rooks and the mirroring behavior of the computer. Let's break down the components of the program to assess its correctness:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization and Precomputation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes the dynamic programming array `dp` with base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - It then iterates from 3 to `n`, filling in the `dp` array using the recurrence relation:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \cdot (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
     \]
   - This recurrence relation correctly captures the number of ways to place rooks on an \( i \times i \) board, considering the constraints of the problem.

2. **Reading Input and Processing Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the board `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and adds the rows and columns of these moves to a set `invalid` to keep track of positions that cannot be used for placing additional rooks.

3. **Calculating the Result**:
   - The program calculates the number of valid configurations by looking up the precomputed `dp` value for the remaining available positions, which is `n - len(invalid)`.
   - It prints the result, ensuring it is at least 1 (since there is always at least one configuration).

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints well, including the large values of `n` and `k`.
   - The use of modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) ensures that the results fit within standard integer limits.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The dynamic programming approach is sound, and the handling of input and output is appropriate.

Correctness: **True**
