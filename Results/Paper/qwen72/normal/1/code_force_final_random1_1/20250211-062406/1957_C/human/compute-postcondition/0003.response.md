The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. Given the initial state:

- `n` must be at least 3
- `i` is 3
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3

We can calculate the new value of `dp[3]` as follows:

1. `dp[i - 1]` is `dp[2]`, which is 3.
2. `2 * (i - 1)` is `2 * (3 - 1)`, which is 4.
3. `dp[i - 2]` is `dp[1]`, which is 1.
4. The expression `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` evaluates to `4 * 1`, which is 4.
5. The expression `dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` evaluates to `3 + 4`, which is 7.
6. The final value of `dp[3]` is `7 % 1000000007`, which is 7.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7**
