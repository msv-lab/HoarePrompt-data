You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the size of the chessboard, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5.
def func_1(n):
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains the same as the initial value, `i` is `n + 1`, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[n]` contains the final computed value based on the given recurrence relation. The exact value of `dp[n]` depends on the specific value of `n` and is calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` for each iteration from 3 to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the size of a chessboard, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5. It computes a sequence `dp` using a specific recurrence relation and returns no explicit value. After the function completes, the variable `n` remains unchanged, and the array `dp` is populated such that `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[n]` contains the final computed value based on the recurrence relation `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. The function modifies the `dp` array in place.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The function `func_1` initializes the dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` to store the number of valid configurations for a given number of rows (or columns). The base cases are correctly set as `dp[1] = 1` (one way to place a rook in a 1x1 grid) and `dp[2] = 3` (three ways to place rooks in a 2x2 grid without attacking each other).

2. **DP Transition**: The transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is correct. This formula accounts for the following:
   - Placing a rook in the i-th row and i-th column, which leaves `dp[i-1]` configurations for the remaining (i-1)x(i-1) grid.
   - Placing a rook in the i-th row and any of the (i-1) columns, and then placing a rook in the corresponding column and any of the (i-1) rows, which leaves `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` configurations for the remaining (i-2)x(i-2) grid.

3. **Input Handling**: The main loop reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.

4. **Invalid Positions**: The set `invalid` is used to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks due to the initial moves. This ensures that these positions are not considered for further placements.

5. **Final Configuration Calculation**: The number of valid configurations for the remaining rows and columns (after accounting for the initial moves) is calculated using `dp[n - len(invalid)]`. This is correct because the DP array `dp` stores the number of valid configurations for a given number of rows (or columns).

6. **Edge Case Handling**: The `max(1, ...)` ensures that if there are no remaining rows or columns to place rooks, the result is 1 (since an empty board is also a valid configuration).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
