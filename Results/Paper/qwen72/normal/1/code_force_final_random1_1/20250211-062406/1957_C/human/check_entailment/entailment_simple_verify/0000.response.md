Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program indeed fails to handle the case where `r = c` correctly. When `r = c`, the computer skips its turn, meaning the mirrored position should not be marked as invalid. However, the current implementation adds both `r` and `c` to the `invalid` set, which incorrectly marks the mirrored position as invalid even when `r = c`.

To illustrate, consider the example provided in the original assessment:
```
1
4 1
2 2
```
- After the first move, the board will have a white rook at (2, 2).
- The computer should skip its turn because `r = c`.
- However, the program adds both 2 and 2 to the `invalid` set, treating the mirrored position as invalid.
- This leads to an incorrect count of possible final configurations.

The correct behavior should be to only add `r` (or `c`) to the `invalid` set when `r = c`, ensuring that the mirrored position is not incorrectly marked as invalid.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is correct.

Final: **False**
