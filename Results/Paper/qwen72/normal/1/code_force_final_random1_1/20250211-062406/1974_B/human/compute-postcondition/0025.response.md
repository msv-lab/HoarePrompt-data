Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 2, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the original `s`, `char` is the next character in the original `s`, `i` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the previous condition, and `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 3`, `len(unique_chars) - 1`, `len(unique_chars)`, `len(unique_chars) - 2`, `len(unique_chars) + 1`, or `len(unique_chars) + 2` depending on the previous condition. If `char` is in `unique_chars`, `s` is updated by replacing all occurrences of `char` with `unique_chars[j]`, and `j` is adjusted accordingly. If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `char` is inserted into `unique_chars` at index `i`, and `unique_chars` has a new length of `len(unique_chars) + 1`, while `i` and `j` are adjusted accordingly.***
