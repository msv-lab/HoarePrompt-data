The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `j` was `len(unique_chars)`, so now `j` is `len(unique_chars) + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 2, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s` with `char` inserted at index 1, `i` is 2, and `j` is `len(unique_chars) + 1`.**
