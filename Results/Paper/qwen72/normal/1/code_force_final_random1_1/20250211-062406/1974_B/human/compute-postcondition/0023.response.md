Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 2, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from the original `s` with `char` inserted at index `i`, `char` is the next character in `s`, `i` is 1 or 2 or 3 depending on the previous condition, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2` or `len(unique_chars)` or `len(unique_chars) + 1` depending on the previous condition, and `unique_chars` has a new length of `len(unique_chars) + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`s`, `unique_chars`, `char`, `j`) remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `i` and `j` depend on the initial conditions provided, but `i` is now one more than its previous value.
