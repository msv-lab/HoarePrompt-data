Reasoning:

The provided program aims to decode a string that was encoded according to a specific algorithm. The decoding process should reverse the steps of the encoding process. However, the implementation in `func_1` does not correctly achieve this goal. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Character Replacement**: The function attempts to replace characters in the string `s` with characters from the `unique_chars` list, but it does so in a way that does not follow the symmetric replacement rule. Specifically, it replaces each character in `s` with the last character in `unique_chars` and then decrements `j`. This results in all characters being replaced by the same character, which is incorrect.

2. **Modification of `unique_chars` List**: The function incorrectly modifies the `unique_chars` list by inserting characters that are not in `unique_chars`. This is unnecessary and disrupts the intended logic of the function.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns `''.join(unique_chars)`, which is a string of unique characters in the order they were processed. This is not the decoded string but rather a list of unique characters, which is not the expected output.

To correctly decode the string, the function should:
- Construct the `unique_chars` list as described.
- Create a mapping from each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric counterpart.
- Replace each character in the input string `s` using this mapping.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-1 - i] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

Given the issues in the provided implementation, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
