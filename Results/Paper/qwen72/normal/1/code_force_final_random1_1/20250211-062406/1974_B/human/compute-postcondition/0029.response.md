Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string containing all unique characters from `s` in the order they were first encountered. The returned string includes any characters that were not initially in the set of unique characters but were added during the function's execution. The original string `s` is modified during the function's execution, but the final state of `s` is not relevant to the function's output. The function ensures that the returned string contains each unique character exactly once, maintaining their first occurrence order. **
