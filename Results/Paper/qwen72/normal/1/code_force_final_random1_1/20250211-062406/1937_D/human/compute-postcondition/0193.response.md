Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 2, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, `b` is equal to `A[l - 1]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `b` is updated to be the value of `A[l - 1]`. Since `l` is 0, `l - 1` is -1, so `b` is now equal to the last element of the list `A`. All other variables remain unchanged.
