Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is `n - 2`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i]`, and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0]`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not `<`, there are no changes to `idx_B` or `B`.***
