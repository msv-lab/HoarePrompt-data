The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (to 1), and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, and `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists. `n` is greater than 1. If `s[i]` is '>', `l` is 1, `r` is the length of `B`, and the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions described in the if part. If `s[i]` is not '>', `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, and the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions described in the else part.**
