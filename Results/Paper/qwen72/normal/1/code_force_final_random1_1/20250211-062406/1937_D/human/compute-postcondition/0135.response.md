Postcondition: ***`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, and `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists. `n` is greater than 1. If `r` is 0, and `s[i]` is '>', `l` is 1, `r` is the length of `B`, and the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions described in the if part. If `r` is 0 and `s[i]` is not '>', `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, and the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions described in the else part. If `r` is not 0, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `b` is `b + (1 - idx_A[-1]) * r`.***
