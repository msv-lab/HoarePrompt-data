Let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `j` will be equal to `n`.
- `i` will be 0.
- `idx_B` will contain the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order.
- `B` will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop.
- If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- The character at index `i` of the string `s` is not '>'.
- Additionally, `l` is 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(i + 1, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- The print statement will add 1 to `i` and print the result.
- Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` will be 1.
- The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space rather than a newline.

### Output:
Output: **1 **

This means that the number 1 will be printed followed by a space.
