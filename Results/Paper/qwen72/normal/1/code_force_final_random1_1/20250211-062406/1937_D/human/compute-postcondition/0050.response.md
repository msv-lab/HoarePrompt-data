Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n - 3`, if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i]`, and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0]`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not `<`, there are no changes to `idx_B` or `B`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is updated to `n - 1 - j`.
- Given `j` is 2, `i` becomes `n - 1 - 2`, which simplifies to `n - 3`.
- The conditions regarding `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged, as they depend on the character at the new index `i` in the string `s`. If the character at index `i` (which is now `n - 3`) is `<`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i]`, and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0]`. If the character at index `i` is not `<`, there are no changes to `idx_B` or `B`.
