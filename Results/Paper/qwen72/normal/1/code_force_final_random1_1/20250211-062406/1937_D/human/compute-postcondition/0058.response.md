Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n`, `i` will be `-1`, `idx_B` will contain the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, and `B` will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists. `l` is 0.**
