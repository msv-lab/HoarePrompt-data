Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` will be equal to `n`, `i` will be `-1`, `idx_B` will contain the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists. `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if l < r:
            a = A[l]
            x = r - (l + 2)
            b = B[r - 1]
            if x >= 0:
                b = b - B[x]
                b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
            b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 1]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1
        if l <= r:
            if l == 0:
                print(i + 1, end=' ')
            else:
                a = A[l - 1]
                a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l
                b = B[r]
                if r - l >= 0:
                    b = b - B[r - l]
                    b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)
                b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l
                print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r]
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r - 1 > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 2]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 0, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, and `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists. `n` is greater than 0. If `s[i]` is '>', `l` is 1, `r` is the length of `B`, and the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions described in the if part. If `s[i]` is not '>', `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, and the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions described in the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, and `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If `s[i]` is '>', `l` is incremented by 1, `r` remains unchanged, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `s[i]` is not '>', `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1. If `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `l` is 0, the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions described in the if part. If `l` is 1, `a` is set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `l` is greater than `r` and `r` is 0, the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions described in the else part. Otherwise, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, and `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If `s[i]` is '>', `l` is incremented by 1, `r` remains 0, and `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions described in the else part. If `s[i]` is not '>', `l` is set to 0, `r` is set to the length of `B` minus 2. If `l` is 0, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `l` is greater than 0, `a` is updated to `A[-1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is updated to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `r` is 0, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `r` is greater than 0, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
