Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, the length of the list `idx_B` is 0, `B` is a list containing `[0]`.**

The code appends the value `0` to the list `B`. The initial state remains unchanged except for the list `B`, which now contains a single element `0`.
