Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution is complex and attempts to precompute certain values to optimize the calculation of the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid. However, upon closer inspection, the logic for calculating the time taken seems to be overly complicated and prone to errors. Specifically, the way the `A` and `B` arrays are used and the conditions under which they are updated do not seem to align with the straightforward movement and inversion rules described in the problem statement.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the following input:

```
1
3
>><
```

Expected Output:
```
3 4 1
```

Actual Output:
The actual output from the provided program does not match the expected output. The program's logic for handling the movement and inversion of the pinball is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

This example demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, hence the correctness is **False**.
