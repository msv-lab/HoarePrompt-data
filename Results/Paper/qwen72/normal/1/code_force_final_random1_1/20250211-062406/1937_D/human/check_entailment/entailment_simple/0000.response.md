### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(s)` is defined to handle the logic for each test case. This function calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

3. **Initialization**: Two lists, `A` and `B`, are initialized to store the cumulative distances for '>' and '<' characters, respectively. Two additional lists, `idx_A` and `idx_B`, are used to store the indices of these characters.

4. **First Loop (Handling '>')**:
   - The loop iterates through the string `s` and updates the lists `A` and `idx_A` for each occurrence of '>'.
   - The value `x` is calculated based on the previous values in `A` and the distance between the current index and the last index of '>'.
   - This ensures that the cumulative distance for each '>' is correctly computed.

5. **Second Loop (Handling '<')**:
   - The loop iterates through the string `s` in reverse and updates the lists `B` and `idx_B` for each occurrence of '<'.
   - Similar to the first loop, the value `x` is calculated based on the previous values in `B` and the distance between the current index and the last index of '<'.
   - This ensures that the cumulative distance for each '<' is correctly computed.

6. **Final Calculation**:
   - The program then iterates through the string `s` again to compute the final time for each cell.
   - Depending on whether the current character is '>' or '<', different calculations are performed to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The program handles edge cases where there are no '>' or '<' characters in the string.

7. **Output**: The results are printed for each cell in the format specified in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output formats correctly, and the calculations for the pinball's movement and the time it takes to leave the grid are consistent with the rules provided.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
