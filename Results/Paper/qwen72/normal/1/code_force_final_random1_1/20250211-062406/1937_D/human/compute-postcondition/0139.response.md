Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to 1.
- The `print` statement is `print(i + 1, end=' ')`.

Let's break down the execution of the `print` statement:

1. The expression `i + 1` is evaluated.
   - Since `i` is 1, `i + 1` evaluates to `1 + 1`, which is 2.
2. The `print` statement then outputs the value 2, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **2 **
