The code snippet `B.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the list `B`. Given the initial state, `x` is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1)) * len(idx_B)`. After appending `x` to `B`, the length of `B` increases by 1, and the last element of `B` is now `x`.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, `idx_B` is not empty, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1)) * len(idx_B)`, `B` is a list with one additional element `x` appended to it.**
