Postcondition: ***`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 0, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, and `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` remain empty lists. `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of the string `s` is not '>'. Additionally, `l` is not equal to 0. `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. If `r - l >= 0`, `b` is equal to the last element of `B` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`. If `r - l < 0`, `b` remains equal to the last element of `B`.***
