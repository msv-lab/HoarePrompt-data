Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `A` is [0], `idx_A` is either an empty list or contains `[0]` depending on whether the first character of `s` is '>' or not.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` must be greater than 1.
- The initial state also specifies that `i` is 1.
- If the first character of `s` is '>', then `idx_A` is a list containing `[0]`.
- If `len(idx_A) == 0`, then `A` is [0] and `idx_A` remains an empty list.
- Otherwise, `A` is a list containing one element `[x]`, `idx_A` is not empty, and `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 1] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
- The code `A.append(0)` adds the value 0 to the list `A`.

Therefore, after executing the code:
- If the first character of `s` is '>', `A` becomes [0] and `idx_A` remains `[0]`.
- If the first character of `s` is not '>', `A` becomes [0] and `idx_A` remains an empty list.

Thus, the output state is: `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `A` is [0], and `idx_A` is either an empty list or contains `[0]` depending on whether the first character of `s` is '>' or not.
