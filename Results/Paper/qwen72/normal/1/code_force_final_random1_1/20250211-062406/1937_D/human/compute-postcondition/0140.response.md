Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '>' or not, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `a` is equal to `A[l - 1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `a` is updated to `A[l - 1]`. Since `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '>' or not, and `i` is 1, `l` could be 0 or 1. If `l` is 1, `a` is set to `A[0]`. If `l` is 0, `a` is set to `A[-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
