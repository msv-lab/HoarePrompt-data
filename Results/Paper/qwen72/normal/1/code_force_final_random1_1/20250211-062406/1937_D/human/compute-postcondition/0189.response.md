To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation step by step:

### Initial State:
- `j` is equal to `n`.
- `i` is 2.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order.
- `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 2.
- `a` is `A[-1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Understanding `a` and `b`:**
   - `a` is calculated as `A[-1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
     - `A[-1]` is the last element of the list `A`.
     - `idx_A[l - 1]` is the element at index `l - 1` in the list `idx_A`.
     - Since `l` is 0, `l - 1` is -1, which means `idx_A[l - 1]` is the last element of `idx_A`.
     - Therefore, `a = A[-1] + (2 - idx_A[-1]) * 0 = A[-1]`.
   - `b` is calculated as `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
     - `r` is `len(B) - 2`.
     - `r - l` is `len(B) - 2` since `l` is 0.
     - `B[r]` is the element at index `r` in the list `B`.
     - `B[r - l]` is the element at index `r` in the list `B` (same as `B[r]`).
     - `idx_B[r - l]` is the element at index `r` in the list `idx_B`.
     - `idx_B[r]` is the element at index `r` in the list `idx_B` (same as `idx_B[r - l]`).
     - Therefore, `b = B[r] - B[r] - (idx_B[r] - i) * (r) + (idx_B[r] - i) * 0 = 0`.

2. **Calculating the Expression in the `print` Statement:**
   - The expression is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.
   - Substituting the values:
     - `a * 2` is `A[-1] * 2`.
     - `b * 2` is `0 * 2 = 0`.
     - `i` is 2.
     - `1` is 1.
   - Therefore, the expression becomes `A[-1] * 2 + 0 + 2 + 1 = A[-1] * 2 + 3`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print the value of `A[-1] * 2 + 3` followed by a space.

Output: **A[-1] * 2 + 3 (where A[-1] is the last element of the list A)**
