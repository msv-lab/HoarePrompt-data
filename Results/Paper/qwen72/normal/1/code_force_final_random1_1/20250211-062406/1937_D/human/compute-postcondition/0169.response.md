To determine what will be printed by the `print(n - i, end=' ')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `j` is equal to `n`.
- `i` is 2.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order.
- `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop.

### Code Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify the Value of `i`**:
   - According to the initial state, `i` is 2.

2. **Identify the Value of `n`**:
   - The initial state mentions that `j` is equal to `n`, but it does not explicitly provide the value of `n`. However, since `i` is 2, and the `print` statement involves `n - i`, we need to know the value of `n`.

3. **Calculate `n - i`**:
   - Since `i` is 2, the expression `n - i` simplifies to `n - 2`.

4. **Determine the Output**:
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `n - 2` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Final Output:
Since the exact value of `n` is not provided in the initial state, we can only express the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **n - 2**
