To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `j` is equal to `n`.
- `i` is 1.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order.
- `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop.
- If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- If `s[i]` is '>', `l` is 1, `r` is the length of `B`, and the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions described in the if part.
- If `s[i]` is not '>', `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, and the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions described in the else part.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is initialized to 1.
- The variable `n` is greater than 1.
- The expression `n - i` will be evaluated as `n - 1`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the value of `n - 1` followed by a space (since `end=' '`).

Output: **n - 1 (where n is the value of n and i is 1)**
