To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `j` is equal to `n`.
- `i` is 2.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order.
- `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 1.
- `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
- `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

### Variables Involved:
- `a`: This is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
- `b`: This is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
- `n`: This is the value of `j`.
- `i`: This is 2.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `a`**:
   - `r` is the length of `B` minus 1.
   - `B[r - 1]` is the second-to-last element of `B`.
   - `idx_B[r - 1]` is the second-to-last index of `<` in `s`.
   - `a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.

2. **Update `b`**:
   - `b` is initially some value (not specified in the initial state).
   - `idx_A[l - 1]` is the element at index `l - 1` in `idx_A` (assuming `idx_A` is defined and `l` is greater than 0).
   - `b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

3. **Calculate the expression in the `print` statement**:
   - The expression is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`.
   - Substitute the values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i` into the expression.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `B`, `idx_B`, `idx_A`, and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * r) * 2 + (b + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r) * 2 + (n - 2)**

This is the most precise description of the output based on the given initial state.
