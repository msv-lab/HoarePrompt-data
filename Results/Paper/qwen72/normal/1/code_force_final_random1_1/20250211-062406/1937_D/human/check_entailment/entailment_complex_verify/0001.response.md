### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave a grid of length `n` with characters `<` and `>`.
   - The pinball moves left or right based on the character and inverts the character after moving.
   - The goal is to compute the time for each starting cell.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It calls the function `func_1(s)` to compute the results.
   - The results are printed for each test case.

3. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - Two lists `A` and `B` are initialized to store cumulative values.
     - Two lists `idx_A` and `idx_B` are initialized to store indices of `>` and `<` respectively.
   - **Forward Pass**:
     - For each cell `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `s[i]` is `>`, it calculates the cumulative value and appends it to `A` and `idx_A`.
   - **Backward Pass**:
     - For each cell `i` from `n-1` to 0, if `s[i]` is `<`, it calculates the cumulative value and appends it to `B` and `idx_B`.
   - **Result Calculation**:
     - For each cell `i` from 0 to `n-1`, it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the cumulative values in `A` and `B`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the forward and backward passes to precompute the necessary values.
   - The result calculation for each cell is based on the precomputed values, which should accurately reflect the movement of the pinball.
   - The logic for handling different cases (when `l < r`, `r == 0`, etc.) seems to cover all possible scenarios.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases where the grid is entirely `<` or `>`.
   - It should also handle cases where the grid is a mix of `<` and `>`.

6. **Performance**:
   - The program uses linear time complexity for both the forward and backward passes, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Forward Pass**:
  - The loop iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
  - It identifies the positions of `>` and calculates the cumulative values.
  - The cumulative values are stored in `A` and the indices in `idx_A`.

- **Backward Pass**:
  - The loop iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
  - It identifies the positions of `<` and calculates the cumulative values.
  - The cumulative values are stored in `B` and the indices in `idx_B`.

- **Result Calculation**:
  - The program iterates through each cell `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
  - Depending on whether the cell contains `>` or `<`, it uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
  - The logic for handling different cases (when `l < r`, `r == 0`, etc.) is complex but seems to cover all possible scenarios.

### Conclusion:
After a detailed analysis of the program, its logic, and the annotated code, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The precomputation and result calculation steps are well-structured and should handle all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
