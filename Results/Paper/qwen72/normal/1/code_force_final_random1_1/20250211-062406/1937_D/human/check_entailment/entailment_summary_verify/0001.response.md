### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a one-dimensional grid with characters `<` and `>`.
   - A pinball starts at a cell and moves left or right based on the character.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.
   - We need to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting cell.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It calls the function `func_1(s)` to compute the results.
   - The results are printed for each test case.

3. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - Two lists `A` and `B` are initialized to store cumulative values.
     - Two lists `idx_A` and `idx_B` are initialized to store indices of `>` and `<` respectively.
   - **Forward Pass**:
     - For each cell `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `s[i]` is `>`, it calculates the cumulative value and appends it to `A` and `idx_A`.
   - **Backward Pass**:
     - For each cell `i` from `n-1` to 0, if `s[i]` is `<`, it calculates the cumulative value and appends it to `B` and `idx_B`.
   - **Result Calculation**:
     - For each cell `i` from 0 to `n-1`, it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the cumulative values in `A` and `B`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the forward and backward passes to precompute the necessary values.
   - The result calculation for each cell is based on the precomputed values, which should accurately reflect the movement of the pinball.
   - The logic for handling different cases (when `l < r`, `r == 0`, etc.) seems to cover all possible scenarios.
   - The function `func_1` directly prints the results, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases where the grid is entirely `<` or `>`.
   - It should also handle cases where the grid is a mix of `<` and `>`.
   - The provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the program.

6. **Performance**:
   - The program uses linear time complexity for both the forward and backward passes, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the program and its logic, it appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The precomputation and result calculation steps are well-structured and should handle all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
