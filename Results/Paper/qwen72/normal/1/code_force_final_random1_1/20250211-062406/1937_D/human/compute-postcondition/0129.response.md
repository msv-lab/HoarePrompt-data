Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to the variable `b`.
- Since `l` is 0, `l - 1` is -1, which means `b` is assigned the value of the last element in the list `A`.
- All other variables (`j`, `i`, `idx_B`, `B`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
