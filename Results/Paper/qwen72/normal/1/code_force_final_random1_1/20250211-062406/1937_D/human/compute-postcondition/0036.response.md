The code snippet assigns a value to the variable `x`. To determine this value, we need to evaluate the expression `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`.

- `B[len(B) - 1]`: This accesses the last element of the list `B`.
- `idx_B[len(B) - 1]`: This accesses the element in `idx_B` at the same index as the last element of `B`.
- `(idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`: This calculates the difference between the accessed element in `idx_B` and `i`, multiplies it by the length of `idx_B`.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- The character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`
- `idx_B` is not empty

Let's assume:
- `B` is a list with at least one element.
- `idx_B` is a list with at least one element.

The value of `x` is calculated as follows:
- `B[len(B) - 1]` is the last element of `B`.
- `idx_B[len(B) - 1]` is the element in `idx_B` at the same index as the last element of `B`.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `len(idx_B)` is the length of `idx_B`.

Thus, `x` is calculated as:
\[ x = B[\text{last index}] + (\text{idx\_B}[\text{last index}] - (n - 1)) \times \text{len(idx\_B)} \]

Since the exact values of `B` and `idx_B` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `x`. However, we can express it in terms of the given variables.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, `idx_B` is not empty, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1)) * len(idx_B)`**.
