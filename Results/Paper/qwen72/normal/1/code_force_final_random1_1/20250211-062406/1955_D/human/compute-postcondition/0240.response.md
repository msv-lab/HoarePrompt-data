Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `m` is the length of the list `b`, `k` remains an input integer, `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from the input. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains 2 or 3 (depending on its initial value), and `cnt_b` and `curr` remain unchanged based on the conditions described.***
