Output State: **`i` is `n - m - 1`, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` is the length of the list `b`, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, `b` remains a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is the final number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative, `b_values` must have at least one element, `cnt_b[n - m - 1]` is 0.**
