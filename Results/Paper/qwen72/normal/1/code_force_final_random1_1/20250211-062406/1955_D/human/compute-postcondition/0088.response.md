The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `b`.

Given the initial state:
- All elements in `b_values` have been processed, and `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for every `i` in `b_values`.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

After executing the code:
- The list `b` is now populated with the integers read from the input.

The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, and `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for every `i` in `b_values`. `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
