To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `i` and the object `b_values`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in b_values:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute, `b_values` must contain at least one element. The variable `i` will take on the values of the elements in `b_values` during each iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `b_values` is not empty. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `cnt_b`, `curr`, `ans`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` is an element of `b_values`**
