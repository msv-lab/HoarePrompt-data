The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `b_values`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `b_values`. For the loop to execute again, `b_values` must contain at least two elements, and `i` should be set to the next element in `b_values`.

At the end of the last iteration, `b_values` must contain at least one element, and `cnt_b[i]` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `b_values` must contain at least two elements, and `i` should be the second element in `b_values`.

State: **`b_values` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0**
