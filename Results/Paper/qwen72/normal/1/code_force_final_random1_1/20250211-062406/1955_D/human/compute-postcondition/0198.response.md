Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `ans` is 0, `n` remains an input integer, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, `b` remains a list of integers read from the input. If `a[2]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[2]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is not modified and `curr` remains unchanged.***
