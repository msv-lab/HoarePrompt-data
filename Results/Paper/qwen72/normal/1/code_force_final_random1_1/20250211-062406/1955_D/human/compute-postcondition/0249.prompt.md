Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - m - 1`, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` is the length of the list `b`, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, `b` remains a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is the final number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative. For each element `x` in `a` that is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[x]` is decremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a` up to the point where `cnt_b[x]` becomes negative. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by the number of times the condition `curr >= k` was true during the loop's execution.
Code of the loop:
for i in b_values:
    cnt_b[i] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n - m - 1`, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` is the length of the list `b`, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, `b` remains a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is the final number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative, `b_values` must have at least one element, `cnt_b[n - m - 1]` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is the next element in `b_values`, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` is the length of the list `b`, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, `b` remains a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is the final number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative, `b_values` must have at least one element, `cnt_b[n - m - 1]` is 0, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the next (second) element in `b_values`, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` is the length of the list `b`, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, `b` remains a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is the final number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative, `b_values` must have at least two elements, `cnt_b[n - m - 1]` is 0, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
