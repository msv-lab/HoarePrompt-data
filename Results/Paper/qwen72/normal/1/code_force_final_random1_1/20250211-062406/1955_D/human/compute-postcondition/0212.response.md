Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than `m`, `m` is the length of the list `b`, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, `b` remains a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative. If `a[0]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[0]]` is incremented by 1. If the count of `a[0]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1; otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `a[0]` is not in `b_values`, `curr` and `ans` remain unchanged. Additionally, `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and the current value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0.**
