Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than `m`, `m` is the length of the list `b`, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, `b` remains a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative. `cnt_b[a[0]]` is incremented by 1. If `a[0]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[0]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is further decremented by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 2. If `curr` is less than `k`, `ans` is set to 1. If `a[0]` is not in `b_values`, `curr` and `ans` remain unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1.***
