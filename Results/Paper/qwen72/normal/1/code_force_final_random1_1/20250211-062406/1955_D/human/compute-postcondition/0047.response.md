Output State: **`n` is greater than `m`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations plus 1, the element `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `curr` is decremented by 1, and if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1; otherwise, `ans` remains 0. Additionally, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0.**
