The code snippet `cnt_b[i] = 0` assigns the value 0 to the element in the list `cnt_b` at the index `i`. Since `i` is the third element in `b_values`, and `cnt_b[i]` was already 0, the assignment does not change the value of `cnt_b[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`b_values` must contain at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0**.
