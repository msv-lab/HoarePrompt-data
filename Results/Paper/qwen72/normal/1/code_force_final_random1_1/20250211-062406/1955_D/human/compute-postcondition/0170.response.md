The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in a list called `a`.

Given the initial state:
- All elements in `b_values` have been processed, and for each element `i` in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.

After executing the code, the variable `a` is updated to contain the list of integers read from the input. The other variables (`b_values`, `cnt_b`, `n`, `m`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, and for each element `i` in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
