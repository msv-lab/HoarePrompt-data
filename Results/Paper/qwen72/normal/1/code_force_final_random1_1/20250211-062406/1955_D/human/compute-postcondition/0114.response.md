Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is decreased by 1. If `a[1]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decreased by 1. If `cnt_b[a[1]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is 2. If `cnt_b[a[1]]` is less than 0, `curr` remains 0. If `a[1]` is not in `b_values`, `curr` remains 0. If `cnt_b[a[2]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is 2. If `cnt_b[a[2]]` is less than 0, `curr` remains 0.***
