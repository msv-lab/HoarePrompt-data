The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` after converting them to integers. The initial condition specifies that `int(input())` must be greater than 0, but this condition does not directly affect the current code snippet.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from input, and each must be greater than 0.**
