The code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b` at the key `a[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is 0, the element at index 0 of the list `a` is in the set `b_values`, and `b_values` contains unique elements from the list `b`, the value of `cnt_b` at the key corresponding to the first element of `a` is decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0, the element at index 0 of the list `a` is in the set `b_values`, and `cnt_b[a[0]]` is decreased by 1.**
