The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements of `b_values`. Therefore, we can only adjust the state of `i` based on the elements of `b_values`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `n - m - 1`, and `b_values` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must take the next value from `b_values`.

Since `i` is iterating over the elements of `b_values`, and the current value of `i` is `n - m - 1`, the next value of `i` will be the next element in `b_values`. However, we don't know the exact value of the next element in `b_values` without additional information about the contents of `b_values`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the next element in `b_values`.

State: **`i` is the next element in `b_values`, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` is the length of the list `b`, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, `b` remains a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is the final number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative, `b_values` must have at least one element, `cnt_b[n - m - 1]` is 0**
