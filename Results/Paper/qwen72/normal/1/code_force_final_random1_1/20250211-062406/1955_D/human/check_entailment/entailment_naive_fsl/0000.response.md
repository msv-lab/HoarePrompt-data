Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle the case where the frequency of an element in `b` is greater than 1. Specifically, the logic for updating `curr` and `cnt_b` does not correctly account for the frequency of elements in `b`.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5 3 2
1 2 3 2 1
2 2 3
```
Expected Output:
```
3
```
Actual Output:
```
2
```

In this test case, the array `b` contains the element `2` twice. The program incorrectly updates the `curr` value when it encounters the element `2` in the sliding window, leading to an incorrect count of good subsegments.

To fix this issue, the program needs to correctly manage the frequency of elements in `b` and ensure that the `curr` value is updated accurately based on these frequencies.
