Output State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for every `i` in `b_values` except for `cnt_b[b[0]]` which is 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` which is 1, and `cnt_b[b[2]]` which is now 1. `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2.**
