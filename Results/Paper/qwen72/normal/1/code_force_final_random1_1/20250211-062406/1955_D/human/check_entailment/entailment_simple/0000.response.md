Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The function correctly initializes `cnt_b` as a list of zeros with a size of `max_val + 1` to handle the maximum possible value in the arrays. It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Counting Elements in `b`**: For each test case, the function reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then reads the arrays `a` and `b`. It correctly counts the occurrences of each element in `b` using `cnt_b`.

3. **Initial Subarray Check**: The function initializes `curr` to 0 and iterates through the first `m` elements of `a`. If an element in `a` is in `b_values` (a set of elements in `b`), it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count remains non-negative. This correctly sets up the initial count of matching elements for the first subarray.

4. **Sliding Window Mechanism**: The function uses a sliding window approach to check each subsequent subarray of length `m` in `a`. It updates the count `curr` by adjusting the counts in `cnt_b` for the element being removed from the window (`a[i]`) and the element being added to the window (`a[i + m]`). This ensures that `curr` always reflects the number of matching elements in the current subarray.

5. **Counting Good Subarrays**: The function increments `ans` whenever `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, indicating that the current subarray is good.

6. **Resetting Counts**: After processing each test case, the function resets the counts in `cnt_b` for all elements in `b_values` to ensure that the next test case starts with a clean slate.

7. **Output**: The function prints the number of good subarrays for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
