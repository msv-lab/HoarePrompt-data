The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `b_values`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `b_values`. If `b_values` has at least three elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `b_values` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `b_values`, and `cnt_b[i]` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `b_values` must have at least three elements, and `i` will be the third element in `b_values`.

State: **`b_values` must contain at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0**
