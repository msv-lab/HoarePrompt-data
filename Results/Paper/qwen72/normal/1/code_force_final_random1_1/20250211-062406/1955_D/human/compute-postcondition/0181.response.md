Output State: **All elements in `b_values` are unique and represent the distinct elements from the list `b`. `cnt_b[i]` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `b` for each element `i` in `b_values`. The variable `n` remains an input integer, `m` is the length of the list `b`, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, `b` remains a list of integers read from the input, and the loop index `i` is `m-1`. `ans` is 0. `curr` is 0.**
