Output State: **`i` is the next element in `b_values`, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` is the length of the list `b`, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, `b` remains a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is the final number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative, `b_values` must have at least one element, `cnt_b[n - m - 1]` is 0, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `cnt_b[i] = 0` sets the value of `cnt_b` at index `i` to 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
- The specific value of `cnt_b[i]` is now 0, which is explicitly stated in the output state.
