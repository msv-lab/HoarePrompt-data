The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` updates the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by decrementing it by 1. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `b_values`, `curr`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than `m`.
- `i` is 0.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `k` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `b` is a list of integers.
- `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.
- `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`.
- `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations.
- The element `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`.
- If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `curr` is decremented by 1, and if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
- If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, `ans` remains 0.

After executing the code snippet:
- `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1.
- Since `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is now one less than its previous value.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than `m`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations, the element `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `curr` is decremented by 1, and if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1; otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, `ans` remains 0.**
