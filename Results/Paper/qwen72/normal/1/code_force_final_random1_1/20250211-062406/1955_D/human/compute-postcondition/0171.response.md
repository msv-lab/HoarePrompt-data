Output State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, and for each element `i` in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**

Explanation:
- The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `b`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The condition that all elements in `b_values` have been processed and `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for each element `i` in `b_values` remains valid.
- The new list `b` contains the integers read from the input.
