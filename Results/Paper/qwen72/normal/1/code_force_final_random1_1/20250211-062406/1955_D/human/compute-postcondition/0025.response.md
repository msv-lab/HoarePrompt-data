Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1`, if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 then `curr` is 2, otherwise `curr` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. Initially, `curr` was either 1 or 0 based on the condition `if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0`. After the increment, if `cnt_b[a[i]]` was greater than or equal to 0, `curr` becomes 2. Otherwise, if `cnt_b[a[i]]` was less than 0, `curr` becomes 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
