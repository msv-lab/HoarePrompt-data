Output State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for every `i` in `b_values` except for each `cnt_b[b[j]]` where `j` ranges from 0 to `m-1`, which are incremented by 1. `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `i` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 0.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `cnt_b` array will have counted the occurrences of each element in the `b` list. Specifically, for each index `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, the value `cnt_b[b[j]]` will be incremented by 1. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state, and the lists `a` and `b` also remain unchanged. The loop variable `i` will be equal to `m-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
