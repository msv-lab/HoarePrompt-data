Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All elements in `b_values` are unique and represent the distinct elements from the list `b`. `cnt_b[i]` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `b` for each element `i` in `b_values`. The variable `n` remains an input integer, `m` is the length of the list `b`, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, `b` remains a list of integers read from the input, and the loop index `i` is `m-1`. `ans` is 0. `curr` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
            curr += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 1 if `a[0]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[0]]` is greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, `curr` remains 0. All elements in `b_values` are unique and represent the distinct elements from the list `b`. `cnt_b[i]` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `b` for each element `i` in `b_values`, except for `a[0]` which is now one less if `a[0]` is in `b_values`. `n` remains an input integer, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, and `b` remains a list of integers read from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `ans` is 0. If `a[0]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[0]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `curr` is 2 if `a[1]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[1]]` is greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, `curr` is 1. If `a[1]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decremented by 1. `n` remains an input integer, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, and `b` remains a list of integers read from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `ans` is 0, `n` remains an input integer, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, `b` remains a list of integers read from the input. If `a[2]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[2]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is not modified and `curr` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
