Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `ans` contains the total number of valid subarrays of length `m` in `a` where at least `k` elements match elements in `b` and their counts in `cnt_b` are non-negative. The list `cnt_b` is reset to zero for all elements in `b_values`. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their initial values. The variable `curr` is the final count of elements in the last subarray of `a` that are in `b_values` and have non-negative counts in `cnt_b`.**
