The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'` to the console. The initial state provides details about variables like `t`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the content of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Output: **YES**
