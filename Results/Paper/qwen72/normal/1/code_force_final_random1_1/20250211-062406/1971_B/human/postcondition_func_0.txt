The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. It checks if the string `s` contains exactly two unique characters. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by either the string `s` sorted in descending order (if `s` is already sorted in ascending order) or the string `s` sorted in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.
