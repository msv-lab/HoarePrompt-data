You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        score = 0
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        print(score)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, representing the numbers written on the whiteboard.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        
        score = 0
        
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        
        print(score)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the final input, `score` is the sum of every second element starting from the first element in `l` up to the last even-indexed element within the range of `2 * n`, `i` is `2 * n`, and `2 * n` is greater than 0. The loop has completed all its iterations for all `t` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `2n` integers. The function calculates the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair of consecutive integers from the sorted list and prints this sum for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state includes the printed scores for each test case, and the input variables are no longer needed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the score by selecting pairs of numbers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score.
   - The goal is to ensure that we always pick the smallest possible number in each pair to maximize the overall score.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - It sorts the list of integers. Sorting ensures that the smallest numbers are considered first, which is crucial for maximizing the score.
   - The program then iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element starting from the first (index 0). This is because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements will be at even indices when considering pairs.
   - The sum of these elements (which are the minimums of the pairs) is added to the score.
   - Finally, the score is printed for each test case.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **Sorting**: Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are considered first, which is necessary for maximizing the score.
   - **Pair Selection**: By iterating through the sorted list and taking every second element, the program correctly selects the minimum of each pair.
   - **Score Calculation**: The score is calculated by summing the selected elements, which are the minimums of the pairs.
   - **Test Cases**: The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop to process each test case independently.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the smallest possible input (n=1) correctly.
   - It also handles larger inputs (up to the constraints) correctly by sorting and selecting the appropriate elements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It sorts the list, selects the minimums of the pairs, and calculates the score accurately.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
