The code snippet `score += l[i]` updates the value of `score` by adding the value of the element at index `i` in the list `l` to the current value of `score`. Given the initial state, let's determine the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` remains an input integer greater than 0.
- `l` remains a sorted list of integers from the new input.
- `score` was initially `l[2 * n - 2] + l[2 * n]`.
- `i` is `2 * n + 2`.

The code updates `score` to be `l[2 * n - 2] + l[2 * n] + l[2 * n + 2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is `l[2 * n - 2] + l[2 * n] + l[2 * n + 2]`, `i` is `2 * n + 2`, and `2 * n` is greater than 0.**
