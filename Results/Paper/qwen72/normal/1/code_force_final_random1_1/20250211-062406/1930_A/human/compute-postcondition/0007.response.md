The value of `score` is updated by adding the third element of the list `l` (since `i` is 2, and list indices start at 0). The initial value of `score` was the first element of `l`. After the addition, `score` is now equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `score` is now equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `l`, `i` is 2.**
