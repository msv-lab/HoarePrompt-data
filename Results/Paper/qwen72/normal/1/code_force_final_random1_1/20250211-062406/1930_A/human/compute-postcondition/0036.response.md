To determine what will be printed by the `print(score)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input.
   - `score` is the sum of every second element starting from the first element of `l` up to the last even-indexed element within the range of `2 * n`.
   - `i` is `2 * n`, and `2 * n` is greater than 0.

2. **Understanding the Calculation of `score`:**
   - The list `l` is sorted.
   - We need to sum every second element starting from the first element of `l` up to the last even-indexed element within the range of `2 * n`.
   - This means we sum elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to the largest even index less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `n = 3`, then `2 * n = 6`.
   - If `l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, the even-indexed elements within the range of 6 are at indices 0, 2, 4.
   - The elements at these indices are `1`, `3`, and `5`.
   - Therefore, `score = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.

4. **General Case:**
   - For any given `n`, the elements to be summed are those at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to the largest even index less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`.
   - The exact value of `score` depends on the specific values in the list `l`.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(score)` statement will print the sum of the specified elements in the list `l`.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be the sum of every second element starting from the first element of `l` up to the last even-indexed element within the range of `2 * n`.

Output: **score (where score is the sum of every second element starting from the first element of l up to the last even-indexed element within the range of 2 * n)**
