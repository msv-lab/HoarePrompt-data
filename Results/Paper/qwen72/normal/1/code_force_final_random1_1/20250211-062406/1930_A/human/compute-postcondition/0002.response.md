The code `l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and then sorts the resulting list of integers.

- `t` remains unchanged as an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` remains unchanged as an input integer greater than 0.
- A new variable `l` is created and assigned the sorted list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input.**
