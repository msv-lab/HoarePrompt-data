The code snippet `score += l[i]` updates the value of `score` by adding the value of the element at index `i` in the list `l`. Given the initial state, `i` is `2 * n + 2`, and `score` is initially `l[2 * n - 2] + l[2 * n]`.

Let's break down the changes:

- `score` is updated to `l[2 * n - 2] + l[2 * n] + l[2 * n + 2]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is `l[2 * n - 2] + l[2 * n] + l[2 * n + 2]`, `i` is `2 * n + 2`, and `2 * n` is greater than 0.**
