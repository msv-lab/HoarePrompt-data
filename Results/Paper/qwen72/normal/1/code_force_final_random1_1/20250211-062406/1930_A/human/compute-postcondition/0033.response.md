The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `n`, and the expression `2 * n`. The loop increments `i` by 2 each iteration and continues as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `2 * n` must be greater than 2

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 2, making it 4. For the loop condition to still hold (`i < 2 * n`), `2 * n` must be greater than 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is now equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `l`, `i` is 4, and `2 * n` must be greater than 4**
