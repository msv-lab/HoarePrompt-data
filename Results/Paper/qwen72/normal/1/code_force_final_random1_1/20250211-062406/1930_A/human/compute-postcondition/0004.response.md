To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and the expression `2 * n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the range `range(0, 2 * n, 2)` is non-empty. This means that the upper bound `2 * n` must be greater than the lower bound `0`.
3. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000 (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
   - `score` is 0 (not directly relevant to the loop execution).

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will start at 0.
- **`n`**: Since `n` is already specified to be greater than 0, it ensures that `2 * n` will be greater than 0, making the range non-empty.

### Final State:
The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, and `i` will start at 0. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `score` is 0, `i` is 0**
