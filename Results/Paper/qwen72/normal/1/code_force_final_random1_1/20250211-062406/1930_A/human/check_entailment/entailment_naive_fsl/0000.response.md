Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the score by always selecting the smallest available number in each move. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Sorting the List**: The program starts by sorting the list of numbers. This ensures that the smallest numbers are always at the beginning of the list.

2. **Iterating and Summing**: The program iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, summing up the elements at even indices. This is because, in a sorted list, the smallest number in each pair will always be at the even index (0, 2, 4, ...).

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to read the number of test cases and process each one individually.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as:
   - When `n` is 1 (only one pair of numbers).
   - When all numbers are the same.
   - When the numbers are in a random order.

Given these points, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly and follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
