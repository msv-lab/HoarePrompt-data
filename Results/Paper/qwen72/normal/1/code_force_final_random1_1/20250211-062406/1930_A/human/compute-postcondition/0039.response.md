Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `2n` integers. The function calculates the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair of consecutive integers from the sorted list and prints this sum for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state includes the printed scores for each test case, and the input variables are no longer needed. **
