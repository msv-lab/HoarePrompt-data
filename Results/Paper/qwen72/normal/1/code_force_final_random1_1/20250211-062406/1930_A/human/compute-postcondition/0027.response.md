Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is the sum of every second element in `l` starting from index 0 up to the last even-indexed element within the range of `2 * n`, `i` is `2 * n`, and `2 * n` is greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))` updates the variable `l` to be a sorted list of integers from the new input.
- The initial state specifies that `l` was already a sorted list of integers from a new input, so the value of `l` remains a sorted list of integers from the new input.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `score`, `i`, and `2 * n`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the updated value of `l`.
