The function `func_13` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, where `b` is not zero. It returns a tuple of three elements. If `b` is zero, it returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively computes and returns a tuple where the first element is the second element from a recursive call to `func_13(b, a % b)`, the second element is the result of `x - a // b * y` (where `x` and `y` are the first and second elements from the recursive call), and the third element is the third element from the recursive call. The function effectively computes values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, though the specific relationship is not explicitly stated.
