Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, `2 ≤ k ≤ n`, `b` is the binary string of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)` followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then continues with `2^i` for each `i` from `lk` to `l-1`, `i` is `l-1`, `l` is the length of `b`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop starts with `i` initialized to `lk - 2`.
- The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `l`.
- In each iteration, `2 ** i` is appended to the `ans` list, and `i` is incremented by 1.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `l-1` (since the loop stops when `i` is no longer less than `l`).
- The `ans` list will contain all the elements it had initially, plus the additional elements `2^i` for each `i` from `lk` to `l-1`.

Thus, the final state of `ans` will include all the initial elements followed by the powers of 2 from `2^lk` to `2^(l-1)`.
