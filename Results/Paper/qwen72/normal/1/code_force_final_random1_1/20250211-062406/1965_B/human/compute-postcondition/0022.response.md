Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, `2 ≤ k ≤ n`, `b` is the binary string of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing `[1, 2]`, `lk` is the length of `bk`, `i` is 1, `lk` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value `2 ** i` to the list `ans`.
- Since `i` is 1, `2 ** i` evaluates to `2`.
- Therefore, `ans` changes from `[1]` to `[1, 2]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, `2 ≤ k ≤ n`, `k` is not equal to 1, and `lk` must be greater than 2 are still valid.
