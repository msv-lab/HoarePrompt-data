Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, `b` is the binary string of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b` and must be greater than 3, `k` is currently equal to the value returned by `func_7()` for `k`, `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`, `i` is 3**. 

Explanation: The code `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 3, `2 ** 3` equals 8, so 8 is appended to `ans`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
