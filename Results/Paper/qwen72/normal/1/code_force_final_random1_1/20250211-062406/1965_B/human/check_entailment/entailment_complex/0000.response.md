### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_14()` to process the input and generate the required sequence.

2. **Function `func_14`**:
   - This function reads two integers, `n` and `k`, using `func_7()`.
   - It then constructs a sequence `ans` based on the values of `n` and `k`:
     - If `k == 1`:
       - If `n == 2`, it returns the string `'1\n2'`.
       - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence of powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(l-1)`, where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
     - If `k != 1`:
       - It constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then continues with `2^i` for each `i` from `lk` to `l-1`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.

3. **Output**:
   - The sequence `ans` is converted to a space-separated string and printed for each test case.

### Verification of Conditions:
- **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
  - For `k == 1`, the sequence is constructed to avoid any subsequence summing to 1.
  - For `k != 1`, the sequence is constructed to avoid any subsequence summing to `k` by carefully choosing elements that do not allow such a sum.

- **Subsequences Summing to All Other Values**:
  - The sequence is constructed to ensure that all values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by some subsequence of the sequence.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, constructs the sequence according to the problem requirements, and ensures that the conditions are met. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
