### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires generating a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - For all values `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`), there should be a subsequence that sums to `v`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_14**: This function is responsible for generating the required sequence based on the given `n` and `k`.
     - **Special Case Handling**:
       - When `k == 1`, the function handles the edge case where `n == 2` separately by returning the string '1\n2'.
       - For other values of `n` when `k == 1`, it constructs a list `ans` containing powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(l-1)`, where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
     - **General Case Handling**:
       - For `k > 1`, the function constructs the sequence by including powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
       - It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum condition is met.
       - Additional values like `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` are added to cover the remaining range.
       - The function also appends powers of 2 from `2^lk` to `2^(l-1)` to ensure the sequence covers all values up to `n`.

3. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is constructed to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while covering all other values from 1 to `n`.
   - The use of powers of 2 and specific adjustments ensures that the sequence meets the required conditions.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The function prints the sequence in the required format, ensuring it meets the problem constraints.
   - The sequence is constructed in such a way that it avoids any subsequence summing to `k` and covers all other values from 1 to `n`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `k == 1` and `n == 2`.
   - For other values of `k` and `n`, the function ensures that the sequence is constructed to meet the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly generates the required sequence for the given problem. It handles both special and general cases appropriately and ensures that the sequence meets all the specified conditions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
