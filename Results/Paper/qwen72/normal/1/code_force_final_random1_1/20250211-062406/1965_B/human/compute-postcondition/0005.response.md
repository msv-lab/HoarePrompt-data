The code snippet `sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')` writes the string representation of the return value of `func_14()` followed by a newline character to the standard output (console). Since `func_14()` has already been printed to the console according to the initial state, executing this line will print the same value again.

The initial state specifies that `func_10()` is greater than 0, and `func_14()` has been printed to the console. The execution of the code does not affect the value of `func_10()`, and it does not introduce any new variables or modify existing ones. It only affects the console output.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional effect of printing the value of `func_14()` to the console again.

Output State: **`func_10()` is greater than 0, `func_14()` has been printed to the console twice.**
