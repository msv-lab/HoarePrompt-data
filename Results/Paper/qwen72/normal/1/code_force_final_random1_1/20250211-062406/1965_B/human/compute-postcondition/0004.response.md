The only object in the loop head is the result of `func_10()`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `func_10()`. If `func_10()` returns a positive integer, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `func_10()` is greater than 0, and `func_14()` has been printed to the console.

For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must still return a value greater than 0. Since the loop counter `_` is not used in the loop head, it does not affect the loop's execution condition. The state of `func_14()` being printed to the console remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

State: **`func_10()` is greater than 0, `func_14()` has been printed to the console.**
