Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `k` is 1.
- `res` is the input string provided.
- The input provided to `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
- If `res` is `<`, then `k` is updated to 2.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`'?':`** This is a literal string `?` that will be printed as is.
2. **`0:`** This is a literal integer `0` that will be printed as is.
3. **`k:`** The value of `k` depends on the value of `res`. According to the initial state:
   - If `res` is `<`, then `k` is updated to 2.
   - Otherwise, `k` remains 1.
4. **`0:`** This is another literal integer `0` that will be printed as is.
5. **`i:`** The value of `i` is 3, as given in the initial state.

### Possible Values:
- If `res` is `<`, then `k` is 2.
- If `res` is not `<`, then `k` is 1.

### Final Output:
- If `res` is `<`, the output will be: `? 0 2 0 3`.
- If `res` is not `<`, the output will be: `? 0 1 0 3`.

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both cases. However, the problem does not specify which case to assume, so we should consider the most general case where `res` could be either `<` or something else.

### General Output:
Output: **? 0 [k] 0 3 (where [k] is 2 if res is '<', otherwise [k] is 1)**
