Initial State: `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2

Let's break down the `print` statement:

```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

- `'?'`: This is a string literal and will be printed as is.
- `0`: This is a numeric literal and will be printed as is.
- `k`: The value of `k` is not explicitly provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value.
- `0`: Another numeric literal, which will be printed as is.
- `i`: According to the initial state, `i` is 2. Therefore, it will be printed as 2.
- `flush=True`: This is an argument to the `print` function that ensures the output is immediately written to the console. It does not affect the content being printed.

Given this information, the output will include the string `'?'`, the number `0`, the value of `k` (which is unknown), another `0`, and the number `2`.

Output: **? 0 [k] 0 2 (where [k] is the value of the variable k, which is not specified in the initial state)**
