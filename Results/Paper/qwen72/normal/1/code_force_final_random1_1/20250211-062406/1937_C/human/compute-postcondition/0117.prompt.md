Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function operates in an environment where it can interactively query a hidden permutation p of {0, 1, ..., n-1} by specifying four indices a, b, c, d (0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n) and receiving a comparison result between (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d). The goal is to find indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, using at most 3n queries. The function handles multiple test cases, each with a different permutation, and the total number of test cases and the sum of n across all test cases are bounded.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    k = 1
    for i in range(2, n):
        print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            k = i
    best = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            best = i
    print('!', k, best, flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' or 1 if no such `i` exists, `best` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to the final value of `i`, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists, `best` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `best` is the largest value of `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
