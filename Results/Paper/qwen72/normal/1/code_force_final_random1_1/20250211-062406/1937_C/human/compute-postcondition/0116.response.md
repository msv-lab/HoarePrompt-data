Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is initialized to `n-1`.
- `best` is the largest value of `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop, or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('!', k, best, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`k`**:
   - `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'.
   - If no such `i` exists, `k` is set to 1.
   - Since `i` starts at `n-1` and decreases, `k` will be the last value of `i` where `res` was '<'.

2. **`best`**:
   - `best` is the largest value of `i` for which `res` was '<'.
   - If no such `i` exists, `best` is set to 0.
   - Since `i` starts at `n-1` and decreases, `best` will be the largest value of `i` where `res` was '<'.

### Possible Scenarios:
- If there is at least one `i` for which `res` was '<':
  - `k` will be the last such `i`.
  - `best` will be the largest such `i`.
- If there is no `i` for which `res` was '<':
  - `k` will be 1.
  - `best` will be 0.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the string `'!'`, followed by the values of `k` and `best`.

Output: **! [k] [best] (where k is the last value of i for which res was '<', or 1 if no such i exists, and best is the largest value of i for which res was '<', or 0 if no such i exists)**
