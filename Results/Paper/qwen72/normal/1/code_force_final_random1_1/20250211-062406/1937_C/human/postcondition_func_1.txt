The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both non-negative integers. It prints a formatted string "! [a] [b]" to the standard output, where `[a]` and `[b]` are the values of the parameters `a` and `b`, respectively. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program state is unchanged except for the side effect of the printed output.
