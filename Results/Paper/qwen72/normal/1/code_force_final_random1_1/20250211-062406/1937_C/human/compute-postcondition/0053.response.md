The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, and `res` is a new input string. If `res` is `<`, then `k` is 3. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.**
