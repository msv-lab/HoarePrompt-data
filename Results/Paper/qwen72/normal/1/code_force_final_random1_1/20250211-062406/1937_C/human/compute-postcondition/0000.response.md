The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. For the loop to execute, the expression `int(input())` must return a positive integer, indicating the number of iterations (test cases) the loop should perform.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the input must provide a positive integer value. The state of `_` is not relevant before the loop starts since it is initialized and incremented by the loop itself. However, for the loop to execute at least once, the input must be greater than 0.

State: **The input provided to `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
