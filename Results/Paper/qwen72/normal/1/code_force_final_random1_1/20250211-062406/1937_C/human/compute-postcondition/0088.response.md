Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `best` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `res` is an input string.
- If `res` is '<', then `k` is 2. Otherwise, `k` remains 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`'?'`**: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
2. **`0`**: This is a literal integer 0.
3. **`k`**: The value of `k` depends on the value of `res`.
   - If `res` is '<', then `k` is 2.
   - Otherwise, `k` is 1.
4. **`0`**: This is another literal integer 0.
5. **`i`**: The value of `i` is explicitly given as 3.

### Determining the Value of `k`:
- Since the value of `res` is not specified in the initial state, we need to consider both cases:
  - If `res` is '<', then `k` is 2.
  - If `res` is anything other than '<', then `k` is 1.

### Possible Outputs:
- If `res` is '<':
  ```python
  print('?', 0, 2, 0, 3, flush=True)
  ```
  Output: **? 0 2 0 3**

- If `res` is anything other than '<':
  ```python
  print('?', 0, 1, 0, 3, flush=True)
  ```
  Output: **? 0 1 0 3**

### Final Output:
Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both possibilities. However, the task requires us to provide the most precise description possible based on the precondition.

Output: **? 0 [k] 0 3 (where [k] is 2 if res is '<', otherwise [k] is 1)**
