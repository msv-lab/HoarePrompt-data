Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 4.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `best` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - If `res` is '<', `k` is 3.
   - Otherwise, `k` is 1 if `res` is not '<', otherwise `k` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `k`:**
   - The value of `k` depends on the value of `res`.
   - If `res` is '<', then `k` is 3.
   - If `res` is not '<', then `k` is 1.
   - If `res` is '<' but the condition is not met (which is not applicable here), `k` would be 2, but this case is not relevant because `res` being '<' already sets `k` to 3.

4. **Substitute the Values:**
   - The print statement will always start with `'?'`.
   - The next value is `0`.
   - The value of `k` will be either 3 or 1 depending on `res`.
   - The next value is `0`.
   - The value of `i` is 4.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `res` is '<', the output will be: `? 0 3 0 4`.
   - If `res` is not '<', the output will be: `? 0 1 0 4`.

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both cases:

Output: **? 0 3 0 4 (if res is '<') or ? 0 1 0 4 (if res is not '<')**
