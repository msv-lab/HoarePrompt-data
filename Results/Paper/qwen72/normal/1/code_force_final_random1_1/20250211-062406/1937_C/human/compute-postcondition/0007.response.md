The value of `k` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables (`n`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is 2, `res` is the input string `<`, and the input provided to `int(input())` must be greater than 0.**
