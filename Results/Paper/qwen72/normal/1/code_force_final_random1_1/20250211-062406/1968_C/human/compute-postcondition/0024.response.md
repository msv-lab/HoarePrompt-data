Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `1000 + sum(x[:i])`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 2 to 500.
- The list `x` remains unchanged as the input list of integers.
- The list `a` is now updated such that the first element `a[0]` is still 1000, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of the list `x`.
- The variable `i` is now `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
