The code snippet updates the value of `a[i]` using the formula `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `a[3]` will be updated to `a[2] + x[2]`.

From the initial state:
- `a[0]` is 1000
- `a[1]` is 1000 + `x[0]`
- `a[2]` is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`

So, `a[3]` will be:
- `a[3] = a[2] + x[2]`
- `a[3] = (1000 + x[0] + x[1]) + x[2]`
- `a[3] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`

The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros except `a[0]` which is 1000, `a[1]` which is 1000 + `x[0]`, `a[2]` which is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, and `a[3]` which is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**.
