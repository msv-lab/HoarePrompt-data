Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; x is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] * n
    a[0] = 1000
    for i in range(1, n):
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000 and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is 1000 + the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `1000 + sum(x[:i])`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `1000 + sum(x[:i])`, `i` is `n-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
