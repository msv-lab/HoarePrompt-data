The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `x`. This operation updates the value of `x` from its initial state (a new list of integers read from the input) to a specific list of integers based on the user's input.

Since the initial state already mentions that `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, the actual content of `x` will depend on the user's input. However, the structure of `x` as a list of integers remains consistent.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `i`) are not directly affected by this code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `1000 + sum(x[:i])`, `i` is `n-1`.**
