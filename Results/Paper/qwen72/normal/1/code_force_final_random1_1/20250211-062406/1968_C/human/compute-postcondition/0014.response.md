Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000 and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is 1000 + the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer. This new value of `n` is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, as specified in the initial state. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
