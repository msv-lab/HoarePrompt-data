The code snippet `a = [0] * n` initializes the list `a` to a list of zeros with a length of `n`. This overrides the previous definition of `a` which was a list where `a[0]` was 1000 and subsequent elements were calculated based on the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to all zeros, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
