Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `1000 + sum(x[:i])`, `i` is `n-1`.**

### Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is used to control the loop but is not modified within the loop.
- The list `x` remains unchanged as it is only read from within the loop.
- The list `a` is modified within the loop. Initially, `a[0]` is set to 1000. For each iteration `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is updated to be the value of `a[i-1]` plus `x[i-1]`. This means that `a[i]` will be equal to `1000 + sum(x[:i])`, where `sum(x[:i])` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`.
- The variable `i` is the loop index and will be `n-1` after the loop has completed all its iterations.
