Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 3, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to all zeros except `a[0]` which is 1000, `a[1]` is `1000 + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, `a[3]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`, `i` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[3]`.
- Given that `i` is 3, `a[3]` is set to `a[2] + x[2]`.
- From the initial state, `a[2]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`.
- Therefore, `a[3]` becomes `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
