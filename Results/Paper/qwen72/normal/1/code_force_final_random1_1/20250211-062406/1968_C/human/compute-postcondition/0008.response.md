Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros except `a[0]` which is 1000, `a[1]` which is 1000 + `x[0]`, and `a[2]` which is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2.** 

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` (which is `a[2]` since `i` is 2) to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[1]` and equals 1000 + `x[0]`) and `x[i - 1]` (which is `x[1]`). Therefore, `a[2]` becomes 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
