The `balance_info` list is sorted based on the `balance` attribute of each `BalanceInfo` object, and in case of ties, by the negative of the `position` attribute. This means that the list will be ordered first by the lowest `balance` value, and for objects with the same `balance`, by the highest `position`.

The sorting operation does not change the values of the `s` string, the `n` variable, or the contents of the `BalanceInfo` objects themselves; it only changes the order of the elements in the `balance_info` list.

Therefore, the Output State is: **After all iterations of the loop, `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. `n` is the length of `s` and remains unchanged. `balance_info` is now a sorted list containing `n` elements, where each element is a `BalanceInfo` object. The list is sorted first by the `balance` attribute in ascending order, and for elements with the same `balance`, by the `position` attribute in descending order. The final value of `balance` for the last element in the list will be 0 because `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence.**
