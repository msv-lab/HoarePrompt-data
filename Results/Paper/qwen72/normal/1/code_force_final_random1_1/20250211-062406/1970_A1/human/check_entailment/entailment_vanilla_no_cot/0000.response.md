Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Balance Calculation**: The `func_2` function calculates the balance of the prefix up to each character in the input string `s`. It appends this information along with the character and its position to the `balance_info` list.

2. **Sorting**: The `balance_info` list is sorted based on the balance and position as required. Specifically, it sorts by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order when balances are equal.

3. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the program constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list.

4. **Output**: The result string is printed, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string.

The program adheres to the problem's requirements and produces the correct output for the given example and any other valid balanced parentheses sequence. Therefore, the program is correct.
