#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of the character in the input sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance of `infoA` and the balance of `infoB`. Since the balance of `infoA` is not equal to the balance of `infoB`, the returned value will be a non-zero integer.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of the character in the input sequence. Additionally, `infoA.balance` is equal to `infoB.balance`.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between `infoB.position` and `infoA.position`, which is a positive integer representing the distance between the positions of the characters in the input sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two objects, `infoA` and `infoB`, each having attributes `balance` and `position`. It returns the difference between their balances if they are not equal, resulting in a non-zero integer. If the balances are equal, it returns the difference between their positions, which is a positive integer representing the distance between the positions of the characters in the input sequence. The function does not modify the input objects.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. `n` is the length of `s` and remains unchanged. `balance_info` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is a `BalanceInfo` object. Each `BalanceInfo` object in the list corresponds to an index `i` in the string `s`, with `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. For each `BalanceInfo` object, `i` is the index in the string, `s[i]` is the character at that index, and `balance` is the cumulative balance of parentheses up to that index. The final value of `balance` will be 0 because `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: a valid balanced parentheses sequence (rearranged version of the original string `s`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a non-empty string of balanced parentheses with a maximum length of 500,000. It processes the string to create a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, each containing the cumulative balance of parentheses, the index, and the character at that index. After sorting this list based on the balance and then the negative index, it constructs a new string from the sorted list and prints it. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints a rearranged version of the original string `s` that is also a valid balanced parentheses sequence.
