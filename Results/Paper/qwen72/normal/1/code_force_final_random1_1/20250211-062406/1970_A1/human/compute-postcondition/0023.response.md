The `balance_info` list is sorted based on the `balance` attribute of each `BalanceInfo` object, and in case of ties, by the negative of the `position` attribute. This means that the list will be ordered first by increasing `balance`, and for elements with the same `balance`, by decreasing `position`.

Since the sorting operation does not change the values of the attributes within the `BalanceInfo` objects, the values of `s`, `n`, and the individual `BalanceInfo` objects themselves remain the same. The only change is the order of the elements in the `balance_info` list.

Output State: **`s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. `n` is the length of `s` and remains unchanged. `balance_info` is now a sorted list of `n` elements, where each element is a `BalanceInfo` object. The list is sorted first by increasing `balance` and then by decreasing `position` in case of ties.**
