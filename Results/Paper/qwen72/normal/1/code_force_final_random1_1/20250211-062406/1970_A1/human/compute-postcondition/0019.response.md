The code snippet `balance -= 1` affects the `balance` attribute of the `BalanceInfo` objects in the `balance_info` list. Since all three `BalanceInfo` objects have the same `balance` value, which is either 2 or -2 depending on the third character of `s`, the `balance` value of each `BalanceInfo` object will be decreased by 1.

Let's break down the changes:

- If the third character of `s` is '(', then the initial `balance` value for each `BalanceInfo` object is 2. After executing `balance -= 1`, the `balance` value for each `BalanceInfo` object will be 1.
- If the third character of `s` is ')', then the initial `balance` value for each `BalanceInfo` object is -2. After executing `balance -= 1`, the `balance` value for each `BalanceInfo` object will be -3.

The other attributes (`i` and `s[i]`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2; `balance_info` is a list containing three `BalanceInfo` objects. The first `BalanceInfo` object has `i` set to 2, `s[i]` set to the third character of `s`, and `balance` set to 1 if the third character of `s` is '(', otherwise `balance` is set to -3. The second `BalanceInfo` object has `balance` set to 1 if the third character of `s` is '(', otherwise `balance` is set to -3, `i` set to 2, and `s[i]` set to the third character of `s`. The third `BalanceInfo` object has `balance` set to 1 if the third character of `s` is '(', otherwise `balance` is set to -3, `i` set to 2, and `s[i]` set to the third character of `s`.**
