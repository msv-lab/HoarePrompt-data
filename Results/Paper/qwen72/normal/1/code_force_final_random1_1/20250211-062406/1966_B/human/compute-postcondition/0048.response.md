The provided code snippet initializes an empty list `gr`. This action does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. The conditions and values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `ans`, and `impossible` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1), `m` is the new input integer, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is `n-1`. If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is 'NO'. If `impossible` is `True`, then for all `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `gr[i][0] == gr[i + 1][0]` and `gr[i][m - 1] == gr[i + 1][m - 1]`. If `impossible` is `False`, then `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.**
