The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, and the loop condition is `tc < t`. Therefore, we need to adjust `tc` for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is 0, and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `tc` must be incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`, `impossible`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1, `m` is the input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`. If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is 'NO'. Additionally, if `impossible` is `True`, then for all `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `gr[i][0] == gr[i + 1][0]` and `gr[i][m - 1] == gr[i + 1][m - 1]`. If `impossible` is `False`, then `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.**
