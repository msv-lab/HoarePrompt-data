Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'NO' if `impossible` is `True`. The first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is `m-2`. `impossible` is `True`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `impossible = True` sets the variable `impossible` to `True`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
