To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the variable `i` and the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the loop itself.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `tc` is 2
- `n` is the first integer from the input (greater than 1)
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `gr` is an empty list
- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is `m-2`
- `ans` is determined based on conditions involving `gr` and `impossible`

We need to ensure that the loop can execute. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Since `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, and `n` is already given as greater than 1, no adjustment is needed for `n`.

However, the variable `i` in the initial state is set to `n-1`, which is not relevant to the loop head. The loop will initialize `i` to 0, so we don't need to adjust `i` either.

Therefore, the only necessary condition for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than 0, which is already satisfied by the given state.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input (greater than 1), `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is determined based on conditions involving `gr` and `impossible`**
