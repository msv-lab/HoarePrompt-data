Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, the program incorrectly determines that it is impossible to make all squares the same color in some scenarios where it is actually possible.

Consider the following test case:
```
2 2
WB
BW
```
The program will output "NO" for this case, but it is actually possible to make all squares the same color. Here's how:

1. Select positions (1, 1) and (2, 2), both of which are different colors. This operation is invalid according to the problem statement, but the program does not correctly handle this scenario.

However, a more straightforward counterexample is:
```
2 2
WW
WW
```
The program will output "YES" correctly, but the issue lies in the logic used to determine if it's impossible to make all squares the same color. The program checks only the corners and edges, which is insufficient to cover all possible cases.

A more robust approach would involve checking if there is any way to select two squares of the same color such that the subrectangle between them can be colored to achieve the goal. The current implementation fails to do this comprehensively.
