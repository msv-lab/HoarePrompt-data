To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
```

The variables in the loop head are:
- `i`
- `n`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `tc` is 1
- `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1)
- `m` is the new input integer
- `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings
- `i` is 0
- `j` is `m-2`
- `impossible` is `False` or `True` based on the conditions described
- `ans` is 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions described

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain greater than 1.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- `n` remains the same, so `n` is still greater than 1.

The other variables (`t`, `tc`, `m`, `gr`, `j`, `impossible`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1), `m` is the new input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is 1, `j` is `m-2`. If the first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the first character of the second string in `gr`, or the last character of the first string in `gr` is different from the last character of the second string in `gr`, then `impossible` is `False` and `ans` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True` and `ans` is 'YES' if any pair of adjacent characters in the first string or the last string of `gr` are different, otherwise `ans` is 'NO'.**
