Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Variables and Initial Conditions:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `tc` is 1.
   - `n` is a new input integer greater than 1.
   - `m` is a new input integer.
   - `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `j` is `m-2`.

2. **Conditions and Logic:**
   - If `gr[0][0]` (the first character of the first string) is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]` (the last character of the last string):
     - If `impossible` is `True`, then `ans` is set to 'NO'.
     - If `impossible` is `False`, then `ans` is set to 'YES' if any of the following conditions are met:
       - Any pair of adjacent characters in the first string (`gr[0]`) are different.
       - Any pair of adjacent characters in the last string (`gr[n-1]`) are different.
       - Any pair of adjacent strings in `gr` have different first or last characters.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, `ans` remains 'YES' and `impossible` remains `False`.

3. **Determine the Value of `ans`:**
   - We need to check the conditions to determine the value of `ans`.
   - If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`:
     - If `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is 'NO'.
     - If `impossible` is `False`, we need to check the additional conditions:
       - If any pair of adjacent characters in `gr[0]` or `gr[n-1]` are different, or if any pair of adjacent strings in `gr` have different first or last characters, `ans` is 'YES'.
       - If none of these conditions are met, `ans` remains 'YES'.

Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for `gr`, `impossible`, and the exact strings, we can only describe the output based on the logical conditions provided.

Output: **'YES' or 'NO' (where 'YES' is printed if the conditions described in the initial state are met, and 'NO' is printed if `impossible` is `True` and `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1])**
