The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of a grid of characters ('W' for white and 'B' for black). For each test case, it determines whether the grid meets certain conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. Specifically, it checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid have the same color, and if the rows and columns along the edges of the grid are uniform in color. If any of these conditions are not met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
