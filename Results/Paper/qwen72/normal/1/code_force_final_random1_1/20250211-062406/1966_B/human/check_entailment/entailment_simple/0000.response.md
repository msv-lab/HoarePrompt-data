### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. It reads the dimensions of the grid (`n` and `m`) and the grid itself (`gr`).

2. **Initial Assumption**: The function starts with the assumption that it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color (`ans = 'YES'`).

3. **Edge Case Check**: The function checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid are different colors. If they are different, it sets a flag `impossible` to `True`.

4. **Row and Column Consistency Check**:
   - The function then checks if there are any inconsistencies in the first row and the last row. If any two adjacent cells in the first row or the last row are different, it sets `impossible` to `False`.
   - Similarly, it checks if there are any inconsistencies in the first column and the last column. If any two adjacent cells in the first column or the last column are different, it sets `impossible` to `False`.

5. **Final Decision**:
   - If `impossible` is still `True` after these checks, it means that the grid cannot be made uniform, and the function sets `ans` to `'NO'`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` remains `'YES'`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Logic**:
  - The logic is sound because if the top-left and bottom-right corners are different, and there are no inconsistencies in the first and last rows or columns, it implies that the grid can be made uniform.
  - However, the function does not check all possible subrectangles, which is necessary to ensure that the entire grid can be made uniform. The current logic only checks the borders, which might not be sufficient in all cases.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles edge cases like a 1x1 grid correctly.
  - It also handles cases where the grid is already uniform.

- **Potential Issues**:
  - The function might incorrectly return `'YES'` in some cases where the grid cannot be made uniform. For example, consider a grid where the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same, but there are internal inconsistencies that prevent the grid from being made uniform.

### Conclusion:
The function is **not** fully correct because it does not thoroughly check all possible subrectangles and might miss some cases where the grid cannot be made uniform.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
