Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1), `m` is the new input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`. If any pair of adjacent characters in the first string or the last string of `gr` are different, `impossible` is `False` and `ans` remains 'YES'. Otherwise, `impossible` is `True` and `ans` is set to 'NO'.***
