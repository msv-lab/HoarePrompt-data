Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 2, `m` is the input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is 2, `ans` is 'NO' if `impossible` was `True`, `j` is `m-2`. If the first character of the string at index `i` in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the string at index `i + 1` in `gr`, or the last character of the string at index `i` in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the string at index `i + 1` in `gr`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.***
