Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer (greater than 1), `m` is the last input integer (greater than 1), `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, and `ans` is either 'YES' or 'NO'. If the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, and if `impossible` is `True`, then `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, if any of the conditions `gr[k][0] != gr[k + 1][0]` or `gr[k][m - 1] != gr[k + 1][m - 1]` were true for any `k` in the range from 0 to `n-2`, then `impossible` is `False` and `ans` remains 'YES'. If none of these conditions are met, `impossible` remains `True` and `ans` remains 'YES'.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `tc` will have the value `t-1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times. The variables `n` and `m` will hold the dimensions of the grid for the last test case, and `gr` will contain the grid for the last test case. The variable `i` will be `n-1`, and `j` will be `m-2`. The variable `ans` will be 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop for each test case. If the first and last cells of the grid are different and no adjacent cells in the first or last row or column differ, `ans` will be 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` will be 'YES'.
