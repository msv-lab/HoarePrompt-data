The code snippet sets the variable `impossible` to `False`. This overrides the previous condition that `impossible` was `True` if the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the second string in `gr`, or the last character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the second string in `gr`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1, `m` is the input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is 1, `ans` is 'NO' if `impossible` was `True`, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is `m-2`, `impossible` is now `False`.**
