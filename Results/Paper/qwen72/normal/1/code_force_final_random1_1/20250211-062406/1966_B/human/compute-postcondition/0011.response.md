Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `m` are input integers, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` must be greater than 0:** This condition remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`tc` is 0:** This condition also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n` is the input integer:** The value of `n` remains the same throughout the loop, as it determines the number of iterations.
- **`m` are input integers:** This condition remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`gr` is a list containing `n` input strings:** After the loop completes, `gr` will contain `n` elements, each being an input string.
- **`i` is `n-1`:** The loop variable `i` will be `n-1` after the last iteration, as the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
