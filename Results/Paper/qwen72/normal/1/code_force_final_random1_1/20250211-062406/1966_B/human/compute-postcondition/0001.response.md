The only variables in the loop head are `tc` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `t` being an input integer representing the number of test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0 and `tc` is 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0**
