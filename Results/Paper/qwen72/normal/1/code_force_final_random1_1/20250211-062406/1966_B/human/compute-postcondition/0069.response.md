Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1), `m` is the new input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `j` is `m-2`. If any pair of adjacent characters in the first string or the last string of `gr` are different, `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `m-1` times, so after all iterations, `j` will be `m-2`.
- The condition inside the loop checks if the current character and the next character in the first and last strings of `gr` are different. If any such pair is found, `impossible` is set to `False`.
- If no such pair is found throughout the loop, `impossible` remains `True`.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
