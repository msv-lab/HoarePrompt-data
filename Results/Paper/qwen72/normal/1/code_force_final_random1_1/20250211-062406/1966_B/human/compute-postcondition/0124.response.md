Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input (greater than 1), `m` is the second integer from the input (greater than 1), `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is a user's input), `i` is 1, `j` is `m-2`, the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`. If `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is `False` and `ans` remains 'YES'. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `False` and `ans` remains 'YES'.***
