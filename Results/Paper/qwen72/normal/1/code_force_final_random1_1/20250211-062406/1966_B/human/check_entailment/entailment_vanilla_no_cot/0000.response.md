Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in determining whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Specifically, the conditions under which the variable `impossible` is set to `False` are not comprehensive enough to cover all scenarios where it might be impossible to achieve a uniform grid color.

The main issue lies in the logic that checks the edges of the grid (first and last row, first and last column) to see if they have a consistent color pattern. This approach fails to consider the internal structure of the grid, which can also prevent achieving a uniform color. For example, a grid where the corners are different colors but the edges are consistent can still be impossible to make uniform, depending on the internal cells.

A more robust approach would involve checking if there exists at least one cell of each color ('W' and 'B') in the grid. If both colors are present, then it is impossible to make the entire grid a single color because no operation can change the color of a cell to a color that is not already present in the grid. If only one color is present, then the grid is already uniform, and no operations are needed.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if both 'W' and 'B' are present in the grid
        has_white = any('W' in row for row in gr)
        has_black = any('B' in row for row in gr)
        
        if has_white and has_black:
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
```

This version correctly identifies whether it is possible to make the entire grid a single color by checking for the presence of both colors in the grid.
