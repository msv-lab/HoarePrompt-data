You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Program:

    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = []
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        ans = 'YES'
        if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
            impossible = True
            for j in range(m - 1):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
            impossible = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of a grid of characters ('W' for white and 'B' for black). For each test case, it determines whether the grid meets certain conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. Specifically, it checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid have the same color, and if the rows and columns along the edges of the grid are uniform in color. If any of these conditions are not met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the specified operations.
   - An operation involves selecting two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - If the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) are different colors, it suggests that the grid might not be easily uniformed.
   - However, this alone is not sufficient to conclude that it's impossible to make the grid uniform. We need to check further.

3. **Edge Checks**:
   - The program checks if there are any adjacent cells in the first row or last row that are different colors. If all such pairs are the same color, it sets `impossible` to `False`.
   - Similarly, it checks if there are any adjacent cells in the first column or last column that are different colors. If all such pairs are the same color, it sets `impossible` to `False`.

4. **Final Decision**:
   - If `impossible` remains `True` after checking the edges, it means the grid cannot be made uniform, and the answer is set to `NO`.
   - Otherwise, the answer is `YES`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the grid is already uniform (all cells are the same color).
   - It also handles the case where the grid is a single cell, which is trivially uniform.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program only checks the edges of the grid. This might not be sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform. For example, a grid with alternating colors in a checkerboard pattern would fail this check, even though it might be possible to make it uniform with the right operations.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is flawed because it only checks the edges of the grid. It does not consider the possibility of making the entire grid uniform through operations that involve non-edge cells. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
