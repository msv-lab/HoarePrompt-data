To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for j in range(m - 1):
```

The variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m - 1` is greater than 0, which means `m` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `tc` is 2
- `n` is the first integer from the input (greater than 1)
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is a user's input)
- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is `m-2`
- `ans` is 'YES'
- The first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`
- `impossible` is `True`

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than 1 and `j` is set to 0 before the loop starts.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `tc` is 2
- `n` is the first integer from the input (greater than 1)
- `m` is the second integer from the input (must be greater than 1)
- `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is a user's input)
- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is 0
- `ans` is 'YES'
- The first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`
- `impossible` is `True`

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input (greater than 1), `m` is the second integer from the input (must be greater than 1), `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is a user's input), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is 0, `ans` is 'YES', the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, and `impossible` is `True`**
