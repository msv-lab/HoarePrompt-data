Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input (greater than 1), `m` is the second integer from the input (greater than 1), `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is a user's input), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`. For all `k` in the range from 0 to `n-2`, `gr[k][0] == gr[k + 1][0]` and `gr[k][m - 1] == gr[k + 1][m - 1]` hold true. `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is 'NO'.**
