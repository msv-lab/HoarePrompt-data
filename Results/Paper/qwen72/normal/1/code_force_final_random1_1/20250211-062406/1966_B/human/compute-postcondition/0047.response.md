The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. This impacts the initial state by updating the values of `n` and `m` based on the user's input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `tc` is 1
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1
- `m` is the input integer
- `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings
- `i` is `n-1`
- If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is 'NO'
- If `impossible` is `True`, then for all `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `gr[i][0] == gr[i + 1][0]` and `gr[i][m - 1] == gr[i + 1][m - 1]`
- If `impossible` is `False`, then `ans` remains 'NO'
- Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` and `m` are updated to the new input values, which must be integers and `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1), `m` is the new input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`. If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is 'NO'. If `impossible` is `True`, then for all `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `gr[i][0] == gr[i + 1][0]` and `gr[i][m - 1] == gr[i + 1][m - 1]`. If `impossible` is `False`, then `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.**
