Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input (greater than 1), `m` is the second integer from the input (greater than 1), `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is a user's input), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is 'YES', the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`. The variable `impossible` is `True`, indicating that none of the conditions `gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]` were true for any `j` in the range `0` to `m-2`.**
