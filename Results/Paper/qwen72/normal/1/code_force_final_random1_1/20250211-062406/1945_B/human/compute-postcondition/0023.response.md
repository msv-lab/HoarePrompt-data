Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It calculates the minimum of `a` and `b`, adds `m` to this minimum, and then checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1. If these conditions are met, it prints a specific calculation involving these values; otherwise, it prints a slightly different calculation. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
