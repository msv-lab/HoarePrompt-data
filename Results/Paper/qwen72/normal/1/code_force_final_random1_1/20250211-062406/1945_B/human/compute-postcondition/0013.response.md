To determine what will be printed by the `print(mn // a + mn // b)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is the first integer from the user's input.
   - `b` is the second integer from the user's input.
   - `m` is the third integer from the user's input.
   - `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1, then the conditions for divisibility and non-unity of `a` and `b` are met.
   - Otherwise, either `m` is not divisible by `a`, or `m` is not divisible by `b`, or `a` is 1, or `b` is 1.

3. **Calculation:**
   - `mn` is calculated as `min(a, b) + m`.
   - The expression `mn // a + mn // b` involves integer division of `mn` by `a` and `b`, and then summing the results.

Let's analyze the expression step by step:

- **Calculate `mn`:**
  - `mn = min(a, b) + m`

- **Calculate `mn // a` and `mn // b`:**
  - `mn // a` gives the integer division of `mn` by `a`.
  - `mn // b` gives the integer division of `mn` by `b`.

- **Sum the results:**
  - The final result is `mn // a + mn // b`.

Given the conditions, if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, then the calculation will proceed as described. Otherwise, the conditions will affect the divisibility, but the expression `mn // a + mn // b` will still be evaluated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(mn // a + mn // b) (where mn is the minimum of a and b plus m, and a, b, and m are the user-provided integers)**
