The value of `mn` is calculated as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers derived from the user's input, `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.**
