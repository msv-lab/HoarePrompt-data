The code snippet `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into three parts, and assigns each part to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m` after converting them to integers.

- `t` remains an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` remains 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are now integers derived from the user's input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers derived from the user's input.**
