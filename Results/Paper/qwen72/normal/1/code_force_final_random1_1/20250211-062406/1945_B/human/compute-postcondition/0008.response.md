Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers derived from the user's input, and `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1, then the conditions for divisibility and non-unity of `a` and `b` are met. Otherwise, either `m` is not divisible by `a`, or `m` is not divisible by `b`, or `a` is 1, or `b` is 1.***
