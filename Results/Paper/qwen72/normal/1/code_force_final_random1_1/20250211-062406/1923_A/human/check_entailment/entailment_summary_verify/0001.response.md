### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array `arr` representing the ribbon.
   - The array `arr` is converted to a string by joining the input elements and removing spaces. This step ensures that the input is treated as a continuous string, which is necessary for the subsequent operations.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip:**
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first chip (from the left).
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the first chip from the right (by reversing the string and finding the first '1'). This effectively gives the distance from the end of the string to the last chip.

3. **Extracting the Substring with Chips:**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` extracts the substring from the first chip to the last chip, inclusive. This ensures that we only consider the part of the ribbon that contains chips.
   - The expression `n - y` correctly calculates the index of the last chip from the start of the string.

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of free cells ('0's) in the extracted substring.
   - This count represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `8\n0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
  - `arr = '01110110'`
  - `x = 1` (first '1' at index 1)
  - `y = 2` (first '1' from the right at index 6, so `n - y = 6`)
  - `z = '111011'`
  - `z.count('0') = 1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `6\n0 1 0 0 0 0`
  - `arr = '010000'`
  - `x = 1` (first '1' at index 1)
  - `y = 5` (first '1' from the right at index 1, so `n - y = 1`)
  - `z = '1'`
  - `z.count('0') = 0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `6\n1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - `arr = '111111'`
  - `x = 0` (first '1' at index 0)
  - `y = 0` (first '1' from the right at index 5, so `n - y = 6`)
  - `z = '111111'`
  - `z.count('0') = 0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `5\n1 0 1 0 1`
  - `arr = '10101'`
  - `x = 0` (first '1' at index 0)
  - `y = 1` (first '1' from the right at index 4, so `n - y = 4`)
  - `z = '10101'`
  - `z.count('0') = 2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `9\n0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
  - `arr = '011000110'`
  - `x = 1` (first '1' at index 1)
  - `y = 2` (first '1' from the right at index 7, so `n - y = 7`)
  - `z = '1100011'`
  - `z.count('0') = 3`
  - Output: `3` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and produces the expected output. The logic for finding the first and last chip, extracting the relevant substring, and counting the free cells is sound and matches the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
