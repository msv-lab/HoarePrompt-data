The code snippet `z = arr[x:n - y]` updates the value of `z` based on the slicing operation on `arr` using the indices `x` and `n - y`. Let's break down the impact:

- `t` remains greater than 0 and is decremented by 1.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `arr` remains the new input string with all spaces removed.
- `x` remains the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found.
- `y` remains the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found.
- `z` is updated to the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1`.

However, the slicing operation `arr[x:n - y]` needs to be carefully considered:
- If `x` is `-1` or `y` is `-1`, the slicing operation will result in an empty string because the start or end index is invalid.
- If `x` and `y` are valid indices and `n - y > x`, then `z` will be the substring from `x` to `n - y - 1`.
- If `n - y <= x`, then `z` will be an empty string.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the new input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1` if `x` and `y` are valid and `n - y > x`, otherwise `z` is an empty string.**
