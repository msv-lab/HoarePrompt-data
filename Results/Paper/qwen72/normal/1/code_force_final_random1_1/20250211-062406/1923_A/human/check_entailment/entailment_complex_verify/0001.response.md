### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array `arr` representing the ribbon.
   - The array `arr` is converted to a string by joining the input elements and removing spaces. This step is correct and ensures that the input is processed as a continuous string of '0's and '1's.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip:**
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first chip (from the left). This is correct.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the first chip from the right (by reversing the string and finding the first '1'). This is also correct.

3. **Extracting the Substring with Chips:**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` extracts the substring from the first chip to the last chip, inclusive. This step is crucial and needs careful consideration:
     - `x` is the index of the first '1'.
     - `n - y` is the index of the last '1' from the right, adjusted to be relative to the start of the string.
     - The slice `arr[x:n - y]` correctly captures the substring containing all chips and any free cells between them.

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of free cells ('0's) in the extracted substring.
   - This count represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `8\n0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
  - `arr = '01110110'`
  - `x = 1` (first '1' at index 1)
  - `y = 2` (first '1' from the right at index 6, so `n - y = 6`)
  - `z = '111011'`
  - `z.count('0') = 1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `6\n0 1 0 0 0 0`
  - `arr = '010000'`
  - `x = 1` (first '1' at index 1)
  - `y = 5` (first '1' from the right at index 1, so `n - y = 1`)
  - `z = '1'`
  - `z.count('0') = 0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `6\n1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - `arr = '111111'`
  - `x = 0` (first '1' at index 0)
  - `y = 0` (first '1' from the right at index 5, so `n - y = 6`)
  - `z = '111111'`
  - `z.count('0') = 0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `5\n1 0 1 0 1`
  - `arr = '10101'`
  - `x = 0` (first '1' at index 0)
  - `y = 1` (first '1' from the right at index 4, so `n - y = 4`)
  - `z = '10101'`
  - `z.count('0') = 2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `9\n0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
  - `arr = '011000110'`
  - `x = 1` (first '1' at index 1)
  - `y = 2` (first '1' from the right at index 7, so `n - y = 7`)
  - `z = '1100011'`
  - `z.count('0') = 3`
  - Output: `3` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and produces the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
