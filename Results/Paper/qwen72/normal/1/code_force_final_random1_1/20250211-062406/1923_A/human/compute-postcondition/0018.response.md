The code snippet `n = int(input(''))` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer. The other variables (`t`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is a new input integer, `arr` is the new input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in the new `arr`, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in the new `arr`, `z` is the substring of the new `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1` if `x` and `y` are valid and `n - y > x`, otherwise `z` is an empty string.**
