To determine what will be printed by the `print(z.count('0'))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and is decremented by 1.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - `arr` is a new input string with all spaces removed.
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found.
   - `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found.
   - `z` is the substring of the new `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1` if `x` and `y` are valid and `n - y > x`, otherwise `z` is an empty string.

2. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - **Remove Spaces from `arr`:**
     - `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed.
   - **Find `x` and `y`:**
     - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
     - `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
   - **Determine `z`:**
     - If `x` and `y` are valid (i.e., not `-1`) and `n - y > x`, then `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1`.
     - Otherwise, `z` is an empty string.
   - **Count '0's in `z`:**
     - The `print(z.count('0'))` statement will print the number of '0's in the substring `z`.

3. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `x` or `y` is `-1`, `z` will be an empty string, and `z.count('0')` will be `0`.
   - If `x` and `y` are valid but `n - y <= x`, `z` will be an empty string, and `z.count('0')` will be `0`.
   - If `x` and `y` are valid and `n - y > x`, `z` will be the substring from `x` to `n - y - 1`, and `z.count('0')` will count the number of '0's in this substring.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the number of '0's in the substring `z` if `z` is not an empty string. If `z` is an empty string, the output will be `0`.

Output: **z.count('0') (where z is the substring of arr from index x to n - y - 1 if x and y are valid and n - y > x, otherwise z is an empty string)**
