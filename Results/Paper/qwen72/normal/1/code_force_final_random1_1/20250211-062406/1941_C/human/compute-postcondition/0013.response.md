Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `a` is an input integer where 1 ≤ a, `s` is the new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`**

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` updates the value of `a` to a new input integer, which is within the range 1 ≤ a. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `s`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
