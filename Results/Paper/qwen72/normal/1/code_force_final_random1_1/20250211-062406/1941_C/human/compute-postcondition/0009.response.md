Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer where 1 ≤ a, `s` is the new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**

Explanation: The code `x = s.count('map')` updates the value of `x` to the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `s`, and `y`) remain unchanged. The new value of `x` is specifically the count of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
