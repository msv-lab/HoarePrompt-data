The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than the result of `int(input())`.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to execute again is that the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `a` is an input integer where 1 ≤ a, `s` is the new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`**. The loop will execute again if the result of `int(input())` is greater than 1.
