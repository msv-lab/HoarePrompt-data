Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `a` is an input integer where 1 ≤ a, `s` is the new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.** 

The value of `x` is updated to the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
