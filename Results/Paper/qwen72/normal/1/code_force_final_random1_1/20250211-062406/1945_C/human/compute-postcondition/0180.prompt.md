Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `lst` is an empty list, `ele` is the last element in the original `lst`, `mini` is 100000000, `final` contains all elements from the original `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`, sorted in ascending order. If `len(final) == 0`, `final` now includes either 0 or `n` depending on whether `c1` is greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50, respectively, and the length of `final` is 1. The loop will execute one more time if `t` is greater than 0. `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`. `zero` is 0, `one` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`lst` is an empty list or a list containing `[1]` based on whether `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50. `ele` is undefined, `mini` is 100000000, `final` is an empty list or contains either 0 or `n` based on `c1`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `i` is 0, if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0' then `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0 and `zero_perc` is 100, otherwise `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1 and `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`one_perc` is updated to `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. If `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is an empty list or a list containing `[1, 2]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list or a list containing `[1]`. `ele` remains undefined, `mini` remains 100000000, `final` remains an empty list or contains either 0 or `n` based on `c1`, `t` remains greater than 0, `n` remains greater than 2, `s` remains the input string, `pk` remains `n / 2`, `sl` remains a list containing the characters of `s`, `o` remains the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` remains the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `i` remains 1, `zero` remains 0 or 1 depending on the character at index `i` in `s`, `one` remains 0 or 1 depending on the character at index `i` in `s`, and `zero_perc` remains 0 or 50 depending on the character at index `i` in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`one_perc` is updated to `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '1', `zero_perc` is updated to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is an empty list or a list containing `[1, 2, 3]`; otherwise, `lst` is an empty list or a list containing `[1, 2]`. `ele` remains undefined, `mini` remains 100000000, `final` remains an empty list or contains either 0 or `n` based on `c1`, `t` remains greater than 0, `n` remains greater than 2, `s` remains the input string, `pk` remains `n / 2`, `sl` remains a list containing the characters of `s`, `o` remains the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` remains the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `i` is 2, `zero` and `one` are updated based on the character at index `i` in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
