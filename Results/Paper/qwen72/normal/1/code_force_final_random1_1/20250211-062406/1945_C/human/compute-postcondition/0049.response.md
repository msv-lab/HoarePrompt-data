Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, and `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` are both greater than or equal to 50.**

Explanation:
- The variable `mini` is updated in each iteration of the loop to the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `lst`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
