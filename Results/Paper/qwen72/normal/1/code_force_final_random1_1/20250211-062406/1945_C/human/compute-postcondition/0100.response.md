Output State: **`one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `t` is `t - 1`, and if `s[i]` is not '0', `one` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `one_perc` is updated to the value of `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.
- `t` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `t - 1`.
- If `s[i]` is not '0', `one` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `mini`, `i`, `zero`, `zero_perc`, `lst`, `final`, `c1`) remain unchanged.
