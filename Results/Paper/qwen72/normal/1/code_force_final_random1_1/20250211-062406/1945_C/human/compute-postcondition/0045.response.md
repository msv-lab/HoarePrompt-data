To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is `ele` and `lst`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Objects**: The loop head is `for ele in lst:`. This means that the loop iterates over elements in the list `lst`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `t` is greater than 0
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `s` is an input string
   - `pk` is `n / 2`
   - `sl` is a list of characters from `s`
   - `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`
   - `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`
   - `mini` is the minimum value between 100000000 and `abs(n / 2 - ele)`
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `zero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`
   - `one` is the count of '1' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`
   - `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`
   - `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`
   - `lst` contains at least one element

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will execute one more time if there is another element in `lst` to be assigned to `ele`.
   - Since `lst` contains at least one element, for the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must contain at least two elements.

### Adjusted State:
- `ele` will be the next element in `lst`.
- `lst` must contain at least two elements.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value between 100000000 and `abs(n / 2 - ele)`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` contains at least two elements**
