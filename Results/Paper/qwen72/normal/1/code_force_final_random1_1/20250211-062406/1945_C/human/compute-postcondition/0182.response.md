The code snippet updates the value of `mini` to the minimum between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. Since `ele` was previously undefined, it must be defined somewhere in the context not shown here. Assuming `pk` and `mini` are already defined, the new value of `mini` will be the smaller of its original value or the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.

Output State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `ele` remains undefined, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.**
