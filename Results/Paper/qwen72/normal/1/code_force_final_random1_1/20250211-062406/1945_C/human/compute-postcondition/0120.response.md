The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. For the loop to execute, `lst` must have at least one element. The variable `elem` will take the value of the first element in `lst` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`lst` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is updated to the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `final` is an empty list**
