Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Initial Setup**: The function initializes variables to keep track of the counts of '0's and '1's, and sets up a list `lst` to store potential positions where the road can be built.

3. **Iterating Through Houses**: The function iterates through the houses (up to `n-1`), updating the counts of '0's and '1's as it goes. It calculates the percentage of '0's on the left side and the percentage of '1's on the right side for each position.

4. **Condition Check**: The function checks if the current position satisfies the condition that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. If so, it adds the position to the list `lst`.

5. **Finding the Optimal Position**: After identifying all valid positions, the function finds the position closest to the middle of the village (`n/2`). If there are multiple such positions, it selects the smallest one.

6. **Handling No Valid Positions**: If no valid positions are found, the function checks the overall preference of the residents. If the majority prefer '1', it outputs 0; otherwise, it outputs `n`.

7. **Output**: The function prints the smallest optimal index for each test case.

Based on the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. However, there are a few minor issues that could be improved:

- **Redundant Calculation of `pk`**: The variable `pk` is set to `n / 2` regardless of whether `n` is even or odd. This is unnecessary and can be simplified.
- **Percentage Calculation**: The percentage calculation using `* 100 // (i + 1)` and `* 100 // (n - i - 1)` is not strictly necessary for the problem. Instead, you can directly check if the count of '0's and '1's meets the required condition.

Despite these minor issues, the core logic of the function is correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
