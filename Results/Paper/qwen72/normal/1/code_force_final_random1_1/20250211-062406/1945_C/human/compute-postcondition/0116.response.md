The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ele` and the list `lst`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If `lst` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in `lst`. For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must have at least 3 elements, and `ele` will be the third element in `lst`.

State: **`lst` must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in `lst`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element in `lst`.**
