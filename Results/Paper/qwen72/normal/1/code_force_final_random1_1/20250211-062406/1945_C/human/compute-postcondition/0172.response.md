To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than 2.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `i in range(n - 1)`, which means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

### Adjusting the State:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
- The condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true for the loop to execute again. Since `n` is greater than 2, `n - 1` is greater than 1. Therefore, `i = 2` should still be less than `n - 1`.

### Updated State:
- `i` is now 2.
- `n` remains greater than 2.

### Final State:
State: **`one_perc` is updated to `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. If `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is an empty list or a list containing `[1, 2]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list or a list containing `[1]`. `ele` remains undefined, `mini` remains 100000000, `final` remains an empty list or contains either 0 or `n` based on `c1`, `t` remains greater than 0, `n` remains greater than 2, `s` remains the input string, `pk` remains `n / 2`, `sl` remains a list containing the characters of `s`, `o` remains the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` remains the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `i` is 2, `zero` remains 0 or 1 depending on the character at index `i` in `s`, `one` remains 0 or 1 depending on the character at index `i` in `s`, and `zero_perc` remains 0 or 50 depending on the character at index `i` in `s`.**
