To determine what will be printed by the `print(final[0])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `lst` is a list with all its original elements.
   - `ele` is the last element in `lst`.
   - `mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`.
   - `final` contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`, sorted in ascending order.
   - If `len(final) == 0`, `final` now includes either 0 or `n` depending on whether `c1` is greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50, respectively, and the length of `final` is 1.

2. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - First, we need to find the minimum absolute difference (`mini`) between `pk` and each element in `lst`.
   - Next, we create a list `final` that contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`.
   - If `final` is empty after this step, it means no element in `lst` has an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`. In this case, `final` is set to contain either 0 or `n` based on the value of `c1`.

3. **Final Output:**
   - If `final` is not empty, `final[0]` will be the first element of the sorted list `final`.
   - If `final` is empty, `final` will be set to `[0]` if `c1 >= 50` or `[n]` if `c1 < 50`.

Given these steps, the value of `final[0]` will be:
- The smallest element in `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`, if such elements exist.
- 0 if `c1 >= 50` and no such elements exist.
- `n` if `c1 < 50` and no such elements exist.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **final[0] (where final[0] is the first element of the sorted list `final` containing elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`, or 0 if `c1 >= 50` and no such elements exist, or `n` if `c1 < 50` and no such elements exist)**
