The only objects in the loop head are `ele` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must contain at least one more element beyond the current `ele`.

At the end of the last iteration, `lst` must contain at least two elements, `ele` is the next element in `lst`, and `mini` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the last `ele` processed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must still contain at least one more element, making it at least three elements in total. The next `ele` will be the element following the current `ele` in `lst`.

State: **`lst` must contain at least three elements, `ele` is the next element in `lst` after the previous `ele`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the last `ele` processed.**
