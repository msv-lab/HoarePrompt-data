Output State: **`lst` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `lst`, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is updated to the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, `final` now contains the first element of `lst` and `elem`. Otherwise, `final` contains `elem`.**

Explanation:
- The code `final.append(elem)` adds the value of `elem` (which is the third element in `lst`) to the list `final`.
- If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, `final` initially contained the first element of `lst`. After appending `elem`, `final` now contains both the first element of `lst` and `elem`.
- If `abs(pk - elem) != mini`, `final` was initially an empty list. After appending `elem`, `final` now contains only `elem`.
- All other variables (`lst`, `elem`, `ele`, `mini`, and `pk`) remain unchanged.
