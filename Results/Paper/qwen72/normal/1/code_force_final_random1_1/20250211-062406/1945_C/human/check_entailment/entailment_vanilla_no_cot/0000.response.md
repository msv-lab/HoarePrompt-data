Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided solution has a few issues that prevent it from being fully correct according to the problem statement. Here are the main points:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Satisfaction**: The program calculates the percentage of satisfaction (`zero_perc` and `one_perc`) using a fixed threshold of 50%. However, the problem requires that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied, which means the threshold should be calculated as `ceil(x / 2)` where `x` is the number of residents on that side. This is not correctly implemented in the code.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house (i.e., `i = 0`) or after the last house (i.e., `i = n`). The logic to check these cases is not robust and may fail in certain scenarios.

3. **Optimizing the Position**: The program attempts to find the position closest to the middle of the village but does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple positions have the same minimum distance. The logic to select the smallest index in such cases is not clear and may not work as intended.

4. **Redundant Calculations**: The program calculates the total count of '0's and '1's in the string, which is unnecessary for the solution. The focus should be on the cumulative counts as the road position is iterated.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        
        # Initialize prefix sums for zeros and ones
        prefix_zeros = [0] * (n + 1)
        prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_zeros[i + 1] = prefix_zeros[i] + (s[i] == '0')
            prefix_ones[i + 1] = prefix_ones[i] + (s[i] == '1')
        
        best_pos = -1
        min_diff = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            left_zeros = prefix_zeros[i]
            left_ones = i - left_zeros
            right_zeros = prefix_zeros[n] - prefix_zeros[i]
            right_ones = n - i - right_zeros
            
            left_satisfied = left_zeros >= math.ceil(i / 2)
            right_satisfied = right_ones >= math.ceil((n - i) / 2)
            
            if left_satisfied and right_satisfied:
                diff = abs(n / 2 - i)
                if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and i < best_pos):
                    best_pos = i
                    min_diff = diff
        
        print(best_pos)

func()
```

This corrected version uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the number of zeros and ones on both sides of the road for each possible position. It then checks the satisfaction conditions and finds the optimal position that minimizes the distance from the middle of the village.
