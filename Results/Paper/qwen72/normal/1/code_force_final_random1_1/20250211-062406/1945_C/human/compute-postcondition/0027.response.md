The value of `zero` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 1, `zero` is 2 if the character at index `1` in `s` is '0' otherwise `zero` is 1, `one` is 0 if the character at index `1` in `s` is '0' otherwise `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 100 if the character at index `1` in `s` is '0' otherwise `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is [1]**.
