Output State: **`one_perc` is updated to `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '1', `zero_perc` is updated to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `lst` is an empty list or a list containing `[1, 2]` if both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50; otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list or a list containing `[1]`. `ele` remains undefined, `mini` remains 100000000, `final` remains an empty list or contains either 0 or `n` based on `c1`, `t` remains greater than 0, `n` remains greater than 2, `s` remains the input string, `pk` remains `n / 2`, `sl` remains a list containing the characters of `s`, `o` remains the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` remains the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `i` is 2, `zero` and `one` are updated based on the character at index `i` in `s`.**

Explanation:
- `one_perc` is updated to `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.
- `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[2]` is '0'.
- `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[2]` is '1'.
- `zero_perc` is updated to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`.
- `lst` is updated based on the conditions involving `zero_perc` and `one_perc`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
