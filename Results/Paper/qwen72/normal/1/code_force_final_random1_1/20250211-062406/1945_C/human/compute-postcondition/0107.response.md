Output State: **`zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (i + 1) - 1)`, `t` is `t - 1`, and if `s[i + 1]` is not '0', `one` is incremented by 1. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` now includes the value `i + 2`. If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `zero_perc` is updated to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`.
- The values of `one_perc`, `t`, and the conditions for updating `one` and `zero` based on `s[i + 1]` and `s[i]` remain the same.
- The condition for appending `i + 2` to `lst` remains unchanged.
- All other variables and their states remain the same as described in the initial state.
