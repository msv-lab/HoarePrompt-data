The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Since the state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an input integer, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly set.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
