Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50. `ele` remains undefined, `mini` remains 100000000, `final` remains an empty list or contains either 0 or `n` based on `c1`, `t` remains greater than 0, `n` remains the same, `s` remains the input string, `pk` remains `n / 2`, `sl` remains a list containing the characters of `s`, `o` remains the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` remains the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the total count of '0' characters in `s` up to index `n - 2`, `one` is the total count of '1' characters in `s` up to index `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, and `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `lst` must contain at least one element, `ele` remains undefined, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `lst` must contain at least two elements, `ele` is the next element in `lst`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the last `ele` processed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `lst` must contain at least three elements, `ele` is the next element in `lst` after the previous `ele`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the last `ele` processed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
