Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 2, `zero` is 3 if the character at index `1` in `s` is '0' otherwise `zero` is 2, `one` is 0 if the character at index `1` in `s` is '0' otherwise `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, and `lst` is unchanged unless `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, in which case `3` is appended to `lst`.***
