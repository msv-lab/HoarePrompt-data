Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` is a list of indices, and `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` that have the minimum absolute difference with `pk`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in `lst`.
- For each element `elem` in `lst`, it checks if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.
- If the condition is met, `elem` is appended to the `final` list.
- After all iterations, `final` will contain all elements from `lst` that have the minimum absolute difference with `pk`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
