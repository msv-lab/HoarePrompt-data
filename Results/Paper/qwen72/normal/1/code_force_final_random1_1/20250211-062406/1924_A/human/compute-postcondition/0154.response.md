To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `k`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Execution**: The loop `for i in range(k)` will execute if `k` is greater than 0. The value of `i` will start at 0 and increment until it reaches `k-1`.
3. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be initialized to 0.
   - `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

### Adjusted State:
- `cur` remains 0.
- `cnt` remains the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met.
- `ans` remains a string containing the characters from `s` that were added when `cur` was reset to 0.
- `tmp` remains an empty string.
- `cnt` remains less than `n`.
- `i` is 0.
- `k` must be greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that were added when `cur` was reset to 0, `tmp` is an empty string, `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
