Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must contain at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the first character of `s`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to include the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` if it was initially 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must contain at least two characters, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must contain at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` relative to 'a'. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `ss`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
