Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must contain at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97. If the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0, then `cur` is updated to include this bit (i.e., `cur` is set to `cur | 1 << cur_ss`). Otherwise, the variables remain unchanged.***
