The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m` respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and `i` is 0. After executing the code, the values of `n`, `k`, and `m` are set to the integers provided by the input, while `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**
