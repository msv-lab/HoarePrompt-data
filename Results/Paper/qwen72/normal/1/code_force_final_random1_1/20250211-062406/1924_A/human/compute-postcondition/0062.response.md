Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters that caused `cur` to reset to 0. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is extended by `tmp` and a string of 'a' characters of length `(n - cnt - 1)`, where `tmp` is the character corresponding to the position `i` in the alphabet if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string.**
