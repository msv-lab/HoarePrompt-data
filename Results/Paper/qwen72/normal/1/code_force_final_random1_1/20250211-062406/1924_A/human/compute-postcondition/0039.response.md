Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution, `cur` is 0 if the last character processed caused `cur` to reset, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that were not part of a complete set of `k` unique characters, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters that caused `cur` to reset to 0, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string.**
