Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that were added when `cur` was reset to 0, `tmp` is 'c', `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in. The values of `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, `tmp`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. The condition about the bit at position `i` in `cur` being 0 is no longer relevant since the loop or if statement has been exited.
