The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least one more character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` must contain at least two characters, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must still contain at least one character, and `ss` will be the second character in the string `s`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must contain at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. `ss` is the second character in the string `s`.**
