Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cur` is reset to 0 if it reached `(1 << k) - 1` during any iteration, otherwise it holds the final value after processing all characters in `s`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is updated based on the conditions described, and `tmp` is the character corresponding to the bit position if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains the last character set or is an empty string if no bit was 0.**
