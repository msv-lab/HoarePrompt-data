Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least one more character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the next character of `s` minus 97, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `cur` to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur_ss`, `cnt`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- `cur` was previously updated based on the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, but now it is reset to 0.
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `ans` remains unchanged.
