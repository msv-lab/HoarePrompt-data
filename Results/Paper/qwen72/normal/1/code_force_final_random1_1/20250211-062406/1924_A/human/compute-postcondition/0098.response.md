Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'a'.** 

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `chr(ord('a') + i)` to `tmp`. Since `i` is 0, `ord('a') + i` evaluates to `ord('a')`, which is 97. The `chr` function converts 97 back to the character 'a'. Therefore, `tmp` is 'a'. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
