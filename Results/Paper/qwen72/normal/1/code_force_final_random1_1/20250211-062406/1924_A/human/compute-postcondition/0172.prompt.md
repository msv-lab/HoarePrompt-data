Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; for each test case, n, k, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    ans = ''
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
            ans += ss
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                break
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k-1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution, `cur` is 0 if the last character processed caused `cur` to reset, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that were not part of a complete set of `k` unique characters, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters that caused `cur` to reset to 0. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is extended by `tmp` and a string of 'a' characters of length `(n - cnt - 1)`, where `tmp` is the character corresponding to the position `i` in the alphabet if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string. The variable `cur` is reset to 0 if it reached `(1 << k) - 1` during any iteration, otherwise it holds the final value after processing all characters in `s`. The variable `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the variable `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`. Otherwise, `i` is `k-1`, `k` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is updated by appending `'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` to its current value, and `tmp` is the character corresponding to the bit position if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains the last character set or is an empty string if no bit was 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *After the loop executes all iterations, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, and `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that were added when `cur` was reset to 0. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, no additional changes are made. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is extended by the current value of `tmp` followed by `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times, where `tmp` is the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + (k-1))` if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains as it was (either an empty string or the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + i)`). Additionally, `i` is `k-1`, and if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
