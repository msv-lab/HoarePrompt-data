Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, and `tmp` is the character corresponding to the bit position if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains the last character set or is an empty string if no bit was 0.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the first character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is 0, `cnt` is increased by 1, and `ans` includes the first character of `s`. Otherwise, if the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0, then `cur` is updated to include the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the second character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1, `cur` is reset to 0, and `ans` includes the second character in `s`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the third character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character in `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ans` includes the third character in `s`. If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is reset to 0 and `ans` includes the third character in `s` repeated twice. Otherwise, if `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `1 << cur_ss`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
