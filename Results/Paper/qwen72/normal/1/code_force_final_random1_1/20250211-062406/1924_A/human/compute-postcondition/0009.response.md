Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must contain at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97 (which is the ASCII value of 'a'). Additionally, the bit corresponding to the position `cur_ss` in the integer `cur` is not set (i.e., `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`).**
