Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution, `cur` is 0 if the last character processed caused `cur` to reset, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that were not part of a complete set of `k` unique characters, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters that caused `cur` to reset to 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` remains unchanged as it is not used or modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `m` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `s` remains unchanged as it is the input string and is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `cnt` increments each time `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`, which means all `k` unique characters have been seen in the current set.
- The variable `cur` is reset to 0 each time `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`. Otherwise, it accumulates the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s`.
- The variable `ans` is updated with the characters that cause `cur` to reset to 0, meaning these characters complete a set of `k` unique characters.
