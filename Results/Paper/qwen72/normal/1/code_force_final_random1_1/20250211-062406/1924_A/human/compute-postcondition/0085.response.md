Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least one more character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the next character of `s` minus 97, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` if `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged.***
