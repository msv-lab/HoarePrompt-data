To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\).
   - `i` is `k-1`, where `k` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution.
   - `cur` is 0 if the last character processed caused `cur` to reset, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that were not part of a complete set of `k` unique characters.
   - `ans` is the concatenation of the characters that caused `cur` to reset to 0 plus `tmp` and a string of 'a' characters of length `(n - cnt - 1)`.
   - `cnt` is less than `n`.
   - If the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the position `i` in the alphabet (e.g., 'a' for 0, 'b' for 1, etc.), otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `cur` is a bitmask representing the presence of unique characters in the current window of size `k`.
   - When `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` unique characters have been seen, and `cur` resets to 0.
   - `cnt` counts how many times this reset happens.
   - `ans` is constructed by concatenating the characters that caused `cur` to reset, followed by `tmp`, and then a string of 'a' characters to make the total length `n`.

3. **Constructing `ans`:**
   - The characters that caused `cur` to reset are already part of `ans`.
   - `tmp` is added if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, which means the character at position `i` in the alphabet is added.
   - The remaining characters to reach the total length `n` are filled with 'a'.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the string `ans` as described above.

Given the complexity and the conditions, the precise output depends on the specific values of `s`, `k`, and `n`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the output will be a string of length `n` that includes the characters causing `cur` to reset, possibly an additional character from `tmp`, and the rest filled with 'a'.

Output: **[characters causing cur to reset][tmp if applicable]['a' * (n - cnt - 1)] (where the exact characters depend on the input string `s` and the value of `k`)**
