The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the value of `ss` to the string `ans`. Since `ans` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `ans` will contain the value of `ss`.

Given that `ss` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume `ss` is a variable that holds a string value. However, since the initial state mentions `cur_ss` as the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97, we can infer that `ss` might be a string representation of `cur_ss` or a related value. For simplicity, let's assume `ss` is a string.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least two characters, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is now equal to `ss`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97, `cur` is 0.**
