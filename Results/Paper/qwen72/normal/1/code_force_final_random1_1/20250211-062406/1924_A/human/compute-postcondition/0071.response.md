Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least one character, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97, `cur` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `cur = 0` sets the variable `cur` to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `cur_ss`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
