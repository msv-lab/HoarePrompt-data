Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans = ''` initializes the variable `ans` to an empty string.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial state specifies that `ans` should be the concatenation of characters that cause `cur` to reset to 0, but since `ans` is explicitly set to an empty string, this part of the initial state is overridden.
- The rest of the initial state remains valid and unchanged.
