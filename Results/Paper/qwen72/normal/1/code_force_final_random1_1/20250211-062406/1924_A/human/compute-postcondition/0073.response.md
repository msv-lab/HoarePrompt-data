Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `s`, and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
