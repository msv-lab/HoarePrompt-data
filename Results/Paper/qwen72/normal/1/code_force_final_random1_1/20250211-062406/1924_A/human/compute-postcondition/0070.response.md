Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least one character, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97 (which is the ASCII value of 'a'), and `cur` is a number where the bit at position `cur_ss` in the binary representation of `cur` is 1. Additionally, `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, meaning all bits from position 0 to `k-1` in the binary representation of `cur` are set to 1.**
