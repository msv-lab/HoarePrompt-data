Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 1 << (`ord(s[0]) - 97`), `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97 (which is the ASCII value of 'a'). Additionally, the bit at position `cur_ss` in the binary representation of `cur` is now 1.**
