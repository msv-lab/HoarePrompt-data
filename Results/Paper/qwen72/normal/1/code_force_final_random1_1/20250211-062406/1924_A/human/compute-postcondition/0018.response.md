Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must contain at least two characters, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is 0, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `cur_ss = ord(s[1]) - ord('a')` updates the value of `cur_ss` to the ASCII value of the second character of the string `s` minus 97.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `cur`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
