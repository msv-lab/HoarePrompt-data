Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least one more character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the next character of `s` minus 97, `cur` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The line `cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')` calculates the ASCII value of the next character of `s` minus 97 and assigns it to `cur_ss`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
