Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains a sequence of characters that collectively cover all `k` distinct alphabets at least `n` times. If such a sequence exists, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string `ans` that includes the missing characters to meet the requirement, appending the necessary characters to ensure the sequence is valid. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. **
