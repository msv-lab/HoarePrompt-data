Based on the initial state provided:

- `cur` is 0 after the loop executes all iterations.
- `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met.
- `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that were added when `cur` was reset to 0.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Given this information, the `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
