Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least two characters, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97, `cur` is 0.** 

Explanation: The code initializes `cur` to 0, which overrides any previous value it might have had. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
