Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `time` is 1, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `elements`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.** 

Explanation: The variable `nxt` is assigned the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, which is calculated based on the values of `pos` and `mov[com]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
