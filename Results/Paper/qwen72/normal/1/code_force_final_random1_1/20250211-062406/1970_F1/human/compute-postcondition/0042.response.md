Postcondition: **`n` and `m` remain integers read from input and satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd, `grid` is now a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the updated `line`, `elements` is a dictionary that contains entries for each unique non-'..' string in `line`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains entries for each player string (as determined by the `isPlayer` function) found in `line`, `goal` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains tuples (0, index) for each string in `line` that ends with 'G' and starts with 'B', and the second list contains tuples (0, index) for each string in `line` that ends with 'G' and starts with 'R', `points` remains a list `[0, 0]`, `i` is 0, `line` is updated to a list of strings read from the input and must have at least one element, `ind` is 0, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..'.**
