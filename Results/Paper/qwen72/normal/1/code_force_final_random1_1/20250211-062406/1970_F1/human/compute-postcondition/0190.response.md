Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged. If `isPlayer(obj)` is true, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` before the update, `nxt` is (`pos[0]` + `mov[com][0]`, `pos[1]` + `mov[com][1]`), and `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`. If `isPlayer(obj)` is false, `pos` remains the value of `elements[obj]` and `nxt` is (`pos[0]` + `mov[com][0]`, `pos[1]` + `mov[com][1]`).***
