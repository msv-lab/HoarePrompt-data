Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers satisfying 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd. `grid` is a list containing three elements: the original `line`, the updated `line`, and the new `line` read from input. `elements` is a dictionary that contains entries for each unique non-'..' string in `line`. `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains entries for each player string found in `line`. `goal` is a list containing tuples for specific strings in `line`. `points` is a list `[0, 0]`. `i` is 1. `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least three elements. `ind` is `len(line)`. If `line[ind]` is not '..': `elements` includes an entry for `line[ind]` which is `(1, len(line))`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. Otherwise, if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(1, len(line))`. If `line[ind]` is '..': no changes are made to any variables.***
