Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is (`pos[0]` + `mov[com][0]`, `pos[1]` + `mov[com][1]`), `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `player` is updated based on the condition `isPlayer(obj)`.
- If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, then `player` is set to `obj`.
- If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `False`, then `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `time`, `command`, `obj`, `com`, `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `mov`, `grid`, `pos`, `nxt`) remain unchanged.
