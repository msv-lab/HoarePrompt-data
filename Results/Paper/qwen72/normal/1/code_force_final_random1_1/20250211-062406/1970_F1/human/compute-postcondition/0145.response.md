Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `time` is 1, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is ".Q", `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. If `el` is ".S", `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is set to 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `el` is neither ".Q" nor ".S", the state remains unchanged. If `len(command) != 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` before the update, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is `.B`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player, then `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `obj` is not `.B`, the state remains unchanged.

Given Code:
```
command = stdin.readline().strip().split()
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. The code reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings.
2. This list of strings is assigned to the variable `command`.
3. The initial state mentions that `command` is already a list of strings read from standard input, so this operation updates the value of `command`.

Impact on Variables:
- `command` is updated to the new list of strings read from standard input.
- Other variables (`t`, `time`, `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `elements`, `mov`, `grid`, `player`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `time` is 1, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `elements`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged.**
