Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `time` is 1, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers` now has `obj` set to `True`. If `el` is '.S', `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `len(command) != 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj == '.B'`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
