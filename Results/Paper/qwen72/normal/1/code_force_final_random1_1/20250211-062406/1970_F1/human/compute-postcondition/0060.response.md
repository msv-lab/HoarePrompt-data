Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` remain integers read from input and satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd. `grid` is now a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the updated `line`. `elements` is a dictionary that contains entries for each unique non-'..' string in `line`. `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains entries for each player string (as determined by the `isPlayer` function) found in `line`. `goal` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains tuples (0, index) for each string in `line` that ends with 'G' and starts with 'B', and the second list contains tuples (0, index) for each string in `line` that ends with 'G' and starts with 'R'. `points` remains a list `[0, 0]`, `i` is 0, `line` is updated to a list of strings read from the input and must have at least one element, `ind` is 1. If `line[1]` is not '..', `elements` now includes the entry for `line[1]` which is `(0, 1)`. If `line[1]` is a player string, the value for `line[1]` in `allPlayers` is now `False`. If `line[1]` is not a player string and ends with 'G', the second list of `goal` now includes the tuple (0, 1). If `line[1]` ends with 'G', the tuple (0, 1) is appended to `goal[tmp]`, where `tmp` is 0 if `line[1]` starts with 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. If `line[1]` is '..', none of these updates occur.***
