The code snippet assigns the value of `elements[obj]` to the variable `pos`. Since `obj` is the first element of `command`, and assuming `elements` is a dictionary or list where `obj` is a valid key or index, `pos` will now hold the value associated with `obj` in `elements`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`.**
