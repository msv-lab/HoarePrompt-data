Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is ".Q", `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. If `el` is ".S", `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is set to 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `el` is neither ".Q" nor ".S", the state remains unchanged. If `len(command) != 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` before the update, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is `.B`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player, then `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `obj` is not `.B`, the state remains unchanged.***
