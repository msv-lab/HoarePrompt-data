Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `time` is 0, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` before the update, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is `.B` and `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player, or if `obj` is a player and `elements['.B']` is `nxt`, then `player` is `obj` if `obj` is a player, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. Otherwise, if `com` is 'T' and `pos` is within a goal area (i.e., `goalIn(pos)` is not -1), then `team` is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`, and `points[team]` is increased by 1. If `com` is not 'T' and `obj` is a player, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `com` is 'T' but `pos` is not within a goal area, the state remains unchanged.***
