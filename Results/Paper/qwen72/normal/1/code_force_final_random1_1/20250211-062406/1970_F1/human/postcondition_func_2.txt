The function `isPlayer` accepts a parameter `el`, which is expected to be a string of length 2. The first character of `el` should be either 'B' or 'R', and the second character should be a digit from '0' to '9'. The function returns `True` if the first character is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G'. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
