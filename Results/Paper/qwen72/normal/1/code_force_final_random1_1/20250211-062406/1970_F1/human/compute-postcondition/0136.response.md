Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` before the update, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`. Additionally, either `obj` is not equal to `.B` or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is not a player, and either `obj` is not a player or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`. The command `com` is not 'T'. The current value of `obj` is a player.**

Explanation:
- The value of `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.
- All other variables (`t`, `time`, `obj`, `com`, `pos`, `nxt`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions regarding `obj`, `com`, and the grid remain valid as they were in the initial state.
