Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers satisfying 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd. `grid` is a list containing three elements: the original `line`, the updated `line`, and the new `line` read from input. `elements` is a dictionary that contains entries for each unique non-'..' string in `line` including the entry for `line[ind]` with the value `(1, ind)`. `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains entries for each player string found in `line`, with the entry for `line[ind]` set to `False`. `goal` is a list containing tuples for specific strings in `line`. `points` is a list `[0, 0]`. `i` is 1. `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least one element. `ind` is the last index of `line` (i.e., `len(line) - 1`). The last element of `line` (i.e., `line[ind]`) is not equal to '..' and is a player string.**
