Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `time` is 1.
   - `command` is a list of strings read from standard input.
   - `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `elements`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`.
   - `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
   - `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`.
   - `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `team` is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`. Since `pos` is the position of the object `obj` in the `elements` dictionary, `team` will be the team identifier returned by `goalIn(pos)`.
   - `GoalName` is assumed to be a dictionary or list where the keys or indices correspond to team identifiers, and the values are the names of the teams.
   - The print statement will format the output as `'%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team])`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The time is 1.
   - The team name is determined by `GoalName[team]`, where `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`.
   - Therefore, the output will be `1 <team_name> GOAL`, where `<team_name>` is the name of the team corresponding to the value of `team` in the `GoalName` dictionary or list.

Output: **1 <team_name> GOAL (where <team_name> is the name of the team corresponding to the value of `team` in the `GoalName` dictionary or list)**
