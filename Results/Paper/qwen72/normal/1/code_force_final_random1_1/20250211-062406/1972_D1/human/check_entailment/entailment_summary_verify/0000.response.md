### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues with the provided program:

1. **Function `func_15`**:
   - The function `func_15` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - However, the logic inside `func_15` is completely unrelated to the problem statement. It performs a loop that increments `i` and updates `ans` based on a division operation, which does not correspond to the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_16`**:
   - The function `func_16` reads the number of test cases using `func_10()` and then calls `func_15()` for each test case, printing the result.
   - Since `func_15` itself is incorrect, the results printed by `func_16` will also be incorrect.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds.
   - The current implementation does not perform this check and thus is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The logic in `func_15` is unrelated to the required conditions for the pairs \((a, b)\), and therefore, the program is incorrect.
