The only object in the loop head is the result of `func_10()`. The loop's execution depends on this value. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `func_10()` must have returned a value greater than 0, and the result of `func_15()` was printed to the console. For the loop to execute again, `func_10()` must still return a value greater than 0.

Since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's condition, it does not need to be adjusted. The only thing that needs to remain true is that `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, the result of `func_15()` is printed to the console.**
