The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` writes the result of `func_15()` to the console followed by a newline character. The function `func_15()` is called, and its result is converted to a string before being written to the console. The initial state specifies that the result of `func_15()` is printed to the console, which aligns with what this code does.

Since `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, this condition remains unchanged by the code snippet provided. No new variables are introduced, and no existing variables are modified by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, the result of `func_15()` is printed to the console.**
