The provided code snippet writes the result of `func_15()` to the standard output followed by a newline character. Since the initial state specifies that `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, this condition remains unchanged as the code does not affect `func_10()`. However, the output of `func_15()` is written to the console, but its value is not stored in any variable.

Output State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, the result of `func_15()` is printed to the console.**
