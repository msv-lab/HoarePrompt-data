Output State: **The loop will execute `func_10()` times, printing the result of `func_15()` to the console on each iteration.**

### Explanation:
- The loop will run as many times as the value returned by `func_10()`.
- On each iteration, the result of `func_15()` is printed to the console.
- After all iterations, the loop will have completed its execution, and the console will contain the output from each call to `func_15()`, one per line.
