Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the core logic in `func_15` is flawed and does not align with the problem's requirements. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling Functions**:
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`, `func_8`, `func_9`, `func_10`, and `func_11` are utility functions for reading input. They are correctly implemented and serve their purpose of handling input in various formats.

2. **Core Logic Function**:
   - `func_15` is the main function responsible for solving the problem. Let's analyze it in detail:
     ```python
     def func_15():
         (n, m) = func_7()
         i = 1
         ans = 0
         while i * i <= n + i:
             ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
             i += 1
         return ans - 1
     ```
   - **Input Reading**: `(n, m) = func_7()` correctly reads the values of \(n\) and \(m\).
   - **Loop and Calculation**:
     - The loop `while i * i <= n + i` iterates over possible values of \(i\).
     - The calculation `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` is not related to the problem's requirement. The problem requires counting pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current logic does not perform this check.
     - The final `return ans - 1` is also arbitrary and does not align with the problem statement.

3. **Main Function**:
   - `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case:
     ```python
     def func_16():
         for _ in range(func_10()):
             sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
     ```
   - This function correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.

### Correctness Check:
- The core logic in `func_15` is incorrect. The loop and the calculation inside `func_15` do not match the mathematical requirement of the problem.
- The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), which is not done in the provided code.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_15` is incorrect and does not follow the required conditions.

Final: **False**
