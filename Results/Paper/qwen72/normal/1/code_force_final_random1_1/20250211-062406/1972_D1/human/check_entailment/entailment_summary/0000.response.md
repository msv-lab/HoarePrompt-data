### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_10()**: Reads the number of test cases \(t\) from the input.
   - **func_15()**: This function is supposed to solve the problem for a single test case. It reads \(n\) and \(m\) from the input, and then calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - **func_16()**: This function runs the solution for each test case and prints the results.

3. **func_15() Analysis**:
   - The function reads \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7()`.
   - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates while \(i^2 \le n + i\), and for each \(i\), it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_15()` does not seem to correctly implement the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The loop and the calculation inside `func_15()` do not align with the problem statement. The problem requires checking pairs \((a, b)\) and verifying the condition, but the function seems to be doing something entirely different.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False****
