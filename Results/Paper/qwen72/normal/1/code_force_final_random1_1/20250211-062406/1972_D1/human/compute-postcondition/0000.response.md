To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for _ in range(func_10()):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Objects in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is a dummy variable) and the result of the function call `func_10()`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `range(func_10())` returns a non-empty range. This means that `func_10()` must return a positive integer (greater than 0).

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since no input parameters are provided to `func_16`, we cannot adjust any input parameters.
   - We need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`. For the loop to execute, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0**
