Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `k` is 14, and `ind[0]` is the index of the element in `a` that is greater than `x`. Since `ind[0]` is less than or equal to `k` and not 0, the program calculates the difference between `k` and `ind[0]` and the difference between `ind[0]` and 1, and returns the larger of these two differences.**
