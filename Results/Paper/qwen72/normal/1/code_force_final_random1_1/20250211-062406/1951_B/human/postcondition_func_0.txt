The function `func_1` takes a list `a` of unique integers as input and returns an integer based on the following logic: It checks for elements in `a` that are greater than a specific element `x` (where `x` is `a[k]` and `k` is 14). Depending on the number of such elements found, the function returns one of several values: `n - 1` if no such elements are found, 13 if the only element found is at index 0, `ind[0] - 1` if the first found element's index is greater than `k`, the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1` if the first found element's index is less than or equal to `k`, the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1` if the first found element is at index 0 and a second element is found, the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]` if the first found element's index is not 0 and `k` is greater than the second found element's index, or the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]` if the first found element's index is not 0 and `k` is less than or equal to the second found element's index.
