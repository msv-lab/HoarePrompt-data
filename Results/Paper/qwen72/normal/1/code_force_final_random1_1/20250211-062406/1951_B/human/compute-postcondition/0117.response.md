Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `s`. If `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `z` remains unchanged. If `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is increased by 1 and `z` remains 1. If `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is not 1, `ans1` and `z` remain unchanged.***
