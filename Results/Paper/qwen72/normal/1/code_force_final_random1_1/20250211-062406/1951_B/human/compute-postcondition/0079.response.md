To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `n` and `k` are assigned the integer values from the input.
- `s` is a list of integers from the input with at least 2 elements.
- The first element of `s` (s[0]) and the `k-1`th element of `s` (s[k-1]) have been swapped.
- `ans` is 0 if `h` is less than `i`, otherwise `ans` is 1.
- `h` is the value of the first element of `s` (s[0]).
- `j` is 0.
- `i` is `s[1]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in s[1:]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements of `s` starting from the second element (`s[1]`).
- The loop variable `i` is updated to the next element in the list `s` at each iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be set to the next element in the list `s`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Current State**: `i` is `s[1]`.
2. **Next State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be set to the next element in the list `s`, which is `s[2]`.

### Final State:
- All other variables remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned the integer values from the input, `s` is a list of integers from the input with at least 2 elements, the first element of `s` (s[0]) and the `k-1`th element of `s` (s[k-1]) have been swapped, `ans` is 0 if `h` is less than `i`, otherwise `ans` is 1, `h` is the value of the first element of `s` (s[0]), `j` is 0, and `i` is `s[2]`.**
