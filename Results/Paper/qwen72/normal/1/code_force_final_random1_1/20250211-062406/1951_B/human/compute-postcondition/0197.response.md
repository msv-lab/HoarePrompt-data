Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by the number of cows (n), the index of your cow (k), and a list of Cowdeforces ratings (a). It calculates and prints the maximum number of cows whose ratings are less than or equal to your cow's rating when your cow is moved to the front of the list, either directly or by swapping with another cow. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without retaining any state from the processed test cases. **
