Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `s`. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1, and `z` is 1 if `i` is equal to `h`. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement (but this does not affect the current code snippet). If `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` was previously increased by 1. If `s[0]` is equal to `h`, `ans1` and `z` remain unchanged.***
