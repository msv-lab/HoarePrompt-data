Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each element a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[k]`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2. If `a[2]` > `x`, `ind` is a list containing the index 2, and `c` is 3. Otherwise, `ind` is an empty list and `c` is 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
