Output State: **`s` is a list of integers with its first element (`s[0]`) and the element at index `k-1` swapped, `i` is the last element checked in `s` (or `s[-1]` if the loop completes without breaking), `j` is the index of the last element checked in `s` (or `len(s) - 2` if the loop completes without breaking), `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and meet the condition `h >= i` before encountering an element greater than `h`, `p` is equal to `j`.**

Explanation:
- The code swaps the first element (`s[0]`) and the element at index `k-1` in the list `s`.
- The values of `i`, `j`, `ans`, and `p` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
