Output State: **The program returns a list `resultats` containing `t` elements, where each element corresponds to the result of the respective tuple in `cas_de_test`. Each element in `resultats` is calculated based on the conditions specified: if the sum of the tuple elements is odd, the result is `-1`; if the sum is even, further checks are made to determine if the result should be `-1` or the calculated value of `egalites` divided by 2.**
