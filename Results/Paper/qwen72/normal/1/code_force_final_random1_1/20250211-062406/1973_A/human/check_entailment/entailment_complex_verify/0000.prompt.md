You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples with `t` tuples, and `resultats` is a list containing `t` elements. Each element in `resultats` corresponds to the result of the respective tuple in `cas_de_test`. For each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in `cas_de_test`:
    #- If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` (`total_points`) is odd, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `-1`.
    #- If `total_points` is even, `total_matchs` is calculated as `total_points // 2`. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `-1`.
    #- If neither of the above conditions is met, `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` is less than 0, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `-1`. Otherwise, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `egalites // 2`.
    return resultats
    #The program returns a list `resultats` containing `t` elements, where each element corresponds to the result of the respective tuple in `cas_de_test`. Each element in `resultats` is calculated based on the conditions specified: if the sum of the tuple elements is odd, the result is `-1`; if the sum is even, further checks are made to determine if the result should be `-1` or the calculated value of `egalites` divided by 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list `cas_de_test` of `t` tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of three players. The function returns a list `resultats` of length `t`, where each element corresponds to the result of the respective tuple in `cas_de_test`. For each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in `cas_de_test`:
- If the sum of the scores (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is odd, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `-1`.
- If the sum is even, the function calculates `total_matchs` as half of the sum. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `-1`.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, the function calculates `egalites` as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` is less than 0, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `-1`. Otherwise, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `egalites // 2`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in how it calculates the maximum number of draws. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `egalites` is incorrect:

```python
egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
```

This formula does not correctly account for the distribution of points in a way that maximizes the number of draws. 

### Counterexample:
Consider the input `(0, 2, 3)`:
- According to the problem, the total points are `0 + 2 + 3 = 5`. Since the total points must be even for a valid set of games, this input should result in `-1`.
- However, the program incorrectly calculates `total_matchs` as `5 // 2 = 2`, and then proceeds to calculate `egalites` as `5 - 2 * (3 - 2) - 2 * (3 - 0) = 5 - 2 - 6 = -3`, which is less than 0, so it returns `-1`.

While the program correctly identifies that the input is invalid, it does so for the wrong reason. The issue is that the formula for `egalites` is flawed and does not correctly handle all cases.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the total points are even and that the points can be distributed in a way that maximizes the number of draws. A correct approach would involve checking if the total points are even and then calculating the maximum number of draws based on the distribution of points.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it uses a flawed formula to calculate the number of draws, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
