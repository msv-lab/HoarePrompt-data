Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `total_points` is equal to the sum of the elements of the next tuple (p1 + p2 + p3), `resultats` is a list containing `-1`, `total_matchs` is equal to the sum of the next tuple's elements divided by 2, `egalites` is equal to the sum of the next tuple's elements minus 2 * (next p3 - next p2) - 2 * (next p3 - next p1). The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but continues to the next iteration of the loop or skips the rest of the current loop body.**
