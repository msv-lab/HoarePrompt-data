The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement would not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `resultats` is a list containing one element which is -1, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, and the current value of `total_points` is odd.**
