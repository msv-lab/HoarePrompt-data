Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `total_points` is equal to the sum of the elements of the next tuple (p1 + p2 + p3), `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, and `resultats` is a list. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` contains `-1` and the current iteration is skipped.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `total_matchs = total_points // 2` assigns the value of `total_points // 2` to the variable `total_matchs`.
- Since `total_points` is already defined as the sum of the elements of the next tuple (p1 + p2 + p3), the value of `total_matchs` is updated to be the integer division of `total_points` by 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `cas_de_test`, `total_points`, `egalites`, and `resultats`) remain unchanged.
- The condition about `resultats` containing `-1` and skipping the current iteration if `total_points` is odd remains valid, as it is not affected by the code snippet.
