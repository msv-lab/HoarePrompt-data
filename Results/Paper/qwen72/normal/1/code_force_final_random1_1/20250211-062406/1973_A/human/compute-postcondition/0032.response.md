Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `total_points` is equal to the sum of the elements of the next tuple (p1 + p2 + p3), `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list containing either `-1` or the value `egalites // 2` based on the conditions.**

Explanation:
- The code `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3` assigns the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` to the variable `total_points`.
- Since `total_points` is now explicitly defined as `p1 + p2 + p3`, the other variables (`total_matchs`, `egalites`, and `resultats`) that depend on `total_points` remain unchanged in their definitions.
- The initial state remains valid, and no new information changes the values of `t`, `cas_de_test`, `total_matchs`, `egalites`, or `resultats`.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `total_points` while maintaining the rest of the initial state.
