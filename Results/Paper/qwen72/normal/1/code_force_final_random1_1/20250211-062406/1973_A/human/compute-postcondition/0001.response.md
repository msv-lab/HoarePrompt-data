To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects directly involved in the loop head, which are `(p1, p2, p3)` and `cas_de_test`.

1. **`cas_de_test`**: This is the list being iterated over. For the loop to execute, `cas_de_test` must contain at least one tuple.
2. **`(p1, p2, p3)`**: These are the variables that will be unpacked from each tuple in `cas_de_test`. They do not need to be explicitly initialized before the loop, as they will be assigned values from the tuples during each iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), representing the number of test cases.
- `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30).
- `resultats` is an empty list.

To ensure the loop can execute, `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple. The other variables (`t` and `resultats`) do not affect the loop's ability to execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `resultats` is an empty list**
