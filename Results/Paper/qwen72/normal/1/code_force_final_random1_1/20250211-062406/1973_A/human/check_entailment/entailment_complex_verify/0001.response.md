### Reasoning:

1. **Total Points Check**:
   - The code correctly checks if the total points (`total_points`) is odd using `total_points % 2 != 0`. If the total points are odd, the result is `-1` because the total points must be even (each game contributes 2 points, either from a win or a draw).

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The code correctly calculates the total number of matches as `total_matchs = total_points // 2`. This is correct because each match contributes 2 points to the total score.

3. **Feasibility Check**:
   - The code checks if the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if the highest score (`p3`) is greater than the total number of matches. This is necessary because:
     - A maximum of 3 matches can be played among 3 players.
     - The highest score cannot exceed the total number of matches.
   - The condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` is correct and necessary to ensure the scores are feasible.

4. **Draws Calculation**:
   - The formula used to calculate the number of draws is:
     - `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`
   - This formula attempts to account for the points that are not from wins (i.e., points from draws). However, it may not be accurate in all cases. Specifically, it assumes that the points difference between the highest and the other two scores is entirely due to wins, which might not always be true.

5. **Negative Draws Check**:
   - The code ensures that the number of draws is non-negative by checking `if egalites < 0`. This is a necessary check to avoid invalid results.

6. **Final Result**:
   - The number of draws is divided by 2 to get the actual number of draw matches, which is then appended to the results list. This is correct because each draw contributes 2 points.

### Re-evaluation of the Draws Calculation Formula:
- The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` might not correctly account for all possible scenarios where the points distribution might be valid but the formula gives an incorrect number of draws.
- A more robust approach would be to calculate the maximum number of draws by ensuring that the remaining points after accounting for the minimum number of wins are distributed as draws.

### Corrected Approach:
- Calculate the minimum number of wins required to achieve the scores.
- Subtract the points from wins from the total points to get the points from draws.
- Ensure the number of draws is non-negative and feasible.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the logical issue with the draws calculation formula.
- The current implementation has a logical issue in the formula for calculating draws, which might lead to incorrect results in some cases.

### Final: **False**
