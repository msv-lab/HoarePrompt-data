### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by iterating over each test case in the `cas_de_test` list. Each test case is a tuple of three integers representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Total Points Calculation**: The program calculates the total points for each test case using `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`. This is correct because the total points must be the sum of all individual scores.

3. **Odd Total Points Check**: The program checks if `total_points` is odd. If it is, the result is `-1` because the total points must be even for the scores to be achievable through a series of games (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss scenario or 2 points in a draw scenario).

4. **Total Matches Calculation**: The program calculates `total_matchs` as `total_points // 2`. This is correct because each match (whether a win/loss or a draw) contributes 2 points to the total.

5. **Invalid Total Matches Check**: The program checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`. This check is necessary because:
   - There can be at most 3 matches if all three players play against each other once.
   - The highest score `p3` cannot exceed the total number of matches.

6. **Draws Calculation**: The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula is derived from the fact that the difference in points between the highest and the other players can be attributed to wins and losses. The remaining points are attributed to draws.

7. **Final Check and Result**: The program checks if `egalites` is negative. If it is, the result is `-1` because a negative number of draws is not possible. Otherwise, the result is `egalites // 2`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or return `-1` if the scores are inconsistent. The conditions and calculations are logically sound and align with the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
