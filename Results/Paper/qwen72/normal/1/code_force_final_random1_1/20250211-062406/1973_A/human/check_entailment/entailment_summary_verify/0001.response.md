### Reasoning:

1. **Total Points Check**:
   - The total points must be even because each game (whether a win/loss or a draw) contributes 2 points to the total score. The code correctly checks this with `total_points % 2 != 0`.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The total number of matches is calculated as `total_points // 2`. This is correct because each match contributes 2 points to the total score.

3. **Feasibility Check**:
   - The code checks if the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if the highest score (`p3`) is greater than the total number of matches. This is necessary because:
     - A maximum of 3 matches can be played among 3 players.
     - The highest score cannot exceed the total number of matches.
   - The condition `if total_matchs > 3` is indeed too strict. However, the next condition `if p3 > total_matchs` covers the necessary check, so the combined condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` is redundant. The code should only check `if p3 > total_matchs`.

4. **Draws Calculation**:
   - The formula used to calculate the number of draws is:
     - `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`
   - This formula attempts to account for the points that are not from wins (i.e., points from draws).
   - The formula is derived from the idea that the points from wins are `2 * (p3 - p2) + 2 * (p3 - p1)`, and the remaining points are from draws.
   - However, this formula might not be accurate in all cases. For example, it assumes that the points from wins are always distributed in a specific way, which might not be true.

5. **Negative Draws Check**:
   - The code ensures that the number of draws is non-negative by checking `if egalites < 0`.

6. **Final Result**:
   - The number of draws is divided by 2 to get the actual number of draw matches, which is then appended to the results list.

### Re-evaluation of the Formula for Draws:
- The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` needs to be re-evaluated.
- A more robust approach would be to consider the maximum possible number of draws while ensuring that the remaining points can be distributed as wins.

### Corrected Logic:
- Calculate the total number of matches as `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.
- Ensure that `p3 <= total_matchs`.
- Calculate the maximum possible number of draws by ensuring that the remaining points can be distributed as wins.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        # Calculate the maximum possible number of draws
        max_wins = (p3 - p1) + (p3 - p2)
        max_draws = total_matchs - max_wins
        if max_draws < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(max_draws)
    return resultats
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment identified a logical issue in the feasibility check and the formula for calculating draws.
- The corrected logic ensures that the maximum number of draws is calculated correctly while ensuring the remaining points can be distributed as wins.
- The corrected code addresses the issues identified in the original assessment.
