Reasoning:

1. **Total Points Check**: The total points must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (if not a draw) or 2 points (if a draw). This is correctly checked in the code with `total_points % 2 != 0`.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**: The total number of matches is calculated as `total_points // 2`. This is correct because each match contributes 2 points to the total score.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The code checks if the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if the highest score (`p3`) is greater than the total number of matches. This is necessary because:
   - A maximum of 3 matches can be played among 3 players.
   - The highest score cannot exceed the total number of matches.

4. **Draws Calculation**: The formula used to calculate the number of draws is:
   - `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`
   - This formula attempts to account for the points that are not from wins (i.e., points from draws).

5. **Negative Draws Check**: The code ensures that the number of draws is non-negative by checking `if egalites < 0`.

6. **Final Result**: The number of draws is divided by 2 to get the actual number of draw matches, which is then appended to the results list.

However, there is a logical issue in the feasibility check:
- The condition `if total_matchs > 3` is too strict. It should be `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs`, but this is already covered in the next condition `if p3 > total_matchs`.

Additionally, the formula for calculating draws might not be accurate in all cases. For example, the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` does not correctly account for all possible scenarios where the points distribution might be valid but the formula gives an incorrect number of draws.

Let's re-evaluate the logic for calculating draws:
- The maximum number of draws can be calculated by ensuring that the remaining points after accounting for the minimum number of wins are distributed as draws.

Given these considerations, the current implementation has some logical issues that need to be addressed.

Correctness: **False**
