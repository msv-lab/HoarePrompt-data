Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. It iterates through each sign's periodicity, updating the year based on the next occurrence of the sign after the previous year. The logic `year += year % ai or ai` ensures that if the current year is not a multiple of `ai`, it adds the remainder to reach the next multiple of `ai`. This correctly simulates the sequential occurrence of signs as described in the problem statement. No edge cases or inputs have been identified that would cause the program to fail.
