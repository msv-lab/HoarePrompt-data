Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements, `test` is the second element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `current_year`, `n` is the first item of `test`, `a` is the second item of `test` and must contain at least four elements. `ai` is the fourth element of `a`. If `current_year % ai == 0`, `current_year` is updated to `current_year + ai`, and `next_year` is set to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `current_year` is updated to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, and `next_year` is set to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.***
