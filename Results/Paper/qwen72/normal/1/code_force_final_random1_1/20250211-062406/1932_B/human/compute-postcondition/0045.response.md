Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements, `test` is the second element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `current_year`, `n` is the first item of `test`, `a` is the second item of `test`, and `current_year` is the final value of `next_year` after all iterations of the loop. The value of `current_year` will be the smallest multiple of the largest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a` that are not multiples of any smaller element in `a`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `ai` in the list `a`.
- For each `ai`, if `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, `next_year` is set to `current_year + ai`.
- If `current_year` is not divisible by `ai`, `next_year` is set to the next multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
- After all iterations, `current_year` will be the smallest multiple of the largest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a` that are not multiples of any smaller element in `a`.
- The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `test`, `results`, `n`, `a`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
