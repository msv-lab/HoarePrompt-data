The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ai` and the iterable `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is the second item of the third element of `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable, and `ai` is the current element being processed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still be an iterable with at least one more element remaining, and `ai` will be the next element in this iterable.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, `test` is the third element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where both elements are `next_year`, `n` is the first item of the third element of `test_cases`, `a` is the second item of the third element of `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `ai` is the next element in `a`**
