The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition but is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The function should return the results for each test case.

However, since the function signature does not explicitly include these parameters, it's implied that they might be passed through other means (e.g., global variables, file input, etc.), but for the purpose of this description, we'll focus on the expected behavior based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the result for each test case based on the periodicities of the signs.**
