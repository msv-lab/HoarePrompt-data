The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ai` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, and `ai` is the second element of the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `ai` will be the third element of the list `a`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 3 elements, `year` is equal to `ai`, `ai` is the third element of the list `a`**
