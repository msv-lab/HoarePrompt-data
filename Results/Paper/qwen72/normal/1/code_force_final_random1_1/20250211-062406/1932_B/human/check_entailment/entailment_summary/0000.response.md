Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the rules that each sign must occur sequentially after the previous one. The logic used in the program is to iterate through the list of periodicities (`a`) and update the `year` variable by adding either `year % ai` or `ai` depending on whether `year % ai` is zero or not. This approach is intended to ensure that the next sign occurs strictly after the current year.

However, this logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for the sequential nature of the signs. Specifically, the expression `year % ai or ai` does not always give the correct next year for the sign to occur. Instead, the correct approach should be to find the next multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current `year`.

To fix this, the correct way to update the `year` would be to use the formula:
\[ \text{next\_year} = \left( \left\lceil \frac{\text{year}}{\text{ai}} \right\rceil \times \text{ai} \right) \]
This ensures that the next sign occurs at the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current `year`.

Given the current implementation, the program will not always produce the correct year for the n-th sign to occur, especially when the signs do not align perfectly with the current year.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
