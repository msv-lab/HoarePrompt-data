You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of signs. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        
        print(year)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0, `n` has been an input integer for each test case, `a` has been a list of integers from user input with `n` elements for each test case, and `year` is the sum of `(year % ai or ai)` for each `ai` in `a` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates a value `year` by summing up `(year % ai or ai)` for each element `ai` in `a`. The function prints the calculated `year` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and no further state is maintained.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the year when the nth sign occurs, given that each sign \(i\) occurs every \(a_i\) years.
   - The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the \(i\)-th sign must occur strictly after the \((i-1)\)-th sign.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `year` to 0.
   - For each sign \(a_i\), it updates the `year` by adding the remainder of `year` divided by \(a_i\) or \(a_i\) itself if the remainder is zero.
   - This ensures that the next sign occurs at the next multiple of \(a_i\) after the current `year`.

3. **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
   - **Initialization:** `year = 0`
   - **Loop through each sign \(a_i\):**
     - Calculate `year % ai` to find the remainder.
     - If `year % ai` is 0, add `ai` to `year` (this means the next occurrence of the sign is exactly `ai` years from now).
     - If `year % ai` is not 0, add `year % ai` to `year` (this means the next occurrence of the sign is the next multiple of `ai` after the current `year`).

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `3 2 4 5 9 18`:
     - Start with `year = 0`.
     - First sign (3): `year = 0 + 3 = 3`.
     - Second sign (2): `year = 3 + 1 = 4` (since 3 % 2 = 1).
     - Third sign (4): `year = 4 + 4 = 8` (since 4 % 4 = 0).
     - Fourth sign (5): `year = 8 + 2 = 10` (since 8 % 5 = 2).
     - Fifth sign (9): `year = 10 + 8 = 18` (since 10 % 9 = 8).
     - Sixth sign (18): `year = 18 + 18 = 36` (since 18 % 18 = 0).

   - The final `year` is 36, which matches the expected output.

5. **Generalization:**
   - The logic works for any sequence of signs because it correctly calculates the next multiple of each \(a_i\) after the current `year`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year when the nth sign occurs, ensuring that each sign occurs sequentially as required.
