The code appends the value of `current_year` to the list `results`. The value of `current_year` is the smallest multiple of the largest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a` that are not multiples of any smaller element in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements, `test` is the second element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `current_year` and the second element is also `current_year`, `n` is the first item of `test`, `a` is the second item of `test`, and `current_year` is the final value of `next_year` after all iterations of the loop. The value of `current_year` is the smallest multiple of the largest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a` that are not multiples of any smaller element in `a`.**
