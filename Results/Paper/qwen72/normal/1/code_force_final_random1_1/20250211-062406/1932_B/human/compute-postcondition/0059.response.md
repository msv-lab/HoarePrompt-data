The code snippet `next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai` updates the value of `next_year` based on the current values of `current_year` and `ai`. Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
   - `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements.
   - `test` is the third element of `test_cases`.
   - `results` is a list containing two elements where both elements are `current_year`.
   - `n` is the first item of the third element of `test_cases`.
   - `a` is the second item of the third element of `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable.
   - `current_year` is equal to `next_year`.
   - `next_year` is set to the first item (`ai`) of the iterable `a` if `current_year` was divisible by `ai`; otherwise, `next_year` is set to `ai` and `current_year % ai` is not equal to 0.
   - `ai` is the second item of the iterable `a`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The expression `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` calculates the next multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
   - This new value is assigned to `next_year`.

3. **Updated Values:**
   - `next_year` is updated to the next multiple of `ai` greater than `current_year`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, `test` is the third element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where both elements are `current_year`, `n` is the first item of the third element of `test_cases`, `a` is the second item of the third element of `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable, `current_year` is equal to the previous `next_year`, `next_year` is now the next multiple of `ai` greater than `current_year`, `ai` is the second item of the iterable `a`.**
