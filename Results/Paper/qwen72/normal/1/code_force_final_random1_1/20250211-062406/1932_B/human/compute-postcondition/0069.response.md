Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, `test` is the third element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing three elements where the first two elements are `current_year` and the third element is also `current_year`, `n` is the first item of the third element of `test_cases`, `a` is the second item of the third element of `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable, `current_year` is the final value after processing all elements in `a` according to the loop logic.**
