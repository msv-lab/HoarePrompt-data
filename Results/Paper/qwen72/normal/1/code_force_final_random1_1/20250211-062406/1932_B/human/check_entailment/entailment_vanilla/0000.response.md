### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the year when the nth sign occurs, given that each sign \(i\) occurs every \(a_i\) years.
   - The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the \(i\)-th sign must occur strictly after the \((i-1)\)-th sign.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `year` to 0.
   - For each sign \(a_i\), it updates the `year` by adding the remainder of `year` divided by \(a_i\) or \(a_i\) itself if the remainder is zero.
   - This ensures that the next sign occurs at the next multiple of \(a_i\) after the current `year`.

3. **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
   - **Initialization:** `year = 0`
   - **Loop through each sign \(a_i\):**
     - Calculate `year % ai` to find the remainder.
     - If `year % ai` is 0, add `ai` to `year` (this means the next occurrence of the sign is exactly `ai` years from now).
     - If `year % ai` is not 0, add `year % ai` to `year` (this means the next occurrence of the sign is the next multiple of `ai` after the current `year`).

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `3 2 4 5 9 18`:
     - Start with `year = 0`.
     - First sign (3): `year = 0 + 3 = 3`.
     - Second sign (2): `year = 3 + 1 = 4` (since 3 % 2 = 1).
     - Third sign (4): `year = 4 + 4 = 8` (since 4 % 4 = 0).
     - Fourth sign (5): `year = 8 + 2 = 10` (since 8 % 5 = 2).
     - Fifth sign (9): `year = 10 + 8 = 18` (since 10 % 9 = 8).
     - Sixth sign (18): `year = 18 + 18 = 36` (since 18 % 18 = 0).

   - The final `year` is 36, which matches the expected output.

5. **Generalization:**
   - The logic works for any sequence of signs because it correctly calculates the next multiple of each \(a_i\) after the current `year`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year when the nth sign occurs, ensuring that each sign occurs sequentially as required.

Correctness: **True**
