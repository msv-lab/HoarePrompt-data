Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the year when the n-th sign will occur, following the rules that each sign must occur sequentially and strictly after the previous one. The logic used in the program is to start from year 0 and for each sign, add the period of the sign or the next occurrence of the sign after the current year, whichever is applicable. This is done using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.

However, there's a critical flaw in the logic. The expression `year % ai or ai` does not correctly compute the next occurrence of the sign after the current year. Instead, it should find the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current `year`. The correct way to do this is to use the formula `year += ((year // ai) + 1) * ai - year` or a similar approach to ensure that the next occurrence is correctly calculated.

Given this, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
