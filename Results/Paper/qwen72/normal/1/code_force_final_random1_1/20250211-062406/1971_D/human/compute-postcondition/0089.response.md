Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input string with a length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is the number of positions where `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]` plus 1. If `flag` is True, `count` is reduced by 2, and `flag` remains True, indicating that there exists at least one position `j` such that `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1'. If `flag` is False, `count` remains unchanged.***
