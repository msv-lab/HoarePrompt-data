Output State: **`s` is a new input string with a length greater than 3, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `count` is 4 if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]` and `s[2]` is not equal to `s[3]`, otherwise `count` is 3 if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]` or `s[2]` is not equal to `s[3]`, otherwise `count` is 2. `flag` is True if `s[2]` is '0' and `s[3]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains as initially defined (True if `s[0]` is '0' and `s[1]` is '1' or if `s[1]` is '0' and `s[2]` is '1', otherwise False).**
