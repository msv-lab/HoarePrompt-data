Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input string with a length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `count` is 2 or 3 depending on whether `s[0]` equals `s[1]`. If `s[j]` (which is `s[1]`) is '0' and `s[j + 1]` (which is `s[2]`) is '1', then `flag` is True. Otherwise, `flag` remains as it was initially determined based on `s[0]` and `s[1]`.***
