Postcondition: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `s` is a new input string with a length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(s) - 1`. The variable `count` will be the total number of transitions between different characters in the string `s`. The variable `flag` is True, indicating that there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in the string `s`.**
