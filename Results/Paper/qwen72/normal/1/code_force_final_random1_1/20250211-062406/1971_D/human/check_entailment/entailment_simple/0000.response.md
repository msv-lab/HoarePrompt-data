### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum number of pieces a binary string needs to be cut into so that these pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string (all '0's before all '1's).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `count` to 1, which will keep track of the number of cuts needed.
   - It uses a flag `flag` to check if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1'.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and increments `count` whenever it finds a transition between different characters.
   - If a '0' to '1' transition is found, it sets `flag` to True.
   - After the loop, if `flag` is True, it decrements `count` by 1 because the last transition counted is not necessary for sorting.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (all '0's followed by all '1's), the algorithm correctly outputs 1.
   - If the string has no transitions (e.g., "000" or "111"), the algorithm correctly outputs 1.
   - If the string has multiple transitions, the algorithm correctly counts the necessary cuts.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The algorithm correctly handles the transitions and ensures that the minimum number of pieces is calculated.
   - The logic for reducing `count` by 1 when a '0' to '1' transition is found is correct because the last transition is not needed for sorting.
