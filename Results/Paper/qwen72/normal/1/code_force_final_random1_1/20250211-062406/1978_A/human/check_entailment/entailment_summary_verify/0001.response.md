Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's re-evaluate the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case consists of:
     - An integer `n` (number of books).
     - A list of `n` integers representing the number of pages in each book.

2. **Task:**
   - Divide the books into two non-empty piles.
   - Alice reads the book with the highest number of pages in each pile.
   - Output the maximum total number of pages Alice can read.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of page counts `nums`.

2. **Logic for Maximum Pages:**
   - The program uses `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]` to calculate the maximum number of pages Alice can read.
   - This logic assumes that the last book (`nums[-1]`) is always part of one pile, and the maximum of the remaining books (`nums[:-1]`) is part of the other pile.

3. **Correctness of Logic:**
   - The key insight here is that to maximize the total number of pages Alice reads, she should read the two largest books.
   - The provided logic does not always ensure this. For example, consider the input:
     ```
     4
     2 3 3 1
     ```
     - The program will output `3 + 1 = 4`, but the correct answer should be `3 + 3 = 6` by placing the two largest books in different piles.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not always produce the correct result because it does not consider the two largest books in the list. Instead, it always takes the last book and the maximum of the rest, which can lead to suboptimal results.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
