Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the largest two numbers in the list are not the last two elements. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 5 2 3 4
```

The correct output should be `9` (by placing the books with 5 and 4 pages in different piles), but the program will output `7` because it always adds the last element and the maximum of the rest, which in this case is `4 + 3`. This violates the requirement to maximize the sum of the highest number in each pile.
