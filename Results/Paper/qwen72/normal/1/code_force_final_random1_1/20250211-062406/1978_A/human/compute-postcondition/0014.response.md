The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters within the function signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should accept the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of books.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the number of pages in each book.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Since the specific output is not provided, I will assume that the function returns some form of processed data based on the number of pages in the books for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it accepts the number of books `n` and a list of integers `a` representing the number of pages in each book. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
