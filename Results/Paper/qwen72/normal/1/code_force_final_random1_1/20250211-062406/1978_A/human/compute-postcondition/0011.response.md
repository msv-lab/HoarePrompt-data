The code snippet `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `nums`.

- `t` remains greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1` from the previous iteration).
- `_` is a throwaway variable and is not affected.
- `n` is an input integer and is not affected.
- `nums` is updated to be a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1` from the previous iteration), `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the new input.**
