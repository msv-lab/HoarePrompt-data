Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (but will be decremented by 1), `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the input.** 

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `nums`. The values of `t`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged. The new value of `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input.
