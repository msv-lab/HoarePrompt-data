Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` remains unchanged, `odd` contains all the gaps that were greater than 1 and odd, and `even` contains all the gaps that were greater than 0 and even, with `even` now sorted in ascending order. The list `odd` is also sorted in ascending order.**
