To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop head involves the following elements:
- The variable `i` which will iterate over the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
- The length of the list `a`.

For the loop to execute, the range `range(1, len(a))` must contain at least one value. This means that `len(a)` must be greater than 1. If `len(a)` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute because the range will be empty.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9
- `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)
- `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x
- `tt` must be greater than 0
- `ii` is 0
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order
- `ans` is `x + y - 2`
- `tmp` is an empty list

We need to ensure that `len(a)` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `tt`, `ii`, `ans`, `tmp`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list**
