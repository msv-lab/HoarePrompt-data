The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the list `val`, so we can only adjust these.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is the second element of `val`.
- `val` is a non-empty list sorted with odd numbers first followed by even numbers, both groups in ascending order.
- `x` is the final value of `x` (unchanged from its value when the loop started).
- `c` is `i // 2`.
- `sx` is now `sx + i`.
- `y` is `y - 2 * c`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `val` needs to be considered. Since `i` was the second element, the next iteration will use the third element of `val`.

State: **`i` is the third element of `val`, `val` is a non-empty list sorted with odd numbers first followed by even numbers, both groups in ascending order, `x` is the final value of `x` (unchanged from its value when the loop started), `c` is `(third element of val) // 2`, `sx` is now `sx + (second element of val)`, `y` is `y - 2 * (second element of val) // 2`**
