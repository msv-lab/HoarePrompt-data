Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the last element in `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order, `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one element, `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in `odd` plus `gap`, `y` is set to 0 if `y < gap // 2`, otherwise `y` is decreased by the sum of half of each element in `odd` (integer division).** 

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is increased by the value of `gap`.
- The values of `i`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, and `even` remain unchanged.
- The condition `y < gap // 2` is checked:
  - If true, `y` is set to 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
  - If false, `y` is decreased by the sum of half of each element in `odd` (integer division).
