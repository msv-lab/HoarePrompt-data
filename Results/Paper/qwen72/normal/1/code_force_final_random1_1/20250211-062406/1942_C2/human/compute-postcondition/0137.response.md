The code `sx += y * 2` updates the value of `sx` by adding twice the value of `y` to it. The other variables (`i`, `val`, `x`, `c`, and `y`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is the first element of `val`
- `val` is a non-empty list sorted with odd numbers first followed by even numbers, both groups in ascending order
- `x` is the final value of `x` (unchanged from its value when the loop started)
- `c` is `i // 2`
- `y` is less than `c`
- `sx` is the count of how many times `c` was 1 during the loop

After executing the code:
- `sx` is updated to `sx + y * 2`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is the first element of `val`, `val` is a non-empty list sorted with odd numbers first followed by even numbers, both groups in ascending order, `x` is the final value of `x` (unchanged from its value when the loop started), `c` is `i // 2`, `y` is less than `c`, `sx` is `sx + y * 2`.**
