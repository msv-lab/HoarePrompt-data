Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is updated based on the loop conditions, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `tmp` is a list containing values that satisfy the condition `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for some indices `j`, and `ans` is the final value after all updates based on the loop conditions. Additionally, the sum of the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` equals 2.**
