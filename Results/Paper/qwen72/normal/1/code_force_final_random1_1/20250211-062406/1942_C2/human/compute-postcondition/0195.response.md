The only objects in the loop head are the variable `gap` and the list `even`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `even`. For the loop to execute again, `even` must have at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `even` had at least one more element, and `gap` was the next element in `even`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next `gap` will be the subsequent element in `even`, and `even` must still have at least one more element after this new `gap` is taken.

State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `even`, `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order, `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element. `ans` is increased by the value of `gap`. `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.**
