Postcondition: **`i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + sum(odd)`, `odd` contains all the gaps that were greater than 1 and odd, and is sorted in ascending order, `even` contains all the gaps that were greater than 0 and even, and is sorted in ascending order, `y` is `y - sum(gap // 2 for gap in odd)`, `even` must contain at least one element, `gap` is the first element in `even`, and the current value of `y` is less than `gap // 2`.**
