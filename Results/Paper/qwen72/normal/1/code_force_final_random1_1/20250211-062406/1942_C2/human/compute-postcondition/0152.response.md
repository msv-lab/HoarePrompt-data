Output State: **`i` is the third element of `val`, `val` is a non-empty list sorted with odd numbers first followed by even numbers, both groups in ascending order, `x` is the final value of `x` (unchanged from its value when the loop started), `c` is `(third element of val) // 2`, `sx` is now `sx + (second element of val) + y * 2`, `y` is `y - 2 * (second element of val) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `sx += y * 2` updates the value of `sx` by adding `y * 2` to its current value.
- The initial state indicates that `sx` was already updated to `sx + (second element of val)`.
- Therefore, after executing `sx += y * 2`, `sx` becomes `sx + (second element of val) + y * 2`.
- All other variables (`i`, `val`, `x`, `c`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
