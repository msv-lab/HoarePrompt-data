Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `x`, `x` is the final value of `x` (unchanged from its value when the loop started), `c` is `l[x] - l[x-1] - 1`, `val` is sorted with odd numbers first followed by even numbers, both groups in ascending order, and `sx` is the count of how many times `c` was 1 during the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is the first element of `val`, `val` is a non-empty list sorted with odd numbers first followed by even numbers, both groups in ascending order, `x` is the final value of `x` (unchanged from its value when the loop started), `c` is `i // 2`, `sx` is the count of how many times `c` was 1 during the loop plus `y * 2` if `y` is less than `c`, otherwise `sx` is the count of how many times `c` was 1 during the loop, and `sx` is now `sx + i`, `y` is `y - c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is the second element of `val`, `val` is a non-empty list sorted with odd numbers first followed by even numbers, both groups in ascending order, `x` is the final value of `x` (unchanged from its value when the loop started), `c` is `i // 2`, `sx` is now `sx + i`, `y` is `y - 2 * c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the third element of `val`, `val` is a non-empty list sorted with odd numbers first followed by even numbers, both groups in ascending order, `x` is the final value of `x` (unchanged from its value when the loop started), `c` is `(third element of val) // 2`, `sx` is now `sx + (second element of val) + i`, `y` is `y - (third element of val) // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
