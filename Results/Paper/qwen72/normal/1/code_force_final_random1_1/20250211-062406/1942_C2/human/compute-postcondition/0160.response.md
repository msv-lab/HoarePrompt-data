To determine what will be printed by the `print(cons)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`val`**: This is a non-empty list sorted with odd numbers first followed by even numbers, both groups in ascending order.
2. **`i`**: This is the last element of `val`.
3. **`x`**: This is the final value of `x` (unchanged from its value when the loop started).
4. **`c`**: This is the last element of `val` divided by 2.
5. **`sx`**: This is the sum of all elements in `val` up to the point where `y` becomes less than `c` (if such a condition occurs) or the sum of all elements in `val` plus any additional adjustments based on the `y < c` condition.
6. **`y`**: This is reduced by the sum of the integer division of each element in `val` by 2 up to the point where the loop breaks (if it does).
7. **`cons`**: This is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`.

Let's analyze each step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Determine `i`**:
   - `i` is the last element of `val`. Since `val` is sorted with odd numbers first followed by even numbers, `i` will be the largest number in `val`.

2. **Determine `c`**:
   - `c` is `i / 2`. Since `i` is the largest number in `val`, `c` will be half of this largest number.

3. **Determine `sx`**:
   - `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` up to the point where `y` becomes less than `c`. If `y` never becomes less than `c`, `sx` will be the sum of all elements in `val`.

4. **Determine `y`**:
   - `y` is reduced by the sum of the integer division of each element in `val` by 2 up to the point where the loop breaks. This means `y` is reduced by the sum of `val[j] // 2` for each `j` until `y < c`.

5. **Determine `cons`**:
   - `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`. Here, `n` is the length of `val`, `x` is the final value of `x`, and `sx` is the sum of elements in `val` as determined above.

### Example Calculation

Let's assume a specific example to illustrate the calculation:

- Suppose `val = [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6]`.
- `i` is the last element of `val`, so `i = 6`.
- `c` is `i / 2`, so `c = 3`.
- `sx` is the sum of elements in `val` up to the point where `y` becomes less than `c`. Let's assume `y` starts at a large enough value to cover the entire list:
  - Sum of `val`: `1 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 6 = 21`.
  - If `y` is reduced by the sum of `val[j] // 2` for each `j`:
    - `1 // 2 = 0`
    - `3 // 2 = 1`
    - `5 // 2 = 2`
    - `2 // 2 = 1`
    - `4 // 2 = 2`
    - `6 // 2 = 3`
    - Total reduction: `0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 9`.
  - If `y` was initially large enough, `y` would become `y - 9`.
  - If `y - 9 < 3`, then `y` would be less than `c` after the reduction.
  - Therefore, `sx` would be the sum of elements up to the point where `y` becomes less than `c`.

- `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`:
  - `n` is the length of `val`, so `n = 6`.
  - `n - 2 = 4`.
  - `x` is the final value of `x` (unchanged).
  - `sx` is the sum of elements up to the point where `y` becomes less than `c`.

### Final Output

Given the complexity and the need for precise values, the output will be:

Output: **cons (where cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, with n being the length of val, x being the final value of x, and sx being the sum of elements in val up to the point where y becomes less than c)**.
