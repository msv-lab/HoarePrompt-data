Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the input, each consisting of integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of edges required to connect a set of vertices in a specific way, considering the given constraints. The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` is 0, and the final state includes the updated values of `y`, `l`, `val`, `sx`, and `cons` for each test case. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly to the console. **
