Postcondition: ***`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order, `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, `ans` is increased by `2 * y`, `y` is set to 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by the new `gap`, and `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.***
