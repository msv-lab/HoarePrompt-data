The code snippet updates the value of `t1` to `(a[i] + 1) % n`. Given that `i` is 1, the new value of `t1` is `(a[1] + 1) % n`.

The initial state specifies that `t1` was initially `(a[0] + 1) % n`. After the code execution, `t1` is now `(a[1] + 1) % n`. The values of `i`, `x`, `t2`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is 1, `x` is greater than 1, `t1` is `(a[1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[0] + 2) % n`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
