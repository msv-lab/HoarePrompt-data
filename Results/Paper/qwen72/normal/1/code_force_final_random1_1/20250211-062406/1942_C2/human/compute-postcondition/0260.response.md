The only object in the loop head is the variable `gap` and the list `odd`, so we can only adjust these.

For the loop to execute, the list `odd` must contain at least one element. The state of `gap` will be the first element in the list `odd` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` remains unchanged, `odd` contains all the gaps that were greater than 1 and odd and must have at least 1 element, `even` contains all the gaps that were greater than 0 and even, with `even` now sorted in ascending order, and `odd` is also sorted in ascending order, `gap` is the first element in the list `odd`**
