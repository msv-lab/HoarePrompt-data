The code snippet updates the value of `t2` based on the current value of `i`, which is 1. The new value of `t2` is calculated as `(a[1] + 2) % n`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `i` is 1.
- `t2` is updated to `(a[1] + 2) % n`.

The other variables (`i`, `x`, `t1`, `st`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is 1, `x` is greater than 1, `t1` is `(a[1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[1] + 2) % n`, if `t1` is not in the set `st` and `t2` is in the set `st`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
