Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n, x, and y are integers where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; tt is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(tt):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = x + y - 2
    tmp = []
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
            tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
            ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
            y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
    if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]
        ) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
    ans += y
    print(min(ans, n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the final value after processing all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` according to the loop logic plus the final value of `y`. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, `ans` is incremented by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `tmp` includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. `tmp` is a list containing the values `(a[j] - a[j-1]) // 2` for all pairs where `(a[j] - a[j-1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[j] - a[j-1]) // 2 - 1` were true, and `y` is the final value after subtracting the appropriate amounts for each such pair.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is updated based on the loop conditions, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `tmp` is a list containing values that satisfy the condition `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for some indices `j`, and `ans` is the final value after all updates based on the loop conditions plus the current value of `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The code snippet `ans += y` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `y`. Here's the detailed impact:

- `ans` is incremented by the value of `y`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `tt`, `ii`, `i`, `a`, `tmp`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5).
- `y` is an input integer.
- `tt` is greater than 2.
- `ii` is 2.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- `tmp` is a list of integers.
- `ans` is the final computed value based on the loop's operations.

After executing `ans += y`:
- `ans` is now `ans + y`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `tmp` is a list of integers, and `ans` is `ans + y`.**




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
