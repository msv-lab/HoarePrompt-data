The code snippet `tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)` appends the result of the expression `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5).
- `y` is either unchanged or updated to `y - ((a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1)`.
- `tt` is greater than 1.
- `ii` is 1.
- `i` is 3.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements.
- `tmp` is a list that may contain the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.
- `ans` is increased by 1 if `a[2] - a[1] == 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` if the condition `(a[2] - a[1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1` is true.

### Step-by-Step Impact Analysis:
1. **Expression Calculation**:
   - The expression `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` calculates the integer division of the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of the list `a`.
   - Given `i` is 3, the expression becomes `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.

2. **Appending to `tmp`**:
   - The result of the expression `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` is appended to the list `tmp`.

### Updated Values:
- `tmp` now contains the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` in addition to its previous contents.

### Unchanged Values:
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `tt`, `ii`, `i`, `a`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is either unchanged or updated to `y - ((a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1)`, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements, `tmp` is a list that now contains the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` in addition to its previous contents, `ans` is increased by 1 if `a[2] - a[1] == 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` if the condition `(a[2] - a[1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1` is true.**
