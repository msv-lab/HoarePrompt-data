Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the last element in `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order, `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one element, `ans` is increased by `2 * y`, `y` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code sets `y` to 0.
- All other variables (`i`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, `even`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition that `y` is less than half of the last element in `odd` (`gap // 2`) is no longer relevant since `y` is now 0. However, the initial state of `y` being less than `gap // 2` was true before the assignment, and it remains true after the assignment because 0 is always less than any positive number.
