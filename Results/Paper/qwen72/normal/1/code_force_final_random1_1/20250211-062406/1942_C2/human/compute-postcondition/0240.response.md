Postcondition: ***`i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is unchanged, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list if `gap` is less than or equal to 1, or `even` is a list containing `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and `gap` is even, `x` is greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, and `gap` is either less than or equal to 1 or greater than 0 and even.***
