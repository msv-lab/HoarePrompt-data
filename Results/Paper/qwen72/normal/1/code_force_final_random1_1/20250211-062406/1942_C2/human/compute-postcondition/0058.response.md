Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, and `tmp` is a list. If the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]` is 2, then `ans` is `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, if the difference is even and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. If the difference is not 2 and does not meet the above condition, `ans` remains `x + y - 2` and `tmp` remains an empty list.***
