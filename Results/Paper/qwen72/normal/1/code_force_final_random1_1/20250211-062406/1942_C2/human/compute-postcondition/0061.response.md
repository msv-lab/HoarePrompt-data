The code appends the result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given the initial state, let's break down the impact:

- `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements.
- `i` is 2, so `a[i]` is the third element in the list `a`.
- `i - 1` is 1, so `a[i - 1]` is the second element in the list `a`.
- The expression `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` calculates the integer division of the difference between the third and second elements of `a` by 2.
- This result is appended to the list `tmp`.

Since the initial state specifies that `a` is sorted in ascending order, the difference `a[2] - a[1]` is non-negative, and the integer division by 2 will yield a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5).
- `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x.
- `tt` is greater than 1.
- `ii` is 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements.
- `tmp` is a list containing one element, which is `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.**
