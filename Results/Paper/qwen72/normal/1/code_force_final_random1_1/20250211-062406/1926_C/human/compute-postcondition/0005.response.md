The code snippet `a = a + num % 10` updates the value of `a` by adding the last digit of `num` to it. Given that `num` is a positive integer with its last digit removed and `num` must not be 0, the last digit of `num` (which is now the second last digit of the original `num`) is added to `a`.

Since `num` is a positive integer and the last digit has been removed, `num % 10` gives the new last digit of `num`. This digit is added to the current value of `a`.

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, with the last digit removed, and `num` must not be 0; `a` is updated to `a + num % 10`**.
