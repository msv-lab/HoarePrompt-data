To determine what will be printed by the `print(pd[n])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be at least 1.
- `n` is an input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(pd[n])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `pd`**: The variable `pd` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. This means we don't have information about what `pd` is or what it contains. It could be a list, a dictionary, or any other data structure.
2. **Index `n`**: The variable `n` is described as an input integer. This means `n` can be any integer value, but it must be a valid index for the data structure `pd`.

### Possible Scenarios:
- If `pd` is a list, `pd[n]` will access the element at index `n` of the list.
- If `pd` is a dictionary, `pd[n]` will access the value associated with the key `n`.
- If `pd` is not defined or `n` is out of bounds, this will result in an error.

### Conclusion:
Since the initial state does not provide enough information about the contents of `pd` or the value of `n`, we cannot determine the exact value that will be printed. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

### Final Output:
Output: **pd[n] (where pd is the data structure and n is the input integer)**

This output indicates that the print statement will print the value at index `n` of the data structure `pd`, but without more specific information about `pd` and `n`, we cannot provide a more precise value.
