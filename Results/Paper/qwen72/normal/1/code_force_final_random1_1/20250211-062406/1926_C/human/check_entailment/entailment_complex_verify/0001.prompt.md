You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program: 
A = []
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 200001):
    a = func_1(i)
    sum = sum + a
    A.append(sum)
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(A[n - 1])

def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num / 10)
    return a



- Annotated Code: 
A = []
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 200001):
    a = func_1(i)
    sum = sum + a
    A.append(sum)
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(A[n - 1])

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        
        num = int(num / 10)
        
    #State: `num` is 0, and `a` is the sum of the digits of the original `num`.
    return a
    #The program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `num` (where 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5) and returns the sum of its digits. After the function executes, `num` is reduced to 0, and the returned value is the sum of the digits of the original `num`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Precomputation of Sums**:
   - The program precomputes the sums of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores them in the list `A`.
   - This is done using a loop that iterates from 1 to 200,000.
   - For each number `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits using the function `func_1` and adds this value to the cumulative sum `sum`.
   - The cumulative sum is then appended to the list `A`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `num` and returns the sum of its digits.
   - It does this by repeatedly taking the last digit of `num` (using `num % 10`) and adding it to the variable `a`, then removing the last digit (using `int(num / 10)`).
   - This process continues until `num` becomes 0.

3. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and prints the precomputed sum from the list `A` at index `n-1`.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, where n is 200,000.
   - Each test case is handled in O(1) time because it involves a direct lookup in the precomputed list `A`.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic for calculating the sum of digits is correct.
   - The precomputation ensures that the results for any `n` within the range are available instantly.
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the correct results for each.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
