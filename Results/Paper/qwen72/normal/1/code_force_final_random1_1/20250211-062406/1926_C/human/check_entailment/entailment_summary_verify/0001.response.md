### Reasoning:

1. **Precomputation of Sums**:
   - The program precomputes the sums of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores them in the list `A`.
   - This is done using a loop that iterates from 1 to 200,000.
   - For each number `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits using the function `func_1` and adds this value to the cumulative sum `sum`.
   - The cumulative sum is then appended to the list `A`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `num` and returns the sum of its digits.
   - It does this by repeatedly taking the last digit of `num` (using `num % 10`) and adding it to the variable `a`, then removing the last digit (using `int(num / 10)`).
   - This process continues until `num` becomes 0.
   - The function summary confirms that `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of `num`.

3. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and prints the precomputed sum from the list `A` at index `n-1`.
   - This ensures that the program can handle multiple test cases efficiently.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, where n is 200,000.
   - Each test case is handled in O(1) time because it involves a direct lookup in the precomputed list `A`.
   - Given the constraints (time limit of 0.5 seconds per test), the precomputation is efficient and the test case handling is optimal.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic for calculating the sum of digits is correct as verified by the function summary.
   - The precomputation ensures that the results for any `n` within the range are available instantly.
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the correct results for each.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **True**
