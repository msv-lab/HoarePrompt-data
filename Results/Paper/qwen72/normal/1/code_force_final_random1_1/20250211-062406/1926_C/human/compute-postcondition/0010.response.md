Output State: **`num` is 0, and `a` is the sum of the digits of the original `num`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `num` becomes 0 because the loop continues to divide `num` by 10 until it reaches 0. The variable `a` accumulates the sum of the digits of the original `num` as each digit is added to `a` during each iteration of the loop.
