Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0, `pd[i]` (where `i` is `N`) is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N`, `i` is `N`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character `j` in the string representation of `N`.
- For each iteration, the integer value of `j` is added to `pd[N]`.
- After all iterations, `pd[N]` will be equal to `pd[N-1]` plus the sum of the digits of `N`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `N` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The list `pd` remains the same length, and only `pd[N]` is updated to reflect the sum of the digits of `N` added to `pd[N-1]`.
