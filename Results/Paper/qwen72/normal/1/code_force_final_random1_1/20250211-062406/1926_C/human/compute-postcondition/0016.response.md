The provided code snippet updates the value of `pd[i]` by adding the integer value of `j`. However, the variable `j` is not defined in the initial state, which means its value is unknown. This impacts the calculation of `pd[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case
- `N` is 200001
- `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0, and `pd[i]` set to the sum of the digits of `i` for each `i` from 1 to `N-1`
- `i` is `N`
- `pd[N]` is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N`

The code snippet:
```
pd[i] += int(j)
```

Since `j` is not defined, the exact value added to `pd[i]` is unknown. However, the operation itself increments `pd[i]` by the integer value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0, `pd[i]` (where `i` is `N`) is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N` plus the integer value of `j`, `i` is `N`.**
