The value of `num` is updated to the integer division of `num` by 10, which effectively removes the last digit of `num`. Since `num` was initially a positive integer with the last digit removed and must not be 0, after the operation, `num` will still be a positive integer, but with one more digit removed from the end. The value of `a` remains updated to `a + num % 10` as per the initial state, but since `num` has been updated, the next operation involving `num % 10` will yield a different result.

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer with one more digit removed from the end, `a` is updated to `a + num % 10` (with the new value of `num`), and `num` must not be 0.**
