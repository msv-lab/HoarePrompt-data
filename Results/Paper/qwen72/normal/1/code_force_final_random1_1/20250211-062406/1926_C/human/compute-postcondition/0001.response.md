The only variables in the loop head are `num`. The loop will execute as long as `num` is not equal to 0. Given that `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute at least once because it cannot be 0.

State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is 0**
