Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). It then prints the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the cumulative digit sums for the corresponding `n` values have been printed. **
