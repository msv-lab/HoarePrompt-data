The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints given, it is implied that the function should accept two parameters: `t` and `n`. The parameter `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. The parameter `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, which could represent some value or count associated with each test case.

Since the output is not specified, we cannot determine the exact return value without additional context. However, typically in such scenarios, the function might return a result for each test case, possibly a list of results, or handle each test case internally and return a final aggregated result or status.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `t` and `n`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `n` is an integer associated with each test case (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). The function's return value is not specified, but it likely processes each test case and returns a result or a collection of results based on the processing of these parameters.**
