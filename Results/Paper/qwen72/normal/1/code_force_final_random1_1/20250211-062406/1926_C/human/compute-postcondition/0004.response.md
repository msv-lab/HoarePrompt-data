The variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If `num` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, with the last digit removed. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must still be a positive integer and not equal to 0.

State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, with the last digit removed, and `num` must not be 0**
