To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `l`. The loop will execute if `l` is greater than 0. The variable `j` should start from 0 for the loop to iterate through the range of `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabets (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `j` is `l-1` (this needs to be adjusted).
- `l` is the new input integer (this determines if the loop will execute).
- `ans` is an empty list (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `i` is `l` (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `array` is a list of integers provided by the user (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array` (not directly relevant to the loop execution).

For the loop to execute, `l` must be greater than 0, and `j` should start from 0.

State: **`alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabets, `j` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is `l`, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user, `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`**
