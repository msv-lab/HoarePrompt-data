You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    
    8
    
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Output

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        alp = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
        rev_array = array[::-1]
        ans = []
        for j in range(l):
            ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
        print(''.join(map(str, ans)))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then constructs a string based on the reversed list of integers and the English alphabet, printing the resulting string for each test case. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the trace correctly for certain inputs. Specifically, the logic used to reconstruct the string from the trace is flawed. Here’s a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
5
0 1 2 0 0
```

Expected Output:
```
abcda
```

Actual Output:
```
abcba
```

In this case, the trace `[0, 1, 2, 0, 0]` indicates that the first character is unique, the second character has appeared once before, the third character has appeared twice before, and the fourth and fifth characters are unique. However, the program incorrectly assigns the same letter to the fourth and fifth positions, which does not match the trace. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
