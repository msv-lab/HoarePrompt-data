Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then constructs a string based on the reversed list of integers and the English alphabet, printing the resulting string for each test case. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution. **
