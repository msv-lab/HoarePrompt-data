Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n), representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    l = int(input())
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    alp = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm',
        'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
    rev_array = array[::-1]
    ans = []
    for j in range(l):
        ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
    print(''.join(map(str, ans)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `array` is a list of integers read from the input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing `l` elements, each element being the character from `alp` indexed by the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` minus 1, `j` is `l-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is `l-1`, `l` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is updated by appending `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for each iteration from `j=0` to `j=l-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabets, `j` is `l-1`, `l` is the same as the initial value, `ans` is a list containing letters from `alp` based on the count of each element in `rev_array` from its position to the end of `rev_array`, `i` is `l`, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user, `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
