The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the value `l`. The loop can execute if `j` is less than `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `l` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and `l` must still be greater than `j`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `l` must be greater than 1, `array` is a list of integers read from the input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the character from `alp` indexed by the count of `rev_array[0]` in `rev_array[0:]` minus 1, `j` is 1**
