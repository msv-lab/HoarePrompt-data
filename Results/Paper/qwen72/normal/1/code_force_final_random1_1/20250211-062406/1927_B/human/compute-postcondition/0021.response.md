To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: `j` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0.
2. **Code Execution**:
   - `rev_array[j:]` slices `rev_array` starting from index `j` (which is 0) to the end of the array.
   - `rev_array[j]` retrieves the element at index `j` (which is 0).
   - `rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j])` counts the number of occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the sliced array.
   - `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` accesses the element in `alp` at the index calculated by subtracting 1 from the count.
   - `ans.append(...)` appends the accessed element to the list `ans`.

### Impact on Variables:
- `ans` is modified by appending a new element.
- The value of `j` remains 0.
- The value of `l` remains greater than 0.

### Calculation:
- Let's denote `rev_array[0]` as `element`.
- The count of `element` in `rev_array[0:]` is `count`.
- The element appended to `ans` is `alp[count - 1]`.

### Output State:
- `j` is 0.
- `l` is greater than 0.
- `ans` is updated by appending `alp[rev_array[0:].count(rev_array[0]) - 1]`.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `l` is greater than 0, `ans` is updated by appending `alp[rev_array[0:].count(rev_array[0]) - 1]`.**
