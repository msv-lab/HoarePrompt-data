Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `array` is a list of integers read from the input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing `l` elements, each element being the character from `alp` indexed by the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` minus 1, `i` is `t`, `j` is `l-1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- **`n`**: The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- **`a`**: The list `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n-1`.
- **`l`**: The variable `l` is the length of the list `array`, which is read from the input for each test case.
- **`array`**: The list `array` contains the integers read from the input for each test case.
- **`alp`**: The list `alp` remains a list of lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'.
- **`rev_array`**: The list `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.
- **`ans`**: The list `ans` contains `l` elements, where each element is a character from `alp` determined by the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` minus 1.
- **`i`**: After all iterations, `i` is equal to `t`, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- **`j`**: The variable `j` is `l-1`, which is the last index of the list `array` for the current test case.

This output state reflects the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations for all test cases.
