The code snippet `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into separate strings based on spaces, converts each string into an integer, and stores these integers in the list `array`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n
- `l` is an input integer greater than 0

After executing the code snippet:
- `array` is now a list of integers read from the input.

The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers read from the input.**
