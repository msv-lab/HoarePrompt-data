To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `a` is the first integer from the third line of the input.
- `b` is the sum of the second and third integers from the third line of the input.
- `c` is the third integer from the third line of the input.
- `s` is the third line of the input.

### Print Statement:
```python
print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Extracting Values from the Third Line of Input:**
   - Let's assume the third line of the input is `x y z`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers.
   - Therefore, `a = x`, `b = y + z`, and `c = z`.

2. **Calculating `b % 3`:**
   - `b % 3` is the remainder when `b` is divided by 3.
   - Since `b = y + z`, `b % 3` is the remainder of `(y + z) % 3`.

3. **Evaluating the Condition `c < b % 3`:**
   - This condition checks if `c` (which is `z`) is less than `b % 3`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is true, the expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` will evaluate to `-1`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is false, the expression will evaluate to `a - -b // 3`.

4. **Calculating `a - -b // 3`:**
   - `a - -b // 3` simplifies to `a + b // 3`.
   - `b // 3` is the integer division of `b` by 3.
   - Therefore, `a + b // 3` is the sum of `a` and the integer division of `b` by 3.

### Final Output:
- If `c < b % 3` is true, the output will be `-1`.
- If `c < b % 3` is false, the output will be `a + b // 3`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the third line of the input is `1 2 3`:
- `a = 1`
- `b = 2 + 3 = 5`
- `c = 3`
- `b % 3 = 5 % 3 = 2`
- `c < b % 3` is `3 < 2`, which is false.
- Therefore, the expression evaluates to `a + b // 3 = 1 + 5 // 3 = 1 + 1 = 2`.

### General Case:
- If `c < b % 3` is true, the output will be `-1`.
- If `c < b % 3` is false, the output will be `a + b // 3`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **(a + b // 3) if c < b % 3 is false, otherwise -1 (where a is the first integer from the third line of the input, b is the sum of the second and third integers from the third line of the input, and c is the third integer from the third line of the input)**
