Output State: **a, b, and c are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. The values of a, b, and c are now updated to the integers parsed from the first line of the input provided to `open(0)`. After the code execution, `b` is equal to the original value of `b` plus the original value of `c`.**
