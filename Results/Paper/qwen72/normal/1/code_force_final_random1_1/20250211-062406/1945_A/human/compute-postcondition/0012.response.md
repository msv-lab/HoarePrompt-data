Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the values from the last line of the input file. Additionally, `b` will be the sum of the original `b` and `c` values from each line of the input file. The loop will have printed a series of outputs based on the condition `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` for each line of input.**

### Explanation:
- **`a`**: This variable will be set to the first integer from the last line of the input file.
- **`b`**: This variable will be the sum of the second integer (`b`) and the third integer (`c`) from each line of the input file. Specifically, `b` will accumulate the sum of all `c` values added to their respective `b` values from each line.
- **`c`**: This variable will be set to the third integer from the last line of the input file.
- **Printed Output**: For each line of input, the loop will print either `a - -b // 3` or `-1` depending on whether `c` is less than `b % 3`. The final state of the loop will reflect the results of these conditions for each line of input.
