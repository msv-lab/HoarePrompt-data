Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input, splitting each line into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Logic for Extroverts and Universals**:
   - The program adds the number of universals (`c`) to the number of extroverts (`b`). This is done because universals can fill in for extroverts' requirements, which need to be in groups of three.
   
3. **Condition for Impossibility**:
   - The program checks if the number of universals (`c`) is less than the remainder when `b` is divided by 3 (`b % 3`). If this condition is true, it means there are not enough universals to form complete groups of three with the extroverts, making it impossible to satisfy the extroverts' requirement. In this case, the program prints `-1`.

4. **Calculating the Minimum Number of Tents**:
   - If the above condition is false, the program calculates the total number of tents required. The formula used is `a - -b // 3`, which can be broken down as follows:
     - `a` represents the number of tents needed for introverts, each requiring their own tent.
     - `- -b // 3` is a way to ensure that the division is always rounded up. This is because `b` (now including universals) needs to be divided into groups of three, and any remainder should result in an additional tent. The expression `- -b // 3` effectively rounds up the division of `b` by 3.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, either the minimum number of tents or `-1` if it's impossible to satisfy the conditions.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `a`, `b`, or `c` are zero, and when the number of universals is sufficient to form complete groups with extroverts.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
