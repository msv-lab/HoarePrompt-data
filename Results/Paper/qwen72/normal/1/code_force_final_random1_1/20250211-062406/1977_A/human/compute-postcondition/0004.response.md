Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `n` is equal to `m`.

Given these conditions, the `print('Yes')` statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
