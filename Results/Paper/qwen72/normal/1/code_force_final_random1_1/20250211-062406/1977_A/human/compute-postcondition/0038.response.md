The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. Based on the initial state and the conditions given, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` will only remain unchanged if certain conditions are met. However, the code snippet itself does not enforce these conditions; it simply updates `n` and `m` with the new input values.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100
- `i` is 2
- `n` is the first integer from the new input
- `m` is the second integer from the new input

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` and `m` are updated with the new input values.
- The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input.**
