The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This means that the values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the new input. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, and `n` and `m` are initially set based on the first and second integers from the input. After executing the code, `n` and `m` are reassigned to new values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input.**
