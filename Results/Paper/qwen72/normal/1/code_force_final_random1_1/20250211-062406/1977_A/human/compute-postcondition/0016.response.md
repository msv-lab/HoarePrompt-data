Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `n` is not equal to `m`.
- `m` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.
- Either `m` is not even or `n` is not even.
- Both `m` and `n` are odd.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is simply:

```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It will always print the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
