Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining whether it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

- Input: `n = 4`, `m = 2`
- Expected Output: `Yes`
- Actual Output: `No`

In this case, Nikita can achieve a tower with 2 cubes after 4 moves by performing the following sequence of moves:
1. Put a cube (tower height: 1)
2. Put a cube (tower height: 2)
3. Remove a cube (tower height: 1)
4. Put a cube (tower height: 2)

The program incorrectly outputs "No" because it doesn't account for the possibility of reaching the desired height through a combination of adding and removing cubes. The conditions in the program are too restrictive and do not cover all valid scenarios.
