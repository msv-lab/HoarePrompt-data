Reasoning:

The function aims to determine if, after `n` moves, a tower can have exactly `m` cubes. The logic implemented in the function checks several conditions to decide if the desired outcome is achievable:

1. **If `n` equals `m`:** This means that every move is used to add a cube, which directly results in a tower of height `m`. This condition is correctly handled.
2. **If `m` is greater than `n`:** It's impossible to have more cubes in the tower than the number of moves made, so this condition correctly returns "No".
3. **If `m` equals `n - 1`:** This implies that one move was used to remove a cube, and the rest were used to add cubes, which is a valid scenario.
4. **If both `n` and `m` are even or both are odd:** This condition ensures that the parity of the number of moves matches the parity of the number of cubes, which is necessary because adding or removing a cube changes the parity of the tower's height. This is a crucial part of the logic, as the parity must match for the operation to be possible.

However, there is a potential issue with the logic. The condition `elif m == n - 1:` is redundant and can be misleading. If `m` is `n - 1`, it should always be possible to achieve `m` cubes, regardless of the parity of `n` and `m`. This condition should be removed, and the logic should rely solely on the parity check and the basic conditions (`n == m` and `m > n`).

Despite this redundancy, the function still works correctly for the given problem constraints and examples. The parity check and the basic conditions cover all necessary scenarios.

Therefore, the overall correctness of the function is:

Correctness: **True**
