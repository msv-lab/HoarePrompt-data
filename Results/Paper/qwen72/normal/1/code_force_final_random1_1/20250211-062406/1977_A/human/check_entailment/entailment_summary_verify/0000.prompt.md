You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) from the input. It then evaluates the relationship between `n` and `m` and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on the following conditions: if `n` equals `m`, or `m` equals `n - 1`, or both `n` and `m` are even, or both `n` and `m` are odd, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the values of `t`, `i` (which is `t - 1`), `n`, and `m` from the last test case. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining whether it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

- Input: `n = 4`, `m = 2`
- Expected Output: `Yes`
- Actual Output: `No`

In this case, Nikita can achieve a tower with 2 cubes after 4 moves by performing the following sequence of moves:
1. Put a cube (tower height: 1)
2. Put a cube (tower height: 2)
3. Remove a cube (tower height: 1)
4. Put a cube (tower height: 2)

The program incorrectly outputs "No" because it doesn't account for the possibility of reaching the desired height through a combination of adding and removing cubes. The conditions in the program are too restrictive and do not cover all valid scenarios.
