Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- `m` is the second integer from the new input.

The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state, it will simply print the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
