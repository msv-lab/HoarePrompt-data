Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly handles the logic for determining whether it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves. It checks several conditions:

1. If `n` equals `m`, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can simply add a cube `n` times.
2. If `m` is greater than `n`, it prints 'No' because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
3. If `m` equals `n - 1`, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can add a cube `n-1` times and then remove one cube.
4. If both `m` and `n` are even, it prints 'Yes' because an even number of moves can result in an even number of cubes.
5. If both `m` and `n` are odd, it prints 'Yes' because an odd number of moves can result in an odd number of cubes.
6. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

These conditions cover all the necessary scenarios to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
