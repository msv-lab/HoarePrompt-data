Reasoning:  
The program attempts to solve the problem by reading the number of test cases and then, for each test case, it reads the grid and counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. It then checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle. However, this approach is flawed because it only checks the first two rows, which may not be sufficient to correctly identify the shape, especially in cases where the shape is a triangle but the first two rows happen to have the same number of '1's.

For example, consider the following grid:
```
0000
0100
1110
1110
```
This grid represents a triangle, but the program would incorrectly identify it as a square because the first two rows both contain one '1'.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all possible cases and can produce incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
