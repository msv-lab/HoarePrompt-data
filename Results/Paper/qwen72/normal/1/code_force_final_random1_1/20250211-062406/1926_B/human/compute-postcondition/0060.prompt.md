Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is a positive integer equal to the value of `t`, `b` is the last user input string, `k` is an empty list, `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and the grid remain unchanged, and the first element of `k` no longer exists (as `k` is now an empty list). The loop cannot execute again because `i` is already equal to `a`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is a positive integer greater than 0, derived from the user input; `b` is an input string. If `b` contains the character '1', `k` is a list that includes the count of '1' characters in `b`. If `b` does not contain the character '1', `k` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`_` is a positive integer greater than 0 but one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `b` is a new input string. If `b` contains the character '1', `k` is a list that now includes the count of '1' characters in the new `b` appended to its previous values. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`_` is a positive integer greater than 0 but one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `b` is a new input string. If '1' is in `b`, `k` is a list with an additional element equal to the number of '1's in `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
