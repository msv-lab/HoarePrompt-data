The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the `range(int(input()))` expression. For the loop to execute, the input provided to the `range` function must be a positive integer. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `grid`, `a`, `i`, `k`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, the input must be at least 1. Therefore, the state should reflect that the input to the `range` function is a positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, the grid is represented by n lines of n characters (each character is either '0' or '1'), the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list, the input to the `range` function must be a positive integer**
