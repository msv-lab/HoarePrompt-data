Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `_` is a positive integer equal to the value of `t`, `b` is the last user input string. The list `k` contains the counts of '1's from each input string `b` where '1' was present, and its length is equal to the number of input strings that contained at least one '1'. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and the grid remain unchanged.**
