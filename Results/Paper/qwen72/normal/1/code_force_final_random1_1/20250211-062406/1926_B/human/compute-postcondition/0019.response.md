Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10.
- The grid is represented by n lines of n characters (each character is either '0' or '1').
- The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1.
- `a` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in each input string `b` that contained at least one '1'. If no input strings contained any '1', `k` remains an empty list.
- Additionally, the first two elements of `k` are equal (`k[0] == k[1]`).

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('SQUARE')
```

### Explanation:
- The grid contains exactly one shape (either a triangle or a square) that includes all '1's.
- The condition `k[0] == k[1]` implies that the number of '1's in the first two rows of the grid is the same.
- Since the shape's size is greater than 1 and the number of '1's in the first two rows is the same, the only shape that fits this description is a square (as a triangle would have a different number of '1's in the first two rows).

Therefore, the `print` statement will output:

Output: **SQUARE**
