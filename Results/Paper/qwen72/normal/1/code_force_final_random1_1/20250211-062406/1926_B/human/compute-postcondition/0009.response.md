Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, the grid is represented by n lines of n characters (each character is either '0' or '1'), the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in the string `b` if `b` contains at least one '1'. If `b` does not contain any '1', `k` remains an empty list, `b` is an input string.** 

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the value of the input string provided by the user. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
