You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid. Each grid is represented by n lines of n characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()

    #State: After all iterations, `i` is equal to `a`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The variable `_` is 0, indicating that the inner loop has completed all iterations for each test case. The list `k` contains the counts of '1' characters from each input string `b` where '1' was present, in the order the inputs were received. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and the grid remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `b` is the last input string provided during the final iteration. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the condition holds true, and "SQUARE" is printed. Otherwise, "TRIANGLE" is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `a`. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of input, storing only those lines that contain at least one '1' in a list `k`.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The function checks if the first and second elements of `k` (which store the counts of '1's in the respective rows) are equal.
   - If they are equal, it prints 'SQUARE', indicating that the shape is a square.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE', indicating that the shape is a triangle.

3. **Assumptions and Edge Cases**:
   - The problem guarantees that the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.
   - The function correctly identifies the shape based on the pattern of '1's in the first two rows that contain '1's.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function assumes that the first two rows containing '1's will be sufficient to determine the shape. This is generally true for the given constraints and problem description.
   - However, the function does not explicitly check for the exact structure of the triangle or square beyond the first two rows. This could be a potential issue if the input were more complex, but given the constraints, it should work correctly.

Given the problem constraints and the simplicity of the shapes (triangle and square), the function appears to correctly identify the shape based on the provided logic.
