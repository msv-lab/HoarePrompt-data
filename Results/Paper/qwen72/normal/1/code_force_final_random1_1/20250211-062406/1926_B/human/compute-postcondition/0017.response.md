Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, the grid is represented by n lines of n characters (each character is either '0' or '1'), the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in each input string `b` that contained at least one '1'. If no input strings contained any '1', `k` remains an empty list.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- For each iteration, the variable `b` is assigned a new input string.
- If the string `b` contains at least one '1', the count of '1's in `b` is appended to the list `k`.
- After all `t` iterations, the list `k` will contain the counts of '1's from each input string that had at least one '1'.
- If none of the input strings contained any '1', the list `k` will remain empty.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
