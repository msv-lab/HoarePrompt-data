The code snippet `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of the character '1' in the string `b` to the list `k`. Since `k` remains unchanged in the initial state, it implies that `k` is already a list before this operation. The value of `b` is a user input string, and the count of '1' in `b` is added to `k`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`_` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` is a user input string, `k` is a list that now includes the count of '1' in `b` as its last element.**
