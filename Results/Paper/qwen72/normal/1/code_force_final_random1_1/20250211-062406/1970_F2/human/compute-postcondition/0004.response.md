Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be tuples or lists containing two elements each. It returns a tuple of two values: the first value is the sum of the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, and the second value is the sum of the second element of `a` and the second element of `b`. The original values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. **
