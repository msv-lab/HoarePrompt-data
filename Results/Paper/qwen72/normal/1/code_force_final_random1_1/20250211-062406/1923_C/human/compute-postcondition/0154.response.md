Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `m` is 0, `a` and `b` are the last values provided by the user input, `i` is equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]` with the final values of `a` and `b`, and `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]` with the final values of `a` and `b`. The conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' are evaluated based on these final values of `a` and `b`. All other variables (`n`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `j`) remain unchanged.**
