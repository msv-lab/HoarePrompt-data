To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m`.
   - `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers with all elements processed.
   - `p` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative sum of elements in `l`.
   - `c` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative count of `1`s encountered in `l`.
   - `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
   - `j` is the total count of `1`s in `l`.
   - `a` and `b` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `b` must be greater than 0.
   - `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('YES')`.

Given the initial state and the context, the print statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement because it is a static string.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **YES**
