The code snippet `c.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `c`.

- `j` is 1 if the second element in the list `l` is 1, otherwise `j` is 0.
- `c` initially is `[0, 0]`.

After appending `j` to `c`, the new value of `c` will be `[0, 0, j]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **_ is 0, `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 2 elements, `p` is `[0, 1, 1 + x]`, `c` is `[0, 0, j]`, `i` is `1 + x`, `j` is 1 if the second element in the list `l` is 1, otherwise `j` remains 0, `a` and `b` are the last input values for the indices, `s` is the sum of elements in the last processed sublist `l[a:b+1]`, `x` is the second element in the list `l`.**
