Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())`, `l` is a list of integers that must contain at least one more element, `p` is a list containing elements `[0, i, i+x]`, `c` is a list containing elements `[0, j, j]`, `i` is incremented by `x`, `j` is 3 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains 2, and `x` is the next element in `l`.***
