Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `i` is the first element of `l`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `p` is `[0, i]`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least two elements, `c` is `[0, j]`, `j` is 1 if the first element of `l` is 1, otherwise `j` is 0, and `x` is the second element of `l`. If `x` is 1, `j` is set to 1.***
