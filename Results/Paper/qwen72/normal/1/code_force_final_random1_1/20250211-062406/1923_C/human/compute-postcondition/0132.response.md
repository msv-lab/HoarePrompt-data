Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `i` is equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.** 

Explanation: The variable `i` is assigned the value of the difference between the element at index `b` in the list `c` and the element at index `a - 1` in the same list. The conditions that `m` must be greater than 0 and that `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input remain unchanged.
