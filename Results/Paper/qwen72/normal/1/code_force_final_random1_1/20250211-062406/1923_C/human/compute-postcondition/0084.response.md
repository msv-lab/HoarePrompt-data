Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `_` is 0 (This variable is not used in the print statement).
2. `m` is greater than 0 (This variable is also not used in the print statement).
3. `a` and `b` are integers from user input.
4. `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
5. `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
6. The difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than 1, which means `b - a + 1 > 1` or equivalently `b - a > 0` or `b > a`.
7. The value of `s` minus the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than or equal to `i`, which means `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

The print statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The conditions provided do not affect the content of the print statement directly. They only ensure that certain relationships between the variables `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s` hold true, but they do not change the string being printed.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
