Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with all elements processed, `p` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative sum of elements in `l`, `c` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative count of `1`s encountered in `l`, `i` is the count of `1`s in the sublist `l[a:b+1]`, `j` is the total count of `1`s in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `b` must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of elements in the sublist `l[a:b+1]`. If the length of the sublist `l[a:b+1]` is greater than 1 and the difference between the sum of elements in the sublist `l[a:b+1]` and the length of the sublist `l[a:b+1]` is greater than or equal to the count of `1`s in the sublist `l[a:b+1]`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either the length of the sublist `l[a:b+1]` is 1 or less, or the difference between the sum of elements in the sublist `l[a:b+1]` and the length of the sublist `l[a:b+1]` is less than the count of `1`s in the sublist `l[a:b+1]`.**
