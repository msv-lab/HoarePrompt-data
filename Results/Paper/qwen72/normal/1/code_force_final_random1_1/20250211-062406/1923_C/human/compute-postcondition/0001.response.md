The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1. After executing the given code, the values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the new input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())`.**
