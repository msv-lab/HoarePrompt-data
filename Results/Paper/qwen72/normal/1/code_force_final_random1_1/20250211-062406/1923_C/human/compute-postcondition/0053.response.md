The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0, this operation updates the values of `n` and `m` based on the new input.

The rest of the variables (`_`, `t`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `s`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with all elements processed, `p` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative sum of elements in `l`, `c` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative count of `1`s encountered in `l`, `i` is the count of `1`s in the last processed sublist `l[a:b+1]`, `j` is the total count of `1`s in `l`, `a` and `b` are the last input values for the indices, `s` is the sum of elements in the last processed sublist `l[a:b+1]`.**
