To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the given code snippet).
- `m` is greater than 1 (though this variable is not directly used in the given code snippet).
- `a` and `b` are integers from user input.
- `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

### Condition:
- If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met.
- Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 â‰¤ 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` means that the range between `a` and `b` must contain more than one element.
   - The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` means that the difference between `s` and the length of the range `(b - a + 1)` must be greater than or equal to `i`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print('YES')` statement will execute if the condition is met.
   - If the condition is not met, the code snippet does not specify any other action, so we assume that nothing else is printed.

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions, if the condition `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is true, the `print('YES')` statement will execute and print "YES". If the condition is not met, no output is specified, but since the question asks what will be printed, we assume the condition is met.

Output: **YES**
