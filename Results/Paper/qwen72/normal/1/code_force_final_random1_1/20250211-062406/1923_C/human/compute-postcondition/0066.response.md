Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 2 elements, `p` is `[0, 1]`, `c` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `a` and `b` are the last input values for the indices, `s` is the sum of elements in the last processed sublist `l[a:b+1]`, `x` is the second element in the list `l`.** 

The value of `j` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
