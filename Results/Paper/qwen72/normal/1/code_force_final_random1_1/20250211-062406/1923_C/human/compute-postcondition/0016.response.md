Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())`, `l` is a list of integers that must contain at least two elements, `p` is a list containing elements `[0, i]`, `c` is a list containing elements `[0, j]`. If `x` is 1, `i` is 1 and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1.***
