To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables directly involved in the loop head, which are `_` and `m`.

- The variable `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1.
- The variable `m` is derived from `int(input().split())` and must also be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1.
- `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())`.
- `l` is a list of integers with all elements processed.
- `p` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative sum of elements in `l`.
- `c` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative count of `1`s encountered in `l`.
- `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `j` is the total count of `1`s in `l`.

For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0, and `_` must be at least 1 (which is already given). Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `m` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with all elements processed, `p` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative sum of elements in `l`, `c` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative count of `1`s encountered in `l`, `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, and `j` is the total count of `1`s in `l`.**
