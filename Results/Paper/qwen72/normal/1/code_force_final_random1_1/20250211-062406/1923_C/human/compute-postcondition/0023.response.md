Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())`, `l` is a list of integers that must contain at least one more element, `p` is a list containing elements `[0, i, i+x]`, `c` is a list containing elements `[0, j, j]`, `i` is incremented by `x`, `j` is 3 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains 2, and `x` is the next element in `l`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by `x`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `j`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `x` is the next element in the list `l`.
- The value of `j` is determined based on the value of `x`: if `x` is 1, `j` is 3; otherwise, `j` remains 2.
- The list `p` contains elements `[0, i, i+x]`, reflecting the updated value of `i`.
- The list `c` contains elements `[0, j, j]`, reflecting the updated value of `j`.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `i` and potentially `j`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
