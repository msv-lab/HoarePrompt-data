Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m`, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with all elements processed, `p` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative sum of elements in `l`, `c` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative count of `1`s encountered in `l`, `i` is the count of `1`s in the sublist `l[a:b+1]`, `j` is the total count of `1`s in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `b` must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of elements in the sublist `l[a:b+1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`.
- The values of `a` and `b` are now derived from the input, and they must satisfy the condition that `b` is greater than 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `s`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values or conditions.
