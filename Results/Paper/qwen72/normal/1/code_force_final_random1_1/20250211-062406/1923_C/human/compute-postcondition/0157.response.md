Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of integers and a set of queries. For each query, it determines whether a specific condition is met within a specified range of the list and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The function reads input from the user for the number of test cases, the size of the list, the list itself, and the queries. It maintains internal state for each test case but resets it for the next test case. The final state after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed, and the appropriate 'YES' or 'NO' responses have been printed for each query. **
