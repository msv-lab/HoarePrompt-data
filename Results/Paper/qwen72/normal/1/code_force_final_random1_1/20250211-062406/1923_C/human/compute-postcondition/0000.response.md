To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` and `q` are integers where \(1 \leq n, q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\).
- For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers where \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n\).
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\), and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the number of test cases, which is read from input and stored in the variable `_`.
- The loop will execute if the number of test cases (`t`) is at least 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is derived from the input.
- To ensure the loop executes, the input must provide a value for `t` that is at least 1.

### Final State:
- The state before the loop starts should ensure that the input provides a valid number of test cases (`t`).

State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1**.
