The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial state, let's determine the new value of `j` and the resulting state:

- `j` is initially 1 or 2 depending on the value of `x` (if `x` is 1, `j` is 2; otherwise, `j` is 1).
- After executing `j += 1`, the value of `j` will be:
  - If `x` is 1, `j` was 2, so now `j` is 3.
  - If `x` is not 1, `j` was 1, so now `j` is 2.

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())`, `l` is a list of integers that must contain at least one more element, `p` is a list containing elements `[0, i, i+x]`, `c` is a list containing elements `[0, j, j]`, `i` is incremented by `x`, `j` is 3 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 2, `x` is the next element in `l`.**
