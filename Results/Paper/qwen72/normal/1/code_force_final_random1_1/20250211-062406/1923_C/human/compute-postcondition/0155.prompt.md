Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [0]
    c = [0]
    i, j = 0, 0
    for x in l:
        if x == 1:
            j += 1
        i += x
        p.append(i)
        c.append(j)
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
        s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
        if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is equal to `m`, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with all elements processed, `p` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative sum of elements in `l`, `c` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative count of `1`s encountered in `l`, `i` is the count of `1`s in the last processed sublist `l[a:b+1]`, `j` is the total count of `1`s in `l`, `a` and `b` are the last input values for the indices, `s` is the sum of elements in the last processed sublist `l[a:b+1]`. The loop has completed all `m` iterations, and the conditions for each iteration have been checked and printed accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is m-1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 ≤ 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `m` is 0, `a` and `b` are the last values provided by the user input, `i` is equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]` with the final values of `a` and `b`, and `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]` with the final values of `a` and `b`. The conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' are evaluated based on these final values of `a` and `b`. All other variables (`n`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `j`) remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
