The code snippet `c.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `c`. Based on the initial state, `j` is 3 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains 2. The list `c` initially contains elements `[0, j, j]`.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1.
   - `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())`.
   - `l` is a list of integers that must contain at least one more element.
   - `p` is a list containing elements `[0, i, i + x, i]`.
   - `c` is a list containing elements `[0, j, j]`.
   - `i` is incremented by `x`.
   - `j` is 3 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains 2.
   - `x` is the next element in `l`.

2. **Code Impact**:
   - The value of `j` (which is either 3 or 2) is appended to the list `c`.

3. **Updated State**:
   - `c` now contains `[0, j, j, j]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())`, `l` is a list of integers that must contain at least one more element, `p` is a list containing elements `[0, i, i + x, i]`, `i` is incremented by `x`, `j` is 3 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains 2, `x` is the next element in `l`, and `c` is a list containing elements `[0, j, j, j]`.**
