Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It processes the input to precompute prefix sums (`p`) and the count of ones (`c`), which allows it to efficiently answer each query. The logic for determining whether a subarray is "good" is implemented correctly according to the problem's conditions. Specifically, it checks if the subarray has more than one element and if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is at least the number of ones in the subarray, which aligns with the requirement that there exists a corresponding array `b` where each element is different from the corresponding element in `a` and is positive.
