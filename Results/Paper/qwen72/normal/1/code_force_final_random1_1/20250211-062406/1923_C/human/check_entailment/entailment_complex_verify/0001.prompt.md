You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is decremented by the number of test cases executed, `m` is 0 for the current test case, `a` and `b` are the last values provided by the user input for the current test case, `i` is equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]` with the final values of `a` and `b`, and `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]` with the final values of `a` and `b`. The conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' are evaluated based on these final values of `a` and `b`. All other variables (`n`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `j`) remain unchanged for the current test case, but will be reinitialized for the next test case if any.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of integers and a set of queries. For each query, it determines whether a specific condition is met within a specified range of the list and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The function reads input from the user for the number of test cases, the size of the list, the list itself, and the queries. It maintains internal state for each test case but resets it for the next test case. The final state after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed, and the appropriate 'YES' or 'NO' responses have been printed for each query.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if a subarray `c[l..r]` is "good" based on the given conditions.
   - A subarray is "good" if there exists another array `b` of the same length such that:
     1. The sum of elements in `c[l..r]` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
     2. No element in `c[l..r]` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
     3. All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For a subarray to be "good", it must be possible to construct `b` such that the sum condition holds and no element in `b` is equal to the corresponding element in `c[l..r]`.
   - If the subarray has at least one element that is not 1, we can always construct `b` by incrementing or decrementing the elements in `c[l..r]` to ensure they are different and positive.
   - If the subarray consists entirely of 1s, it is impossible to construct `b` because any change would violate the sum condition or the positivity condition.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `m`.
   - It reads the array `l` and initializes two prefix sum arrays `p` and `c`:
     - `p` stores the prefix sums of the array `l`.
     - `c` stores the count of 1s up to each index.
   - For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray `c[l..r]` and the count of 1s in the subarray.
   - It checks if the subarray is "good" by ensuring:
     - The length of the subarray is greater than 1.
     - The sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of 1s in the subarray.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly calculates the prefix sums and the count of 1s.
   - The logic for checking if the subarray is "good" is correct:
     - If the subarray has more than one element and the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of 1s, it is "good".
     - Otherwise, it is not "good".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
