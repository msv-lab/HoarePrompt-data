The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is used as a placeholder and is initialized to 0, but its initial value does not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0, and `_` can remain 0 as it is just a placeholder.

State: **_ is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
