Reasoning:  
The program correctly processes the input according to the problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Reading and Function Call**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the command string `s`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - Initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements of `a` in the order they are processed.
     - Sets `l` to 0 and `r` to `n-1` to keep track of the current indices for removing elements from the left and right, respectively.
   - **Processing Commands**:
     - Iterates through each command in `s`.
     - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements `r`.
   - **Calculating the Result**:
     - Initializes an empty list `ans` to store the results.
     - Initializes `p` to 1 to keep track of the cumulative product.
     - Iterates through the elements of `b` in reverse order.
     - For each element, updates `p` to be the product of `p` and the current element, modulo `m`.
     - Appends the current value of `p` to `ans`.
   - **Returning the Result**:
     - Returns the reversed list `ans`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases.
   - The order of elements in `b` is determined by the commands in `s`, and the cumulative product is calculated correctly.
   - The final result is reversed to match the required output format.

Given this analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
