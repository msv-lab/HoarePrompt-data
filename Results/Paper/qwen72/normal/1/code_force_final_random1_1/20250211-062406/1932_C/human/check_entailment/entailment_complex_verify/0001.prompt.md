You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a reversed list `ans`, which contains `n` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the cumulative product of the elements in `b` from the last to the current index, taken modulo `m`. The list `ans` is reversed, meaning the first element of the returned list corresponds to the last element of the original `ans` list, and so on.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters). It returns a list of `n` integers, where each integer is the cumulative product of the elements in a reordered list `b` from the last to the current index, taken modulo `m`. The list `b` is constructed by rearranging the elements of `a` based on the characters in `s`: if `s[i]` is 'L', the element from the start of `a` is added to `b`; if `s[i]` is 'R', the element from the end of `a` is added to `b`. The final list is reversed before being returned.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for each test case. It takes `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` as parameters.

3. **Command Processing**:
   - The program initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to track the left and right ends of the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and appends the appropriate element to the list `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'. This part correctly simulates the removal of elements from the array `a`.

4. **Product Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will be used to keep track of the product of the remaining elements.
   - It iterates through the list `b` in reverse order, updating the product `p` with the current element modulo `m` and appending the result to the list `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the reversed list `ans`, which ensures that the results are in the correct order (from the first command to the last command).
   - The main loop prints the results for each test case using the `print` function with the `*` operator to unpack the list.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1 or when all commands are the same ('L' or 'R').

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program efficiently processes the commands and calculates the product modulo `m` without recalculating the entire product from scratch each time, which is crucial for large inputs.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality and handle the problem constraints.
