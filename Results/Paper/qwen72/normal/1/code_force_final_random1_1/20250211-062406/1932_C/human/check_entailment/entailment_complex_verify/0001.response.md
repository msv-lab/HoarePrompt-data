Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`. This part is accurate and matches the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for each test case. It takes `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` as parameters. This is also correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

3. **Command Processing**:
   - The program initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to track the left and right ends of the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and appends the appropriate element to the list `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'. This part correctly simulates the removal of elements from the array `a`. The annotations confirm that `b` is constructed correctly based on the commands in `s`.

4. **Product Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will be used to keep track of the product of the remaining elements.
   - It iterates through the list `b` in reverse order, updating the product `p` with the current element modulo `m` and appending the result to the list `ans`. This approach ensures that the product is calculated efficiently and correctly, as it avoids recalculating the entire product from scratch each time.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the reversed list `ans`, which ensures that the results are in the correct order (from the first command to the last command). The main loop prints the results for each test case using the `print` function with the `*` operator to unpack the list. This is correct and matches the expected output format.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1 or when all commands are the same ('L' or 'R'). The annotations confirm that the program behaves correctly in these scenarios.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program efficiently processes the commands and calculates the product modulo `m` without recalculating the entire product from scratch each time, which is crucial for large inputs. This is confirmed by the annotations and the logic of the program.

Given the above reasoning and the detailed annotations, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality and handle the problem constraints.

Final: **True**
