Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing either the first two elements of `a` if `s[0]` is 'L' and `s[i]` is 'L', or the last two elements of `a` if `s[0]` is 'R' and `s[i]` is 'L'. If `s[i]` is 'R', `b` contains either the first element of `a` and the second-to-last element of `a` if `s[0]` is 'L', or the last element of `a` and the second-to-last element of `a` if `s[0]` is 'R'. `l` is 2 if `s[0]` is 'L' and `s[i]` is 'L', or 1 if `s[0]` is 'L' and `s[i]` is 'R', or 0 if `s[0]` is 'R'. `r` is `n - 1` if `s[0]` is 'L' and `s[i]` is 'L', or `n - 2` if `s[0]` is 'L' and `s[i]` is 'R', or `n - 2` if `s[0]` is 'R' and `s[i]` is 'L', or `n - 3` if `s[0]` is 'R' and `s[i]` is 'R'. `i` is 1.**
