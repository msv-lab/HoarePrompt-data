Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the issue lies in how the function processes the commands and calculates the remainders of the products. The function should calculate the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` before each removal operation, but instead, it incorrectly appends the elements being removed to the list `b` and then calculates the product in reverse order. This approach does not match the required sequence of operations.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the product of the current array modulo m
        for j in range(l, r + 1):
            product = (product * a[j]) % m
        b.append(product)
        
        # Update the product to exclude the element being removed
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[l], m-2, m)) % m  # Inverse modulo
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[r], m-2, m)) % m  # Inverse modulo
            r -= 1
    
    return b
```

This corrected function maintains the product of the current array and updates it correctly by removing the effect of the element being removed using modular inverse. This ensures that the product is calculated correctly at each step.
