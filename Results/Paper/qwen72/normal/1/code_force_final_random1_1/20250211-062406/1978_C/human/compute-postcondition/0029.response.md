Output State: **After all iterations, `n` remains a positive integer, `k` is reduced by a series of subtractions based on the loop's decrement pattern, `l` is the result of multiple calls to `func_3` with increasing `c` values, `c` equals the number of iterations completed, and `i` is the final value of the loop counter which is `-1` or the last even number before `-1` depending on the initial value of `n`. The loop terminates when `k` is no longer greater than or equal to `i - 1`, or when `i` becomes `-1`.**

To break it down:
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `k` is reduced by `i - 1` in each iteration, where `i` starts from `n` and decreases by 2 each time.
- `l` is modified by `func_3` in each iteration, with `c` incrementing by 1 each time.
- `c` will be equal to the number of iterations the loop completes.
- `i` will be `-1` or the last even number before `-1` depending on whether `n` is odd or even.
- The loop terminates either when `k` is no longer greater than or equal to `i - 1`, or when `i` reaches `-1`.
