Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is `k - n + 3`, and the list `l` has `x` inserted at the beginning and the last two elements removed. If `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned as is, but with `x` no longer being the last element. If `1 + i` is greater than `k` and `k` is not 0, `x` is also inserted at the position `-k` in the list `l`, and the last three elements are removed. The list `l` does not contain `x` at any other position.***
