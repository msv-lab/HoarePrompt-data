Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Validation (`func_4`)**:
   - The function `func_4` reads the input values `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `k` is even. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating an invalid input.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` based on `n` and checks if `k` is within the valid range. If `k` is out of range, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - If `k` is valid, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Generation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `l` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iterates over the list, attempting to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value `k`.
   - It uses `func_3` to swap elements in the list to reduce `k` by a certain amount.
   - If `k` becomes zero, it returns the current permutation.
   - If `k` is less than the next decrement value, it calls `func_2` to make a final adjustment.
   - The function ensures that the permutation is adjusted correctly to match the required Manhattan value.

3. **Output Handling (`func_5`)**:
   - The function `func_5` prints "YES" followed by the elements of the permutation list `l`.
   - It ensures that the permutation is printed in the correct format.

4. **Main Function (`func_6`)**:
   - The function `func_6` calls `func_4` to get valid `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and exits.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then `func_5` to print the result.

The overall logic of the program is sound and follows the problem description. Each function performs its intended task correctly, and the flow of the program ensures that the permutation is generated and printed as required.

Correctness: **True**
