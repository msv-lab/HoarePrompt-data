Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case, calling `func_6()` for each one. This part is correct as it handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

2. **Validation of `n` and `k`**: 
   - `func_4()` checks if `k` is even and within the possible range for the given `n`. If `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for the given `n`, it returns `(0, 0)`, which correctly indicates that no valid permutation exists.
   - The calculation of `max_k` is correct for both even and odd `n`.

3. **Permutation Generation**:
   - `func_1()` attempts to generate a permutation with the desired Manhattan value `k`.
   - It initializes a list `l` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iterates backward, swapping elements to increase the Manhattan value until `k` is reduced to zero or less.
   - The logic for swapping elements and reducing `k` is correct, ensuring that the Manhattan value is adjusted appropriately.

4. **Swapping Functions**:
   - `func_2()` and `func_3()` handle specific swaps to adjust the permutation and the Manhattan value. These functions are called correctly based on the current state of `k` and the iteration index.

5. **Output**:
   - `func_5()` prints the permutation if a valid one is found, or "NO" if no valid permutation exists. This matches the expected output format.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where `k` is zero or very large, and where `n` is small (e.g., `n = 1`).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles input validation, permutation generation, and output formatting correctly.

Correctness: **True**
