The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and `k` is a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value such that 0 <= k <= 10^12. The function returns a modified list `l` based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: If the conditions for the other cases are not met, the function returns the list `l` (with an unknown initial state).
- **Case_2**: The function returns the list `l` with the element `x` inserted at the position `-k`.
- **Case_3**: The function returns the list `l` with `x` inserted at the beginning and the last element removed.
- **Case_4**: The function returns the list `l` with `x` inserted at the beginning and the last element removed, and `x` is also inserted at the position `-k`, where `1 + i` is less than or equal to `k`, and `i` is `n - 2`. If `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned as is.
- **Case_5**: The function returns the modified list `l` with `x` inserted at the beginning, the last two elements removed, and if `1 + i` is greater than `k`, `x` is also inserted at the position `-k`. If `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned as is, but with `x` no longer being the last element.
- **Case_6**: The function returns the list `l` with `x` inserted at the beginning and at the position `-k`, and the last three elements removed. The list `l` does not contain `x` at any other position.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and `k` is a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value. It returns a modified list `l` based on specific conditions involving the insertion and removal of elements, particularly focusing on the position `-k` and the presence of the element `x`.**
