Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `k` is now `(k // 2) - 2 * (n - 3)`, `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, `c` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, and `k` is still greater than or equal to `i - 1`. If `k` is 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(2, l)` where `l` was modified from its initial state. If `k` is less than `i - 1`, the program returns the result of `func_2(2, k, l)`.**
