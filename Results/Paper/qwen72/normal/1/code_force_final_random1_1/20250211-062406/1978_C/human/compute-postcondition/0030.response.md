The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and `k` is a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value such that 0 <= k <= 10^12. The function returns different results based on the conditions:

- **Case_1**: If certain conditions are met, the function returns a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- **Case_2**: If other conditions are met, the function returns the result of calling `func_2` with arguments `c` set to 1, `k` set to `k // 2`, and `l` set to a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- **Case_3**: If specific conditions are met, the function returns the result of calling `func_3(1, l)`, where `l` was initially a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- **Case_4**: If certain conditions are met, the function returns the result of calling `func_2(2, k, l)`, where `k` is `(k // 2) - (i - 1)` and `l` is the result of `func_3(1, l)`. If `k` is 0, the function returns the result of `func_3(1, l)`.
- **Case_5**: If specific conditions are met, the function returns the result of calling `func_3(2, l)`, where `l` is the result of calling `func_3(2, l)`.
- **Case_6**: If certain conditions are met, the function returns the result of calling `func_2(3, k, l)`, where `k` is `(k // 2) - 2 * (n - 3)` and `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`. If `k` is 0, the function returns the result of `func_3(2, l)`.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer. It returns a list or the result of calling other functions (`func_2` or `func_3`) based on the value of `k` and the internal logic of the function.**
