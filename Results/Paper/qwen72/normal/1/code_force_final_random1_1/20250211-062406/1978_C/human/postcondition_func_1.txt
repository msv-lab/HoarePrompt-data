The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `c` (a non-negative integer), `k` (an integer), and `l` (a list of integers with a length of at least `c + k + 1`). It swaps the elements at positions `-c - k` and `-c` in the list `l`. After the function executes, the list `l` is returned with these two elements swapped. The element originally at position `-c - k` is now at position `-c`, and the element originally at position `-c` is now at position `-c - k`.
