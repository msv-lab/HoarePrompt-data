To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `k` is now `(k // 2) - 2 * (n - 3)`.
- `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`.
- `c` is 2.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `k` is still greater than or equal to `i - 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n, -1, -2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1` and decreases by 2 each iteration.

### Current State:
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `n` remains a positive integer.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted according to the loop's step and condition.
- The next value of `i` will be `i - 2`, which is `(n - 2) - 2 = n - 4`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` will be `n - 4`.
- `n` remains unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `k` is now `(k // 2) - 2 * (n - 3)`, `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, `c` is 2, `i` is `n - 4`, and `k` is still greater than or equal to `i - 1`.**
