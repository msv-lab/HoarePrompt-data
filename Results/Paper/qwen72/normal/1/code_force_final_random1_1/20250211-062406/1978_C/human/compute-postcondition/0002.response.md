The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a string literal `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `n` and `k`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the content of the `print` statement is independent of the values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **NO**
