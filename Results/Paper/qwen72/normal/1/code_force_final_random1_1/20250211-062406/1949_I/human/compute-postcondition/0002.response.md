Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers where for each i (0 ≤ i < n), `r[i]` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9, `visited` is a list of booleans initialized to False for each element, and `coef` is a list of None values, which will later be assigned integer values.**

Explanation:
- The code `y = [None] * n` reassigns the list `y` to a new list of `None` values of length `n`.
- All other variables (`n`, `x`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
