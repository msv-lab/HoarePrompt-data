Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef[i] = 1
        tot = 0
        bipartite = True
        dfs(i)
        ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n` except possibly `visited[n-1]` which may be `True` if `visited[n-1]` was initially `False`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except possibly `coef[n-1]` which may be 1 if `visited[n-1]` was initially `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list where `visited[i]` is `True` and other elements may be `True` or `False` depending on the traversal, `coef` is a list where `coef[i]` is 1 and other elements may be 1 or `None` depending on the traversal, `i` is `n-2`, `tot` is updated based on the DFS traversal (specific value depends on the implementation), `bipartite` is `True` or `False` depending on the graph structure, `ok` is `True` if `ok` was initially `True` or if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` is `False`. If `visited[i]` was initially `True`, the values of `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list where `visited[i]` is `True` and other elements may be `True` or `False` depending on the traversal, `coef` is a list where `coef[i]` is 1 and other elements may be 1 or `None` depending on the traversal, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is updated based on the DFS traversal (specific value depends on the implementation), `bipartite` is `True` or `False` depending on the graph structure, `ok` is `True` if `ok` was initially `True` or if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` is `False`. If `visited[i]` was initially `True`, the values of `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` remain unchanged. If `visited[i]` was initially `False`, more elements in `visited` are marked as `True`, more elements in `coef` are set to 1 or other values, `tot` is greater than 0, and `ok` is `True` if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
