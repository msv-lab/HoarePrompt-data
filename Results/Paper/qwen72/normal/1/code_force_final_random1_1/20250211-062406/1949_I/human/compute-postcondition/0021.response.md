To address the given task, we need to simulate the execution of the `dfs(i)` function call based on the provided initial state. Since the actual implementation of the `dfs` function is not provided, we will make reasonable assumptions about its behavior based on common DFS (Depth-First Search) implementations.

### Assumptions:
1. `dfs(i)` is a function that performs a depth-first search starting from the node indexed by `i`.
2. During the DFS, nodes are marked as visited by setting `visited[i]` to `True`.
3. The function may modify other variables like `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` based on the conditions encountered during the search.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- `x` is a list of `n` integers
- `y` is a list of `n` integers
- `r` is a list of `n` integers
- `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`
- `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `coef[n-1]` which is 1
- `i` is `n-1`
- `tot` is 0
- `bipartite` is `True`
- `ok` is `False`
- The value of `visited[i]` is `False`

### Execution of `dfs(i)`:
1. The function `dfs(i)` starts with `i` being `n-1`.
2. `visited[i]` is set to `True`.
3. Depending on the structure of the graph and the conditions within the DFS, other variables might be updated.

### Updated State:
- `visited[n-1]` is now `True`.
- The value of `coef[n-1]` remains 1.
- The values of `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` might be updated based on the DFS logic, but without the specific implementation, we cannot determine their exact values. However, we assume they remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the DFS.

### Output State:
**`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n` except `visited[n-1]` which is `True`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `coef[n-1]` which is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.**
