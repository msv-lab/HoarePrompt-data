Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `i` is `n-1`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all `n` iterations:
- The variable `n` remains the same as it was initially.
- The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` now contain `n` integers each, with each integer corresponding to the input provided during each iteration of the loop.
- The list `visited` remains a list of `False` values of length `n`.
- The list `coef` remains a list of `None` values of length `n`.
- The loop index `i` is `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration.
