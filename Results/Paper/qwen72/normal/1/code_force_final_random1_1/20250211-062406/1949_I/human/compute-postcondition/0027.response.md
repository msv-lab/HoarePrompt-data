Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n` except possibly `visited[n-1]` which may be `True` if `visited[n-1]` was initially `False`, `coef` is a list where `coef[i]` is 1 and the rest are `None` values except possibly `coef[n-1]` which may be 1 if `visited[n-1]` was initially `False`, `i` is `n-2`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `bipartite = True` sets the variable `bipartite` to `True`. Since `bipartite` was already `True` in the initial state, no actual change occurs. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
