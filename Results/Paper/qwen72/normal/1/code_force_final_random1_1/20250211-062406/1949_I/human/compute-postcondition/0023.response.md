Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n` except possibly `visited[n-1]` which may be `True` if `visited[n-1]` was initially `False`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except possibly `coef[n-1]` which may be 1 if `visited[n-1]` was initially `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.***
