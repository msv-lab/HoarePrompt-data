Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `visited` is a list of booleans initialized to False for each element, and `coef` is a list of None values, which will later be assigned integer values.**

Explanation: The code snippet `r = [None] * n` reassigns the list `r` to a new list of `None` values of length `n`. This overwrites the previous values of `r` which were integers within the range 1 ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9. All other variables remain unchanged.
