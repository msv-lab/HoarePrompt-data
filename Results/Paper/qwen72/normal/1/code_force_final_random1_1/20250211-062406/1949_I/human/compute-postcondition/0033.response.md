Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list where `visited[i]` is `True` and other elements may be `True` or `False` depending on the traversal, `coef` is a list where `coef[i]` is 1 and other elements may be 1 or `None` depending on the traversal, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True` or `False` depending on the graph structure, `ok` is `True` if `ok` was initially `True` or if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` is `False`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet sets `tot` to 0, which overrides any previous value that `tot` might have had. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
