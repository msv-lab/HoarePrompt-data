The code snippet `tot = 0` reassigns the value of `tot` to 0. Since `tot` was already 0 in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n` except possibly `visited[n-1]` which may be `True` if `visited[n-1]` was initially `False`, `coef` is a list where `coef[i]` is 1 and the rest are `None` values except possibly `coef[n-1]` which may be 1 if `visited[n-1]` was initially `False`, `i` is `n-2`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.**
