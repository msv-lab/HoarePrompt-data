The code snippet `x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the elements at index `i` (which is 2) of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r`.

Let's break down the changes:

- `x[2]` is updated to the first integer from the input.
- `y[2]` is updated to the second integer from the input.
- `r[2]` is updated to the third integer from the input.

The other variables and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 1000, `x` is a list where the first element is an input integer, the second element is an input integer, and the third element is an input integer, `y` is a list where the first element is an input integer, the second element is an input integer, and the third element is an input integer, `r` is a list where the first element is an input integer, the second element is an input integer, and the third element is an input integer, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `i` is 2.**
