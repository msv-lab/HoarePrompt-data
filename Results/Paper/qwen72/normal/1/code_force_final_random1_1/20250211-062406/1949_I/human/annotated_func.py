#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. x, y, and r are lists of integers where for each i (0 ≤ i < n), x[i] and y[i] are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x[i], y[i] ≤ 10^9, and r[i] is an integer such that 1 ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9. visited is a list of booleans initialized to False for each element. coef is a list of None values, which will later be assigned integer values.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())

    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `i` is `n-1`.

    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list where all elements are `True`, `coef` is a list where each element is either 1 or another value depending on the DFS traversal, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is the total count of nodes processed during the DFS traversals (specific value depends on the implementation), `bipartite` is `True` or `False` depending on whether the graph is bipartite, `ok` is `True` if the graph is bipartite and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` is `False`.
    if ok :

    #State: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list where all elements are `True`, `coef` is a list where each element is either 1 or another value depending on the DFS traversal, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is the total count of nodes processed during the DFS traversals (specific value depends on the implementation), `bipartite` is `True` or `False` depending on whether the graph is bipartite. If `ok` is `True`, the graph is bipartite and `tot` is not 0. If `ok` is `False`, the graph is not bipartite or `tot` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and three lists `x`, `y`, and `r` of length `n` from user input. It then processes these lists to determine if the graph represented by these lists is bipartite and if there are any nodes in the graph. The function updates a `visited` list to track visited nodes and a `coef` list to assign coefficients during the processing. After processing, the function prints 'YES' if the graph is bipartite and contains at least one node, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The final state of the program includes `visited` being fully marked as `True`, `coef` containing assigned integer values, and `tot` reflecting the number of nodes processed.
