Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 + 1, `n` is the first input integer greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer greater than 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 4, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` < `bOnes`, `aOnes` is increased by 1 and `bOnes` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `i` is in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` ≥ `bOnes`, `aOnes` remains unchanged and `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, and `aOnes` ≤ `newk`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1, and `bOnes` remains unchanged. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, and `bOnes` ≤ `newk`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1, and `aOnes` remains unchanged. If `i` is not in either `a` or `b`, both `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain unchanged, and the program may break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
