Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 2 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, and `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. Additionally, either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`. The current value of `i` is in `b` and the current value of `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`.**
