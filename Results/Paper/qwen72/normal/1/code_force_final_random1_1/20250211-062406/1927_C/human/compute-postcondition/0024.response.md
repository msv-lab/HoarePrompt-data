Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1 and `bOnes` remains 0. Otherwise, if `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`, and if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If neither of these conditions is met, `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain 0.***
