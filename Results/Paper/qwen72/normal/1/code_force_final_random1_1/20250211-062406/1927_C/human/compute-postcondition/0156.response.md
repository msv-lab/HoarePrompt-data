Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 + 1, `n` is the first input integer greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer greater than 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 4, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1, and `bOnes` remains unchanged. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, both `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain unchanged, and the program may break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
