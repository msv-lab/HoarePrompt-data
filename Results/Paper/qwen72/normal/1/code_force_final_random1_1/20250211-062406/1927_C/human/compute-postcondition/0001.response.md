The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into three parts, which are then converted to integers and assigned to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. Since `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0, each of `n`, `m`, and `k` will also be integers greater than 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0.**
