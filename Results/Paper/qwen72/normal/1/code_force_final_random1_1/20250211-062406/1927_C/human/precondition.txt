t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5), and k is an even integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m)). Arrays a and b contain n and m integers respectively, where each element is a positive integer (1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6).
