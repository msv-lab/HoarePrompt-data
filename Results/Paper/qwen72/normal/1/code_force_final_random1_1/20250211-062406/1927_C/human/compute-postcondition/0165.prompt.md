Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, and k is an even integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m). Arrays a and b contain n and m integers respectively, where each element is an integer in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    aOnes = 0
    bOnes = 0
    newk = k // 2
    i = 1
    while i <= k:
        if i in a and i in b:
            if aOnes < bOnes:
                aOnes += 1
            else:
                bOnes += 1
        elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
            aOnes += 1
        elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
            bOnes += 1
        else:
            break
        i += 1
    if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is the number of times `i` was in `a` and met the conditions for incrementing `aOnes`, `bOnes` is the number of times `i` was in `b` and met the conditions for incrementing `bOnes`. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b` and were counted up to `newk`, `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are also in `a` and were counted up to `newk`. The loop has completed all iterations, and the values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` reflect the counts of elements that meet the conditions specified in the loop. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 + 1, `n` is the first input integer greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer greater than 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `aOnes` is the count of elements in `a` that meet the conditions specified in the loop, and `bOnes` is the count of elements in `b` that meet the conditions specified in the loop. If `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
