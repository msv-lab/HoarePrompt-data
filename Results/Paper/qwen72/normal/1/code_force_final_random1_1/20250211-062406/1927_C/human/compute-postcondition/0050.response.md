Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is the number of times `i` was in `a` and met the conditions for incrementing `aOnes`, `bOnes` is the number of times `i` was in `b` and met the conditions for incrementing `bOnes`. Additionally, `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`.**
