Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b` and were counted up to `newk`, `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are also in `a` and were counted up to `newk`. The loop has completed all iterations, and the values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` reflect the counts of elements that meet the conditions specified in the loop. Additionally, `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`.**
