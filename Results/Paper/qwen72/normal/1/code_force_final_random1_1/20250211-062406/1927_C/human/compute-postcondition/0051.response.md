Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers input by the user.
- `newk` is defined as `k // 2`.
- `i` is defined as `k + 1`.
- `aOnes` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and meets certain conditions for incrementing `aOnes`.
- `bOnes` is the number of times `i` appears in `b` and meets certain conditions for incrementing `bOnes`.
- `aOnes` is equal to `newk`.
- `bOnes` is equal to `newk`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'yes'`. The conditions described do not affect the output of the `print` statement directly, but they imply that the conditions for printing `'yes'` have been met.

Output: **yes**
