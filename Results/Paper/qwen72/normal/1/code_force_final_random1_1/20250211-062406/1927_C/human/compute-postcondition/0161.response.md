Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 + 1.
- `n` is the first input integer greater than 0.
- `m` is the second input integer greater than 0.
- `k` is the third input integer greater than 0.
- `newk` is `k // 2`.
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `b` is a new list of integers input by the user.
- `aOnes` is the count of elements in `a` that meet the conditions specified in the loop.
- `bOnes` is the count of elements in `b` that meet the conditions specified in the loop.
- `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('yes')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'yes'` to the console. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it does not reference any of them.

Output: **yes**
