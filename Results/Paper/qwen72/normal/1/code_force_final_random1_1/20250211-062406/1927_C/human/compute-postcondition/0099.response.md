Output State: **`t` is an integer where 2 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 4, `k` must be greater than or equal to 4, `aOnes` and `bOnes` retain their previous values, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
