Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and `i` is present in both `a` and `b`. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is set to 1 and `bOnes` remains 0. Otherwise, if `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`, then `aOnes` remains 0 and `bOnes` is set to 1.***
