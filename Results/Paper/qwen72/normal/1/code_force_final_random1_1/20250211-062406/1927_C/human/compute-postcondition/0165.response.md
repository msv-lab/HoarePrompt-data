Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is the number of times `i` was in `a` and met the conditions for incrementing `aOnes`, `bOnes` is the number of times `i` was in `b` and met the conditions for incrementing `bOnes`. For each test case, if `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, the condition is met, and 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` are read from the input, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from the input.
- `newk` is calculated as `k // 2`.
- The inner while loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = k`, checking conditions and updating `aOnes` and `bOnes` accordingly.
- After the inner loop completes, if `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, 'yes' is printed; otherwise, 'no' is printed.
- This process repeats for all `t` test cases, and the final state reflects the results of all iterations.
