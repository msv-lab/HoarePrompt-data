Output State: **`t` is an integer where 2 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, `aOnes` and `bOnes` retain their previous values.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes`) remain unchanged.
