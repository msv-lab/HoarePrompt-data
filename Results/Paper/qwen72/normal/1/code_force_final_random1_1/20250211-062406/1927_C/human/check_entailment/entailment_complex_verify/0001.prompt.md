You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k
.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \frac{k}{2}
elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every
integer from 1 to k is included.

For example:

  * If a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5] , k=6 , then it is possible to choose elements with values 2, 3, 6 from array a and elements with values 1, 4, 5 from array b . In this case, all numbers from 1 to k=6 will be included among the chosen elements.
  * If a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3] , k=6 , then it is not possible to choose elements in the required way. 

Note that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements — your
program should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the
required way.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n, m \le 2\cdot10^5 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot \min(n, m) , k is even) — the length
of array a , the length of array b , and the number of elements to be chosen,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_j \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test
does not exceed 4 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to choose \frac{k}{2} numbers from
each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1
to k is included. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 2 , 3 , and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1 , 4 , and 5 from array b
. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.

In the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not
possible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.

In the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b . Thus, all
numbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.

    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is the number of times `i` was in `a` and met the conditions for incrementing `aOnes`, `bOnes` is the number of times `i` was in `b` and met the conditions for incrementing `bOnes`. For each test case, if `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, the condition is met, and 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and two arrays `a` and `b`. For each test case, it checks if it is possible to select `k/2` elements from array `a` and `k/2` elements from array `b` such that each selected element is unique and within the range `[1, k]`. If this condition is met, the function prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. Each test case consists of the lengths of two arrays `a` and `b`, and an even integer `k`.

2. **Initialization**: The variables `aOnes` and `bOnes` are initialized to zero. These variables are intended to count how many elements from 1 to `k` are found in arrays `a` and `b`, respectively. The variable `newk` is set to `k // 2`, which represents the number of elements that need to be chosen from each array.

3. **Loop Through Elements**: The loop iterates through the integers from 1 to `k`. For each integer `i`:
   - If `i` is present in both `a` and `b`, it increments the counter of the array with fewer elements already counted (`aOnes` or `bOnes`).
   - If `i` is present only in `a` and `aOnes` is less than `newk`, it increments `aOnes`.
   - If `i` is present only in `b` and `bOnes` is less than `newk`, it increments `bOnes`.
   - If `i` is not found in either array or the respective counter has reached `newk`, the loop breaks.

4. **Final Check**: After the loop, the function checks if both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`. If they are, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.

### Issues:
- **Edge Case Handling**: The logic assumes that if an element `i` is found in both arrays, it will always be added to the array with fewer elements. However, this might not always be the optimal choice. For example, if `aOnes` is already close to `newk` and `bOnes` is far behind, it might be better to add `i` to `bOnes` even if `aOnes` is currently smaller.
- **Break Condition**: The loop breaks as soon as it finds an element `i` that cannot be added to either `aOnes` or `bOnes`. This might lead to premature termination if the remaining elements can still be distributed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle edge cases optimally and may terminate prematurely. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Correctness:
**False**
