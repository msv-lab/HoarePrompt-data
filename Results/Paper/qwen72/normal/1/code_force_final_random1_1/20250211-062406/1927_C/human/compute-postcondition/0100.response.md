Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 4, `k` must be greater than or equal to 4, `aOnes` retains its previous value. If `i` (which is 4) is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` retains its previous value, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
