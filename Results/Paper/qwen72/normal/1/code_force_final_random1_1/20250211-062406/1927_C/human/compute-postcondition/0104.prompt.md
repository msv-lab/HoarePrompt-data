Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, `aOnes` and `bOnes` retain their previous values.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 4, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3. `aOnes` and `bOnes` retain their previous values.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 5, `k` must be greater than or equal to 4, `aOnes` and `bOnes` retain their previous values, and the program does not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
