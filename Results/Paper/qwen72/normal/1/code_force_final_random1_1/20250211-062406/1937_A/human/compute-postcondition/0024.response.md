Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n_cases` is greater than 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
  - If the input integer is 1, `n` remains 1.
  - Otherwise, `n` is set to the log2 of the input integer.
  - If `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is decremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `1`.
- The initial state and the conditions described do not affect the value being printed by the `print` statement because the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `i`, `n_cases`, `n`, or `power`.

Output: **1**
