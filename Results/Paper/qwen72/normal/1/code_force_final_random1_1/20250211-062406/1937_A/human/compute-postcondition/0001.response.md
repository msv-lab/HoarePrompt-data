To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n_cases`. The loop will execute if `n_cases` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0, and `n_cases` must be a positive integer.

State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0**
