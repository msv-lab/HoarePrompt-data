Output State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` is log2 of the input integer, `power` is equal to `n`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `power` is less than `n`.
- Each iteration of the loop increments `power` by 1.
- The loop will stop when `power` becomes equal to `n`.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `power` will be equal to `n`.
- The values of `i` and `n_cases` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
