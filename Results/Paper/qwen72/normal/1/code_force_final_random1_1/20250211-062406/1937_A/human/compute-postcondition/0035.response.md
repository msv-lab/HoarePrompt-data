Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n_cases` is greater than 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `power`.
- `power` is equal to `n`.
- The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `power`**: According to the initial state, `power` is equal to `n`.
2. **Value of `n`**: The initial state also states that `n` is greater than or equal to `power`, and since `power` is equal to `n`, it implies that `n` is equal to `power`.
3. **Expression `2 ** power`**: This expression calculates 2 raised to the power of `power`. Since `power` is equal to `n`, the expression becomes `2 ** n`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the result of `2 ** n`, where `n` is the value of `power`.

Output: **2 ** n (where n is the value of power)**
