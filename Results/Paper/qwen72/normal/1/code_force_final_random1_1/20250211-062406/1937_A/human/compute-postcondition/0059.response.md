Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 1. If `n` is 1, `power` is decremented by 1 if it is not equal to the input integer, otherwise it remains unchanged. If `n` is not 1, `n` is set to log2(n_cases). If `power` is equal to `n`, the value of `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1 and is no longer equal to `n`.***
