Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n_cases` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n` and prints that value. The function does not return any value; it only prints results to the console. **
