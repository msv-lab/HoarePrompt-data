Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1. If the input integer `n` is 1, `n` remains 1. If the input integer `n` is greater than 1, `n` is set to the log2 of the input integer. If `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is decremented by 1. If `power` is equal to `n`, the value of `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1 and is now `power` - 1.***
