### Reasoning

Let's analyze the program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer \( n \).
- The alphabet is indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1 and 'z' is 26.
- The sum of the indices of the letters in the word should equal \( n \).

#### Program Analysis
The program uses a series of conditions to construct the word based on the value of \( n \):

1. **If \( n > 52 \)**:
   - The program constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
   - This means the first letter is the character at position \( n - 53 \) in the alphabet, followed by 'zz'.
   - For example, if \( n = 55 \), the first letter is `alphabet[2]` which is 'b', so the word is 'bzz'.

2. **If \( n > 26 \)**:
   - The program constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
   - This means the first letter is 'a', the second letter is the character at position \( n - 28 \) in the alphabet, and the third letter is 'z'.
   - For example, if \( n = 50 \), the second letter is `alphabet[22]` which is 'v', so the word is 'avz'.

3. **If \( n \leq 26 \)**:
   - The program constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
   - This means the first two letters are 'aa', and the third letter is the character at position \( n - 3 \) in the alphabet.
   - For example, if \( n = 10 \), the third letter is `alphabet[7]` which is 'g', so the word is 'aag'.

#### Original Assessment
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it mentions that for \( n = 55 \), the program outputs 'czz' instead of the correct 'bzz'.

#### Verification
Let's verify the program's behavior for the given test cases:

1. **For \( n = 24 \)**:
   - \( n \leq 26 \)
   - Output: `'aa' + alphabet[24 - 3]` = `'aa' + 'v'` = 'aav'
   - Correct.

2. **For \( n = 70 \)**:
   - \( n > 52 \)
   - Output: `alphabet[70 - 53] + 'zz'` = `alphabet[17] + 'zz'` = 'rzz'
   - Correct.

3. **For \( n = 3 \)**:
   - \( n \leq 26 \)
   - Output: `'aa' + alphabet[3 - 3]` = `'aa' + 'a'` = 'aaa'
   - Correct.

4. **For \( n = 55 \)**:
   - \( n > 52 \)
   - Output: `alphabet[55 - 53] + 'zz'` = `alphabet[2] + 'zz'` = 'bzz'
   - Correct. The original assessment was incorrect here.

5. **For \( n = 48 \)**:
   - \( n > 26 \)
   - Output: `'a' + alphabet[48 - 28] + 'z'` = `'a' + alphabet[20] + 'z'` = 'auz'
   - Correct.

#### Conclusion
The program correctly handles all the test cases provided. The original assessment was incorrect in stating that the program outputs 'czz' for \( n = 55 \). The program actually outputs 'bzz', which is the correct lexicographically smallest word.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
