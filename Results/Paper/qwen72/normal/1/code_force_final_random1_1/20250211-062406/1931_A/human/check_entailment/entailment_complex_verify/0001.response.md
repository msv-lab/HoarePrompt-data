Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that sums up to a given integer `n`, where the sum is based on the position of each letter in the alphabet (1 for 'a', 2 for 'b', etc.).

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.

3. **Word Construction**:
   - **Case 1: `n > 52`**
     - The program constructs the word by adding the letter at position `n - 53` followed by "zz". This is because the maximum sum for "zzz" is 78 (26 + 26 + 26), and any `n` greater than 52 can be represented by a word starting with a letter from "r" to "z" followed by "zz".
     - Example: For `n = 70`, the word is "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26 = 70).
   - **Case 2: `27 <= n <= 52`**
     - The program constructs the word by adding "a" followed by the letter at position `n - 28` and then "z". This is because the maximum sum for "azz" is 52 (1 + 26 + 25), and any `n` in this range can be represented by a word starting with "a" followed by a letter from "a" to "y" and then "z".
     - Example: For `n = 55`, the word is "czz" (3 + 26 + 26 = 55).
   - **Case 3: `3 <= n <= 26`**
     - The program constructs the word by adding "aa" followed by the letter at position `n - 3`. This is because the maximum sum for "aaa" is 3 (1 + 1 + 1), and any `n` in this range can be represented by a word starting with "aa" followed by a letter from "a" to "z".
     - Example: For `n = 3`, the word is "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly. For example, when `n` is 3, it outputs "aaa" which is the smallest possible word.
   - When `n` is 78, it outputs "zzz" which is the largest possible word.

5. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The program ensures that the constructed word is lexicographically smallest by always starting with the smallest possible letters and incrementally increasing the value of the letters as needed.

6. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For `n = 24`, the program outputs "aav" (1 + 1 + 22 = 24).
   - For `n = 70`, the program outputs "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26 = 70).
   - For `n = 3`, the program outputs "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3).
   - For `n = 55`, the program outputs "czz" (3 + 26 + 26 = 55).
   - For `n = 48`, the program outputs "auz" (1 + 21 + 26 = 48).

Given the above reasoning and verification, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Final: **True**
