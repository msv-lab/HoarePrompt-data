Reasoning:  

The program aims to decode an integer back into a three-letter word, which is the lexicographically smallest word that can be encoded to the given integer. The logic in the program is designed to handle different ranges of the input integer `n` and construct the corresponding word accordingly.

1. **Range Handling**: 
   - For `n > 52`, the program constructs the word by taking the character at position `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. This is correct because the maximum possible value for a three-letter word is 78 ('zzz'), and the smallest word in this range is constructed correctly.
   - For `n > 26`, the program constructs the word by starting with 'a', followed by the character at position `n - 28`, and ending with 'z'. This is correct because it ensures the word is lexicographically smallest by starting with 'a'.
   - For `n <= 26`, the program constructs the word by starting with 'aa' followed by the character at position `n - 3`. This is correct because it ensures the word is lexicographically smallest by starting with 'aa'.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is at the boundaries of the ranges (e.g., `n = 53`, `n = 27`, `n = 3`).

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, which is consistent with the problem description.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest word for each test case, which is the expected behavior.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
