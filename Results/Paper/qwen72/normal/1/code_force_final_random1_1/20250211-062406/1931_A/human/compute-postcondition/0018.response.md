The code concatenates the string `'a'`, the character at index `n - 28` from the string `alphabet`, and the string `'z'` to the current value of `word`. Since `word` was initially an empty string, the new value of `word` will be `'a'` + `alphabet[n - 28]` + `'z'`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`**
