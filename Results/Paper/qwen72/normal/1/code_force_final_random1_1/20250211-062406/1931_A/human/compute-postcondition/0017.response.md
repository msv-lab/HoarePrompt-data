The value of `word` is updated by appending the character from the `alphabet` list at the index `n - 53` followed by the string `'zz'`. The previous value of `word` was an empty string, so now `word` contains the character from `alphabet[n - 53]` followed by `'zz'`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `word` is the string containing the character from `alphabet[n - 53]` followed by `'zz'`.**
