The function `func` reads multiple pairs of digit-only strings `x` and `y` from the standard input, up to `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each pair, it generates two new strings: one by taking the maximum digit at each position and another by taking the minimum digit at each position. It prints these two strings for each pair. The function does not return any value. After all iterations, the variable `t` is effectively reduced by the number of iterations performed, but the original input strings `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
