### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Digit Conversion**: For each test case, the function converts the input strings `a` and `b` into lists of integers. This is necessary because we need to manipulate individual digits.

3. **Initialization**: Two lists `new` and `new2` are initialized to store the resulting digits after the swaps. This is a good approach to keep track of the changes.

4. **Equality Check**: The function iterates through the digits of `a` and `b` and checks if they are equal. If they are equal, it assigns the same value to both `new` and `new2`. This is correct because swapping identical digits does not change the product.

5. **First Non-Equal Digit**: When the first non-equal digit is found, the function assigns the maximum of the two digits to `new` and the minimum to `new2`. This is correct because it ensures that the larger digit is placed in `new`, which helps in maximizing the product.

6. **Remaining Digits**: For the remaining digits, the function assigns the minimum of the two digits to `new` and the maximum to `new2`. This is also correct because it ensures that the smaller digit is placed in `new`, which helps in maximizing the product when combined with the previous steps.

7. **Output**: Finally, the function prints the resulting numbers as strings. This is correct as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem requirements and follows the logic to maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping digits. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
