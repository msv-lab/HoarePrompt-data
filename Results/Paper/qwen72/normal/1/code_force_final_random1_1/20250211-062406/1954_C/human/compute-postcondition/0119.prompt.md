You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, x and y are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        b = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        new = [None] * len(a)
        
        new2 = [None] * len(a)
        
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
        
        if i != len(a):
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
            while i < len(a):
                new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
                new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
                i += 1
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` is decremented by the number of iterations that were performed, but it remains within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The variables `x` and `y` are unchanged and still represent strings of integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. For each iteration, the lists `a` and `b` are updated with the digits from the new input strings `x` and `y`. The lists `new` and `new2` are generated for each iteration, where `new` contains the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for the first part of the list and the minimum value for the second part (if any), and `new2` contains the opposite. After all iterations, the final state of `a` and `b` will reflect the last input strings processed, and `new` and `new2` will be the final lists generated from these inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, an integer between 1 and 1000, and `x` and `y`, which are strings representing integers between 1 and less than 10^100, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. The function's return value is not specified, but it likely processes `x` and `y` in some way related to `t` and returns a result based on this processing.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
