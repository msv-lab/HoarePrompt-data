Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string `x`, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `b` is a list of integers derived from the new input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `i` is 1, `new` is a list of `None` values with length equal to `len(a)`, except the first element which is now `max(a[0], b[0])`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with length equal to `len(a)`, and the first element of `new2` is `min(a[0], b[0])`.**
