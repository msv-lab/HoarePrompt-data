To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - `i`: This is the loop index, initially set to 0.
   - `len(a)`: This is the length of the list `a`.
   - `a[i]`: The element at index `i` in list `a`.
   - `b[i]`: The element at index `i` in list `b`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` and `b` are lists of integers derived from the input strings `x` and `y`, respectively.
   - `len(a)` is the length of the list `a`.

3. **Condition Breakdown:**
   - The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
     - `i < len(a)`: This checks if the index `i` is within the bounds of the list `a`.
     - `a[i] == b[i]`: This checks if the elements at index `i` in lists `a` and `b` are equal.

4. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 0, which is always less than `len(a)` unless `a` is an empty list.
   - `a[0]` and `b[0]` are the first elements of the lists `a` and `b`, respectively.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `len(a)`, which is already true since `i` is 0.
   - Additionally, `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is 0 and `len(a)` is the length of the list `a`, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `a[0]` is equal to `b[0]`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `b` is a list of integers derived from the input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, `i` is 0, and `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`**.
