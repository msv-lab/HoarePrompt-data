To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which are `num` and `a`.

- The variable `num` is used to iterate over the elements in the list `a`.
- For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31.
- `res` is 0.
- `count` is an empty dictionary.

For the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least one element. Since `n` is a positive integer and `a` is a list of `n` elements, `a` will always have at least one element as long as `n` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n` or `a` to ensure the loop executes.

However, the state of `num` should be considered. Before the loop starts, `num` will take the value of the first element in the list `a`.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is 0, `count` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in the list `a`**
