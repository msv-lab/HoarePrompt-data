To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range` function, starting from 0.
2. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0, as this determines the number of iterations.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30.

However, these variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`) are not directly part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The only relevant variable in the loop head is `i`, and the condition for the loop to execute is that `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that the loop can execute at least once:

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
