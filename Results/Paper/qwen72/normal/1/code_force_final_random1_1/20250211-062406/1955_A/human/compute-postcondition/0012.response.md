The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `int(input())` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 1, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers from the input, and `int(input())` must be greater than 1. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, no changes are made to the variables. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and if `A` is even, no changes are made to the variables. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**
