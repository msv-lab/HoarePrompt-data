You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30, representing the number of yogurts to buy, the price per yogurt, and the promotional price for two yogurts, respectively.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `t - 1`, where `t` is the initial number of test cases. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` will be the last set of inputs read from the user. If `B * 2 < C`, no changes are made to `A`, `B`, or `C`. If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even, no changes are made to `A`, `B`, or `C`. If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum cost when the number of yogurts `A` is odd is flawed. The program incorrectly calculates the cost for the last yogurt when `A` is odd by adding the price of a single yogurt (`B`) to the total cost after purchasing pairs of yogurts at the promotion price. This approach may not always yield the minimum cost.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
3 5 8
```
- Here, `n = 3`, `a = 5`, and `b = 8`.
- The program will calculate the cost as follows:
  - `X = A // 2 = 1`
  - Total cost = `X * C + B = 1 * 8 + 5 = 13`
- However, the correct minimum cost should be `10` (buying two yogurts at the promotion price for `8` burles and one yogurt at the regular price for `2` burles).

Thus, the program does not always produce the correct minimum cost, making it incorrect.
