Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `A` is `a`
   - `B` is `b`
   - `C` is `c`
   - `X` is determined by the condition: `a // 2` if `b * 2 >= c` and `a` is odd; otherwise, no changes are made.

2. **Condition for `X`:**
   - If `b * 2 >= c` and `a` is odd, then `X = a // 2`.
   - Otherwise, `X` remains unchanged (which means `X` is not defined in this case).

3. **Evaluating the Condition:**
   - We need to check if `b * 2 >= c` and if `a` is odd.
   - If both conditions are true, `X` will be `a // 2`.
   - If either condition is false, `X` will remain undefined.

4. **Expression to Print:**
   - The expression to print is `X * C + B`.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Both Conditions are True
- `b * 2 >= c` is true.
- `a` is odd.
- In this case, `X = a // 2`.
- The expression becomes `X * C + B` which is `(a // 2) * c + b`.

### Scenario 2: Either Condition is False
- If `b * 2 < c` or `a` is even, `X` remains undefined.
- Since `X` is undefined, the expression `X * C + B` cannot be evaluated, and it would result in an error.

Given the initial state and the conditions, let's assume the most likely scenario where both conditions are true (since the problem does not specify otherwise):

- `a` is odd.
- `b * 2 >= c`.

Therefore, `X = a // 2`.

The expression to print is:
\[ X * C + B = (a // 2) * c + b \]

Output: **(a // 2) * c + b (where a is odd and b * 2 >= c)**
