Initial State: `i` is 2, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user input.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 2.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user input.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(int(A * C / 2))
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The expression inside the `print` statement is `int(A * C / 2)`.
2. `A` and `C` are integers provided by the user.
3. The product `A * C` is computed first.
4. The result of `A * C` is then divided by 2.
5. The `int()` function is used to convert the result of the division to an integer, effectively truncating any fractional part.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the integer value of the expression `A * C / 2`.

Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A and C are integers provided by the user input)**
