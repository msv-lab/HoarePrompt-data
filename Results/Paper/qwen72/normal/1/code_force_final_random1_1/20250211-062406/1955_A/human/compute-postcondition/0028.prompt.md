Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30, representing the number of yogurts to buy, the price per yogurt, and the promotional price for two yogurts, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
    if B * 2 < C:
        print(A * B)
    elif A % 2 == 0:
        print(int(A * C / 2))
    else:
        X = A // 2
        print(X * C + B)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers from the input, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, no changes are made to the variables. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and if `A` is even, no changes are made to the variables. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `A` is `a`, `B` is `b`, `C` is `c`. If `b * 2 < c`, no changes are made. If `b * 2 >= c` and `a` is even, no changes are made. If `b * 2 >= c` and `a` is odd, `X` is set to `a // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user input. If `B * 2 < C`, there are no changes to `A`, `B`, `C`, or `i`. Otherwise, if `A` is even, there are no changes to `A`, `B`, `C`, or `i`. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
