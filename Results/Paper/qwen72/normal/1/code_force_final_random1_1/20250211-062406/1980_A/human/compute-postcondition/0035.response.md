The only object in the loop head is the variable `prob` and the iterable `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still have elements remaining, and `prob` will be set to the next element in `a`.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty iterable with at least one element remaining, and `prob` is the next element of `a`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must still have at least one element remaining, and `prob` will be set to the next element in `a`.

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`, `a` is a non-empty iterable with at least one element remaining, `freq` is a list of 7 zeros except for the position `ord(prob) - ord('A')` which is incremented by 1, `missing` is the sum of the differences `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, `results` now includes the value of `missing` as its last element, `prob` is the next element of `a`. The value at the position `ord(prob) - ord('A')` in `freq` is incremented by 1.**
