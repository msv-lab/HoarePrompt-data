Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing the number of problems `n`, the number of rounds `m`, and a string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: For each test case, the function calculates the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') using a list `freq` of size 7. This is done by iterating over the string `a` and incrementing the corresponding index in `freq`.

3. **Missing Problems Calculation**: The function then calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by subtracting the frequency of each difficulty from `m` and taking the maximum of 0 and this difference. This ensures that if there are already enough problems of a certain difficulty, the difference will be 0. The total number of missing problems is the sum of these differences.

4. **Result Collection**: The result for each test case is appended to the `results` list, which is returned at the end of the function.

5. **Output**: The main script calls the function and prints the results, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
