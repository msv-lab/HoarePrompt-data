The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is typically used when the value is not needed, but for the loop to start, it should be initialized to 0 or not explicitly initialized as it will be managed by the `range` function.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is managed by the range function**
