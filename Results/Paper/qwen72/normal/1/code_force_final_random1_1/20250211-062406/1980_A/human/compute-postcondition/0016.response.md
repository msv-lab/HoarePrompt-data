Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`, `a` remains a non-empty iterable, `freq` is a list where each element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` for each `prob` in `a` is incremented by 1, and all other elements remain 0, `missing` is the sum of the differences `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, `results` now includes the value of `missing` as its last element.** 

Explanation:
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`.
- `a` remains a non-empty iterable.
- `freq` is a list where each element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` for each `prob` in `a` is incremented by 1, and all other elements remain 0.
- `missing` is calculated as the sum of the differences `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`.
- `results` now includes the value of `missing` as its last element.
