The only objects in the loop head are `prob` and `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the iterable `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` must be a non-empty iterable, and `prob` was the first element of `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still be a non-empty iterable, and `prob` will now be the next element in `a`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is managed by the `range` function, `n`, `m`, and `a` are the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`, `a` must be a non-empty iterable, `freq` is a list where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `prob` is the next element in `a`**
