The function `func` accepts no direct parameters but is expected to process a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), which represents the number of piles, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), which represent the initial number of stones in each pile. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each test case. However, the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of piles and a list of `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The function returns a result for each test case.**
