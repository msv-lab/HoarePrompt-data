Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` of positive integers, where each integer represents the number of stones in each pile. The function determines the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the following rules: If the first pile has more than one stone, Alice wins. Otherwise, the function checks if the differences between consecutive unique values in the sorted list of piles are all exactly 1. If this condition holds, the winner alternates starting from Alice. The function returns 'Alice' if Alice wins, and 'Bob' otherwise. **
