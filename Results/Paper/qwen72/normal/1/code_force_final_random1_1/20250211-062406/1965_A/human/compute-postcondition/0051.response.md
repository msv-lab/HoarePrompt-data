Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements.
- `test` is True.
- The difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j - 1]` in the list `lis` is greater than 1.
- `j` is an odd number.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Bob')
```

This statement simply prints the string 'Bob'. The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement because it does not reference any of those variables or conditions.

Output: **Bob**
