Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is a map object containing integers from the input.
   - `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, the program maintains these conditions.
   - If 1 is in `lis` and the length of `lis` is greater than 1:
     - `test` indicates whether no two consecutive elements in `lis` have a difference greater than 1.
     - The length of `lis` remains either odd or even as it was initially.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('Alice')`.

Given the conditions, the print statement `print('Alice')` will always execute and print the string `'Alice'`. The conditions described do not affect the execution of the print statement directly. They only describe the state of the variables and objects in the program.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Alice**
