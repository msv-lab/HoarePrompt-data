You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of arr is at least 1 and does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    if (arr[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns the string 'Alice'.
    #State: *`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is at least 1 and does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `A` is False. The first element of `arr` is 1.
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is at least 1 and does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `A` is either True or False depending on the final value of `i` (it toggles with each iteration); `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 2 elements, including 1; `i` is the last index of `set_` that was processed before the loop ended; `not_c` is False if there exists any two consecutive elements in `set_` such that their difference is greater than 1, otherwise `not_c` remains True.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: *`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is at least 1 and does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `A` is the opposite of its previous value (if it was True, now it is False, and vice versa); `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 2 elements, including 1; `i` is the last index of `set_` that was processed before the loop ended; `not_c` is True, indicating that there are no two consecutive elements in `set_` such that their difference is greater than 1. If `not_c` is False, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `arr` of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It returns 'Alice' in one case, and in another case, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string 'Alice'.

Case_2: The program returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
