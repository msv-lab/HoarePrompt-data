Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `1` is in `lis`, the length of `lis` is greater than 3, `j` is 3. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
