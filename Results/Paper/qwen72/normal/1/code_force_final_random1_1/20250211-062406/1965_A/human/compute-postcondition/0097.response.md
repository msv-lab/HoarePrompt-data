To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop head and the conditions:

### Given Loop Head:
```python
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current State:
- `t` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements
- If the difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j - 1]` in the list `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is False
- If `j` is odd, the index `j` remains odd
- If `j` is even, the index `j` remains even
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `test` remains True

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `j` and the length of the list `lis`.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `[1, len(lis) - 1]`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 1 (since it starts from 1 and increments by 1).
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2.
- The list `lis` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again (since `j` will be 2, and the loop condition is `j < len(lis)`).

### Updated State:
- `t` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 3 elements
- `j` is 2
- If the difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j - 1]` in the list `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is False
- If `j` is odd, the index `j` remains odd
- If `j` is even, the index `j` remains even
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `test` remains True

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 3 elements, `j` is 2, if the difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j - 1]` in the list `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is False, and if `j` is odd, the index `j` remains odd. If `j` is even, the index `j` remains even. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `test` remains True.**
