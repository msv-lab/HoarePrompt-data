Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`.
- `1` is in `lis`.
- The length of `lis` is greater than 1.
- No two consecutive elements in `lis` have a difference greater than 1.
- `test` is set to True.
- The length of `lis` is odd.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, it will always print the same string regardless of the values of those variables.

Output: **Alice**
