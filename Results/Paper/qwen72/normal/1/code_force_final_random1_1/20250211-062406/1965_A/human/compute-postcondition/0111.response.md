Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to the length of `lis` (exclusive). If the difference between any two consecutive elements in `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If no such pair is found, `test` remains True.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`:** These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **Loop Iteration:** The loop iterates over the indices of `lis` starting from 1 up to `len(lis) - 1`.
- **Condition Check:** For each iteration, the loop checks if the difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j - 1]` is greater than 1.
- **Action Based on Condition:**
  - If the condition is met and `j` is odd, "Bob" is printed.
  - If the condition is met and `j` is even, "Alice" is printed.
  - In both cases, `test` is set to False, and the loop breaks.
- **Final State of `test`:** If no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1, `test` remains True. If such a pair is found, `test` is set to False and the loop terminates early.
