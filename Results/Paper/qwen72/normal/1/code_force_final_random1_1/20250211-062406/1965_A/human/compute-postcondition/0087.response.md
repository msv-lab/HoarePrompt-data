To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the following elements:
- `j`: This is the loop variable that will take values starting from 1 up to (but not including) `len(lis)`.
- `len(lis)`: This is the length of the list `lis`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `len(lis)` must be greater than 1. This is because the range function `range(1, len(lis))` will generate a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to (but not including) `len(lis)`. If `len(lis)` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`
- `test` is True

We need to ensure that `len(lis)` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, and `test`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `t` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements
- `test` is True

State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements, `test` is True**
