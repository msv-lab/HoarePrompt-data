Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is at least 1 and does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `A` is False; `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr`, including 1; `not_c` is True.**

The code snippet sets the variable `not_c` to `True`. The initial state of the other variables (`arr`, `A`, and `set_`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `not_c` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.
