The code snippet `set_.sort()` sorts the list `set_` in ascending order. This operation modifies `set_` but does not affect the other variables. The initial conditions for `arr`, `A`, and the contents of `set_` remain unchanged except for the sorting of `set_`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is at least 1 and does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `A` is False; `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr`, including 1.**
