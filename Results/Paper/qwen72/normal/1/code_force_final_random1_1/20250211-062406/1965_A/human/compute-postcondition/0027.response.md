Output State: **The program returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.** 

Explanation: The value of `A` determines the outcome. Since `A` is the opposite of its previous value, if it was True before, it is now False, and vice versa. The program checks the current value of `A` and returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, and 'Bob' if `A` is False.
