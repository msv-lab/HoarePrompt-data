### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check (`if (arr[0] != 1)`):**
   - The program checks if the first element of the array `arr` is not equal to 1. If it is not, it immediately returns 'Alice'. This is based on the observation that if the smallest pile has more than one stone, Alice can always win by removing all stones from all piles in her first move.
   - This check is correct because if the smallest pile has more than one stone, Alice can always choose a `k` that empties all piles, ensuring she wins.

2. **Handling the Case When the Smallest Pile Has One Stone:**
   - If the smallest pile has exactly one stone, the program proceeds to further checks.
   - It creates a set of unique values from `arr`, sorts it, and iterates through the sorted set to check the differences between consecutive elements.
   - The variable `not_c` is used to track whether the differences between consecutive elements are all exactly 1. If any difference is greater than 1, `not_c` is set to `False`.

3. **Toggling the Winner:**
   - The variable `A` is toggled (`A = not A`) in each iteration of the loop. This is done to simulate the turns of the game. If the differences between consecutive elements are all exactly 1, the winner alternates starting from Alice.
   - After the loop, if `not_c` is still `True`, `A` is toggled one more time to account for the final state of the game.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - The function returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' otherwise. This correctly reflects the alternating nature of the game and the conditions under which Alice or Bob wins.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules. The initial check and the subsequent checks for the differences between consecutive elements are both logically sound and correctly handle the problem's constraints.
