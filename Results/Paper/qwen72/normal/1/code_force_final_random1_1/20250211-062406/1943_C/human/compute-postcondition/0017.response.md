Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u-2` contains the value `v-1`, the list at index `v-1` contains the value `u-1`, and the list at index `v` now contains the value `u`. `u` is decreased by 1, and `v` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `v` is decremented by 1, while the value of `u` was already decreased by 1 in the initial state. The structure of the `u2vs` list remains unchanged, and `n` is still greater than 1.
