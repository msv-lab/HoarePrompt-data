The code snippet `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` reads two integers from the user input, splits them, and assigns them to `u` and `v` respectively. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u-1` contains the value `v-1`, the list at index `v-1` contains the value `u-1`, and the list at index `v` now contains the value `u`.
- `u` is the first integer from user input minus 1
- `v` is the second integer from user input minus 1

After executing the code:
- `u` and `v` are reassigned to the new values read from the user input.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u-1` contains the value `v-1`, the list at index `v-1` contains the value `u-1`, and the list at index `v` now contains the value `u`. `u` and `v` are the new integers from user input.**
