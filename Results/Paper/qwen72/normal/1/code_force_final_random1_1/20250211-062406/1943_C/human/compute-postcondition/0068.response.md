The code appends the tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `i` is 5, and `c2` is not explicitly defined but is part of the existing tuples in `ops`. The value of `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`, and since `c2` is used similarly in the existing tuples, we can assume `c2` is also `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`.

Therefore, the new tuple being appended is `((len(path_ba) / 2) - 1, 5)`, which is already present in `ops`. However, appending it again means it will appear twice.

Output State: **`path_ba` has a length greater than 4, `i` is 5, `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`, `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, `((len(path_ba) / 2) - 1, 5)`, `(c2, 5)`, `((len(path_ba) / 2) - 1, 5)`, and `((len(path_ba) / 2) - 1, 5)`**.
