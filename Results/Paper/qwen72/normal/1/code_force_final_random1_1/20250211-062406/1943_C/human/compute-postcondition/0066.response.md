To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `path_ba` has a length greater than 4.
- `i` is 3.
- `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`.
- `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, `((len(path_ba) / 2) - 1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i`, `path_ba`, and `c1`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`.
   - `len(path_ba)` is greater than 4.

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `3 + 2 = 5`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.
   - Substituting the values:
     - `i` is 5.
     - `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`.
     - `len(path_ba) - c1` must be greater than 5 for the loop to execute again.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `i` is now 5.
   - `c1` remains `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`.
   - `len(path_ba) - c1` must be greater than 5.

### Final State:
State: **`path_ba` has a length greater than 4, `i` is 5, `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`, `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, `((len(path_ba) / 2) - 1, 5)`, and `(c2, 5)`**.
