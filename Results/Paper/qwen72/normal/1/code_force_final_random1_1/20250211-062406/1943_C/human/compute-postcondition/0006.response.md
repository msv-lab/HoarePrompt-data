The code snippet `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list located at index `u` in the list `u2vs`. Given that `u` is `u - 1` and `v` is `v - 1`, the actual indices used in the operation are one less than their original values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u-1` now contains the value `v-1`, `u` is `u - 1`, `v` is `v - 1`.**
