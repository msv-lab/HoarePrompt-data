Output State: **`path_ba` has a length greater than 0, `i` is 1, `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`, `ops` contains the tuple `(c1, i)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `c1` is calculated as `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The tuple `(c1, i)` is appended to the list `ops`.
- The lengths and values of `path_ba` and `i` remain unchanged.
- The list `ops` now includes the tuple `(c1, i)`.
