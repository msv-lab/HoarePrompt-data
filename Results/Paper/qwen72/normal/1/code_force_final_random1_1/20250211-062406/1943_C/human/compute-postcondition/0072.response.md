To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `path_ba` is a list representing the full path from vertex `b` back to the starting vertex `a` (or the root of the BFS tree).
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
  - `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`.
  - `i` is equal to `ci + 1`.
  - `n` is `-1`.
  - `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`, where `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even:
  - `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd `i` from 1 up to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`, where `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1` and `c2` is `len(path_ba) / 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Length of `path_ba`:**
   - Let's assume `path_ba` has a length of `L`.

2. **Case 1: Length of `path_ba` is Odd:**
   - `ci` is the middle index: `ci = L // 2`.
   - `i` is `ci + 1`.
   - `n` is `-1`.
   - `ops` is a list of tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`, where `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`.

   For example, if `path_ba = [a, b, c, d, e]`:
   - `L = 5` (odd).
   - `ci = 2`.
   - `c = path_ba[2] = c`.
   - `ops = [(c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 2)]`.

3. **Case 2: Length of `path_ba` is Even:**
   - `c1` is `(L / 2) - 1`.
   - `c2` is `L / 2`.
   - `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd `i` from 1 up to `L - c1 - 1`.

   For example, if `path_ba = [a, b, c, d, e, f]`:
   - `L = 6` (even).
   - `c1 = 2`.
   - `c2 = 3`.
   - `ops = [(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3)]`.

4. **Mapping and Printing:**
   - The `map` function applies the lambda function `lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'` to each tuple in `ops`.
   - The lambda function increments the first element of each tuple by 1 and formats it as a string.
   - The `sep='\n'` argument ensures that each formatted string is printed on a new line.

### Example Outputs:

#### Case 1: Length of `path_ba` is Odd
- If `path_ba = [a, b, c, d, e]`:
  - `ops = [(c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 2)]`.
  - The output will be:
    ```
    c + 1 0
    c + 1 1
    c + 1 2
    ```

#### Case 2: Length of `path_ba` is Even
- If `path_ba = [a, b, c, d, e, f]`:
  - `ops = [(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3)]`.
  - The output will be:
    ```
    c1 + 1 1
    c2 + 1 1
    c1 + 1 3
    c2 + 1 3
    ```

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the logic of the code, the output will be:

- If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
  Output: **c + 1 0\n c + 1 1\n ... \n c + 1 ci (where c is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba` and ci is the middle index of `path_ba`)**
- If the length of `path_ba` is even:
  Output: **c1 + 1 1\n c2 + 1 1\n ... \n c1 + 1 (L - c1 - 1)\n c2 + 1 (L - c1 - 1) (where c1 is (L / 2) - 1 and c2 is L / 2)**

This output format ensures that the values are correctly incremented and formatted as specified.
