To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `i`: This is the loop variable.
   - `len(path_ba)`: This is the length of the `path_ba` list.
   - `c1`: This is a variable that is derived from `c2`, which in turn is derived from the length of `path_ba`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if the range function generates at least one value for `i`.
   - The range function `range(start, stop, step)` will generate values as long as `start < stop`.

3. **Evaluate the Range Function:**
   - `start = 1`
   - `stop = len(path_ba) - c1`
   - `step = 2`

   For the loop to execute, the condition `1 < len(path_ba) - c1` must be true.

4. **Substitute the Values:**
   - `c2 = len(path_ba) / 2` (since `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`)
   - `c1 = c2 - 1 = (len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`

   Therefore, the condition becomes:
   - `1 < len(path_ba) - ((len(path_ba) / 2) - 1)`
   - Simplifying this:
     - `1 < len(path_ba) - (len(path_ba) / 2) + 1`
     - `1 < (len(path_ba) / 2) + 1`
     - `0 < len(path_ba) / 2`
     - `0 < len(path_ba)`

   Since `len(path_ba)` is the length of the list, it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `len(path_ba)` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` must start at 1.
   - `c1` must be calculated as `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `path_ba` must have a length greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`.

State: **`path_ba` has a length greater than 0, `i` is 1, `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`**
