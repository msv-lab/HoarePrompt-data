Output State: **No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The value of `n` is a specific integer. `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, where each list corresponds to a vertex in the tree. The subsequent inputs (n-1 lines) are still expected to contain pairs of integers representing edges between vertices.**
