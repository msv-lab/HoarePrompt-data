To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ops))` statement, we need to analyze the conditions and the construction of the `ops` list based on the initial state.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Path Length and Middle Index Calculation:**
   - `path_ba` is a list representing the path from vertex `b` back to the starting vertex `a`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
     - `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`.
     - `i` is `ci + 1`.
     - `n` is `-1`.
     - `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`, where `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even:
     - `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd `i` from 1 up to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`.
     - `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`.
     - `c2` is `len(path_ba) / 2`.

### Case 1: Length of `path_ba` is Odd
- Let's say the length of `path_ba` is `L` and `L` is odd.
- The middle index `ci` is `L // 2`.
- The number of tuples in `ops` will be `ci + 1` because it includes indices from `0` to `ci`.
- Therefore, the length of `ops` will be `ci + 1 = L // 2 + 1`.

### Case 2: Length of `path_ba` is Even
- Let's say the length of `path_ba` is `L` and `L` is even.
- `c1` is `(L / 2) - 1`.
- `c2` is `L / 2`.
- The number of tuples in `ops` will be the number of odd indices from 1 to `L - c1 - 1`.
- The number of odd indices from 1 to `L - c1 - 1` is `(L - c1 - 1) // 2`.
- Substituting `c1`:
  - `L - ((L / 2) - 1) - 1 = L - L/2 + 1 - 1 = L/2`.
- Therefore, the number of odd indices is `L/2 // 2 = L/4`.

### Conclusion:
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the length of `ops` is `L // 2 + 1`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even, the length of `ops` is `L // 4`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not provided, we can only express the output in terms of the length of `path_ba`.

Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is L // 2 + 1 if the length of path_ba is odd, or L // 4 if the length of path_ba is even)**
