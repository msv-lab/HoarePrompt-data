The code snippet `u2vs[v].append(u)` modifies the list `u2vs` by appending the value of `u` to the list located at index `v` in `u2vs`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u-1` contains the value `v-1`
- `u` is `u - 1`
- `v` is `v - 1`

After executing the code:
- The list at index `v` in `u2vs` now includes the value `u` (which is `u - 1`).

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u-1` contains the value `v-1`, and the list at index `v` now contains the value `u-1`
- `u` is `u - 1`
- `v` is `v - 1`

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u-1` contains the value `v-1`, and the list at index `v` now contains the value `u-1`, `u` is `u - 1`, `v` is `v - 1`.**
