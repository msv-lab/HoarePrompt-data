Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` remains greater than 1, and `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `i+1` in the tree. The values of `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input, each decremented by 1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `n` is still greater than 1, and the list `u2vs` will have been populated such that each sublist at index `i` contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i+1` in the tree. The variables `u` and `v` will hold the last pair of integers read from the input, each decremented by 1, reflecting the last edge processed by the loop.
