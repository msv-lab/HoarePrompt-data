Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from standard input (stdin), where the first input is an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, followed by `n - 1` lines, each containing two integers `u` and `v` representing an edge between vertices `u` and `v`. The function processes this input to determine the operations needed based on the path between two vertices in the tree. If the length of the path is odd, it calculates a set of operations involving the middle vertex of the path. If the length of the path is even, it calculates a set of operations involving two middle vertices of the path. The function returns `None` and does not modify the variables `u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `previous`, `_`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ci`, `i`, `n`, and `ops` except for the changes made to `ops` as described.**
