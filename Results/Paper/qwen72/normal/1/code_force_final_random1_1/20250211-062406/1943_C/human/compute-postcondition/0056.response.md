Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `path_ba` contains the full path from vertex `b` back to the starting vertex `a` (or the root of the BFS tree) and has an odd number of elements, `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, `i` is equal to `ci + 1`, `n` is `-1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`, where `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`, and all other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `previous`, `_`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.**
