Output State: **`path_ba` has a length greater than 0, `i` is 1, `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`, `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`**

Explanation: The code appends the tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `i` is 1 and `c2` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, it remains as `c2`. The initial state specifies that `ops` already contains the tuple `(c1, i)`, and now it also contains `(c2, i)`. The values of `path_ba`, `i`, and `c1` remain unchanged.
