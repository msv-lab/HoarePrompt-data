The code snippet updates the value of `n` by assigning it the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`. Let's break down the impact:

- `path_ba[-1]` refers to the last element in the list `path_ba`, which is `b`.
- `previous[path_ba[-1]]` means `previous[b]`, which is the previous vertex in the BFS path leading to vertex `b`.

Therefore, `n` is now assigned the value of `previous[b]`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is the value of `previous[b]`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `i+1` in the tree, `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input, each decremented by 1, `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function starting from vertex `a`, `previous` is the array of previous vertices returned by the `bfs` function, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function (not used), `b` is the result of the function `func_1` applied to the distance array `d`, `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.**
