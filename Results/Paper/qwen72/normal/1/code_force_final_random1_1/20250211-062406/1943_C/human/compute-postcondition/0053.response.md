Output State: **`path_ba` contains the full path from vertex `b` back to the starting vertex `a` (or the root of the BFS tree) and has at least one element, `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` (which is at least 0), `i` is 1, `n` is `-1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`, `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`, and all other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `previous`, `_`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.**
