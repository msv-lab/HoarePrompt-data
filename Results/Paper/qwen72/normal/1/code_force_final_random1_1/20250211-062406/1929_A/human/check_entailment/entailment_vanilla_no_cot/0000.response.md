Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given solution does not correctly solve the problem. The goal is to maximize the "beauty" of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The provided solution simply sorts the array and prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which does not account for the sum of differences between all consecutive elements.

To correctly solve this problem, you should sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. However, the optimal strategy involves alternating the largest and smallest remaining elements to maximize the differences. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for _ in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Calculate the maximum beauty
        max_beauty = 0
        for i in range(n // 2):
            max_beauty += a[n - 1 - i] - a[i]
        
        print(max_beauty * 2 if n % 2 == 0 else max_beauty * 2 - (a[n // 2] - a[n // 2 - 1]))

```

This solution correctly calculates the maximum beauty by alternating the largest and smallest elements, ensuring the sum of differences is maximized.
