Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `ntest` is equal to `t`.
- `itest` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: The list `a` is described as a sorted list of integers from the input. This means that the elements of `a` are in non-decreasing order.
2. **First Element (`a[0]`)**: Since `a` is sorted, `a[0]` is the smallest element in the list.
3. **Last Element (`a[len(a) - 1]`)**: Similarly, `a[len(a) - 1]` is the largest element in the list because it is the last element in the sorted list.
4. **Difference Calculation**: The expression `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] (where a[len(a) - 1] is the largest element in the sorted list `a` and a[0] is the smallest element in the sorted list `a`)**
