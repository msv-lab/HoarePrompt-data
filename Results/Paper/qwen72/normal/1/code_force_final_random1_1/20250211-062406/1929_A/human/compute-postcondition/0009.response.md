The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `a` but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `ntest` is equal to `t`, `itest` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `ntest` must be greater than 1.**
