The function `func` does not explicitly define parameters within its signature, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` and an array `a` of integers. The function processes each test case according to the given constraints and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and an array `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns a result for each test case.**
