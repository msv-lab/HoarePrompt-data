Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the maximum beauty of the array as specified in the problem statement. The program sorts the array and then calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is not the same as calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting. This leads to incorrect outputs for most test cases.

For instance, with the input:
```
3
2 1 3
```
The correct output should be 2, as the sorted array `[1, 2, 3]` has a beauty of `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`. However, the program will output `2 - 1 = 1`, which is incorrect.

The corrected approach, as suggested in the original assessment, involves sorting the array and then computing the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This ensures that the maximum beauty is correctly calculated.

Final: **False**
