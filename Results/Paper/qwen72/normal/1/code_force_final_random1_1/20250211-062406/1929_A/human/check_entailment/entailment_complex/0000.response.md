Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after potentially rearranging the elements. The key insight is that to maximize the beauty, the largest possible differences should be maximized, which occurs when the array is sorted in either ascending or descending order. However, the given program simply calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the same as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This is because sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty.

The current implementation:
```python
print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
```
only computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is not the correct approach to find the maximum beauty.

The correct approach would be:
```python
print(sum(a[i] - a[i-1] for i in range(1, len(a))))
```

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
