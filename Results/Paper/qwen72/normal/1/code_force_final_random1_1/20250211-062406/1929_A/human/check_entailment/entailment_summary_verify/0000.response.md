Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted array, which does not align with the problem's requirement to calculate the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. The correct approach, as suggested in the original assessment, involves sorting the array and then computing the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This ensures that the beauty of the array is maximized according to the problem's definition.

Therefore, the original assessment correctly identifies the flaw in the program and provides a corrected version of the code that adheres to the problem's requirements.

Final: **False**
