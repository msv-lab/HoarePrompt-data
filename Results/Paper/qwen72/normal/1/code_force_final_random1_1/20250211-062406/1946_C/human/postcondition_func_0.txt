The function `func_1` reads an integer from standard input (`sys.stdin`) and calls the `solve` function that many times. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function completes, the input from `sys.stdin` will have been consumed, and the `solve` function will have been executed the specified number of times.
