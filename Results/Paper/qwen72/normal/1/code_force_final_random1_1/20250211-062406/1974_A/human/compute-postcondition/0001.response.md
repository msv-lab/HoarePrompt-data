To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

- The variable `i` is the loop iterator, and it starts at 0 by default when using `range(a)`.
- The variable `a` determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute at least once, `a` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (this is not relevant to the loop execution).
- For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99 (these are also not relevant to the loop execution).
- `a` is an input integer.

For the loop to execute, `a` must be greater than 0. The value of `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
