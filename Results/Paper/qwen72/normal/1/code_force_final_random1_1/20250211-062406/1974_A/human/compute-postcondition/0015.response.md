To determine what will be printed by the `print(z)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, where \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
- `a` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `z` is initially set to \((y + 1) // 2\).

### Conditions:
- If `m < a`, then:
  - `z` is updated to \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - (15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4) + 15 - 1) // 15\).
  - `m` is updated to \(15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4\).
- Otherwise, `z` and `m` retain their original values.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Value of `z`:**
   - `z` is initially set to \((y + 1) // 2\). This means `z` is the integer division of \(y + 1\) by 2.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - We need to check if `m < a`.
   - Since `m` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume it is initialized to some value. If `m` is not defined, it is typically considered to be 0 (or some default value).

3. **Update `z` and `m` if Condition is True:**
   - If `m < a` is true, then:
     - `z` is updated to \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - (15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4) + 15 - 1) // 15\).
     - `m` is updated to \(15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4\).

4. **Final Value of `z`:**
   - If `m < a` is true, `z` will be the result of the complex formula.
   - If `m < a` is false, `z` will retain its initial value \((y + 1) // 2\).

### Conclusion:
- Without knowing the exact values of `x`, `y`, `a`, and `m`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `z`.
- However, we can describe the value of `z` based on the conditions provided.

### Output:
Output: **z (where z is either (y + 1) // 2 or (y + 1) // 2 + (x - (15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4) + 15 - 1) // 15, depending on whether m < a)**
