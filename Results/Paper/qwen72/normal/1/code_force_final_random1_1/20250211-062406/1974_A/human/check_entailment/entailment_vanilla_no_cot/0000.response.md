Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in the calculation of the number of screens required. Specifically, the variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`, which attempts to determine the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. However, this calculation is flawed because it does not correctly account for the space used by the 2x2 icons and the available space for 1x1 icons.

Additionally, the condition `if m < a:` is incorrect because `a` represents the number of test cases, not the number of 1x1 icons. The correct comparison should be against `x`, the number of 1x1 icons.

A corrected version of the logic would need to properly calculate the number of screens required to fit both types of icons, ensuring that the space used by 2x2 icons is correctly accounted for and that any remaining space is used efficiently for 1x1 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (y + 1) // 2
        # Calculate the remaining space on these screens
        remaining_space = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - y * 4
        # Calculate the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        additional_screens = (x - remaining_space + 14) // 15
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens
        print(total_screens)
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of screens is calculated correctly based on the given constraints.
