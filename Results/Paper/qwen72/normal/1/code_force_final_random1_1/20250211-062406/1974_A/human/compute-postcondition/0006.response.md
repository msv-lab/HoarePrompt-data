Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user (0 <= x, y <= 99), `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `z` is updated to `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`, `m` is `15 * z - y * 4`, and the current value of `m` is less than `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `z` is updated to `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`.
- The value of `m` is recalculated as `15 * z - y * 4` using the new value of `z`.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `m` is less than `a` still holds true.
