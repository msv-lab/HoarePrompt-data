Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user (0 <= x, y <= 99), `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, `m` is `15 * z - y * 4`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`.
- The value of `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, which means `z` is the integer division of `(y + 1)` by 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
