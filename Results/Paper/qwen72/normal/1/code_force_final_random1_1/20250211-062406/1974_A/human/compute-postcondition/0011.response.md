Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user (0 <= x, y <= 99), `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `z = (y + 1) // 2` reassigns the value of `z` to `(y + 1) // 2`. Since `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, the value of `z` is updated accordingly. All other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `z` while keeping the rest of the initial state intact.
