The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user (0 <= x, y <= 99)
- `a` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `z` is initially `(y + 1) // 2`
- If `m` (which is `15 * z - y * 4`) is less than `a`, then `z` is updated to `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` and `m` is updated to `15 * z - y * 4`, ensuring that the new value of `m` is still less than `a`. Otherwise, the values of `z` and `m` remain unchanged.

After executing the code snippet:
- `x` and `y` are now assigned the values provided by the user input.
- The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, and `z` remain unchanged.
- The value of `m` is not yet calculated or updated because the condition to update `z` and `m` has not been checked yet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user (0 <= x, y <= 99), `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`.**
