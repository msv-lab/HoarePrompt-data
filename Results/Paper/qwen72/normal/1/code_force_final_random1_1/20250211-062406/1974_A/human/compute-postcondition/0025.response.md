Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^4. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99) from the user. It then computes a value `z` based on `y` and potentially adjusts it based on a condition involving `x` and `y`. The final value of `z` is printed for each test case. After the function concludes, the program state includes the number of test cases processed (`a`), the final values of `x` and `y` from the last test case, and the printed results for each test case. **
