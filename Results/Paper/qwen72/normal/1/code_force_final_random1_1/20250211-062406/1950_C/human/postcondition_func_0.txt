The function reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) indicating the number of times it will process a time string. For each of these `t` times, it reads a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format. It converts each `s` to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation and prints the converted time. The function does not return any value; it only prints the converted times. After all iterations, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` iterations have been performed, and the converted times have been printed.
