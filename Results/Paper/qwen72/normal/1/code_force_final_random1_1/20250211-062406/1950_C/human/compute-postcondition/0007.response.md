Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is the input string provided by the user, which must be a positive integer.
- `h` is the first two characters of `s` as a string, and `h` is not equal to '00'.
- The integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(h, end='')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement will print the value of `h` without adding a newline at the end (due to `end=''`).
- `h` is the first two characters of the string `s`, which represents a positive integer.
- Since `h` is not equal to '00' and its integer value is less than or equal to 12, `h` must be a valid hour in a 12-hour clock format (e.g., '01', '02', ..., '12').

### Output:
Output: **h (where h is the first two characters of the input string s, representing a valid hour in a 12-hour clock format)**
