You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

    06:06 PM
    12:14 PM
    12:59 AM
    12:00 AM
    02:34 PM

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) indicating the number of times it will process a time string. For each of these `t` times, it reads a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format. It converts each `s` to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation and prints the converted time. The function does not return any value; it only prints the converted times. After all iterations, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` iterations have been performed, and the converted times have been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases. This is correctly handled using `int(input())`.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, the function reads a string `s` representing a time in 24-hour format. This is correctly done using `input()` inside the loop.

3. **Extract Hours and Minutes**: The function extracts the hours (`h`) from the first two characters of the string `s` using `s[:2]`. This is correct.

4. **Convert Hours to 12-Hour Format**:
   - If the hours are `00`, it prints `12` followed by the rest of the string. This is correct because `00` in 24-hour format corresponds to `12` in 12-hour format.
   - If the hours are between `01` and `12`, it prints the hours as they are. This is correct.
   - If the hours are between `13` and `23`, it subtracts 12 from the hours and prints the result. This is correct.

5. **Print Minutes and AM/PM**:
   - The function prints the minutes part of the string `s` using `s[2:]`.
   - It determines whether to print `AM` or `PM` based on whether the original hours (`int(h)`) are greater than or equal to 12. This is correct.

6. **Output Formatting**:
   - The function ensures that the output is formatted correctly with the hours, minutes, and AM/PM in the required format.

Given the above steps, the function correctly converts the 24-hour format time to the 12-hour format time for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
