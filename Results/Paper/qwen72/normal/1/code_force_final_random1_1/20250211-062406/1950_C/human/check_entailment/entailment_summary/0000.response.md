Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly processes the input as specified in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, converting the 24-hour format time to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. The logic for handling the conversion is as follows:

1. If the hour part (`h`) is '00', it prints '12' followed by the rest of the time and 'AM'.
2. If the hour part is between '01' and '12', it prints the hour part as is followed by the rest of the time and 'AM' or 'PM' depending on whether the hour is less than 12.
3. If the hour part is greater than '12', it subtracts 12 from the hour part, formats it to ensure it has two digits, and then prints the result followed by the rest of the time and 'PM'.

This logic correctly handles all edge cases, such as '00:00' and '12:00', and ensures that the output is in the correct 12-hour format with leading zeros preserved.

Based on the execution summary, the program performs the required operations and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
