Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` is an integer such that the number of iterations performed equals the initial value of `t`. For each iteration, `s` was a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", where `hh` is an integer from 00 to 23 and `mm` is an integer from 00 to 59, representing a valid time in 24-hour format. The loop converted each `s` to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation and printed it. The final state of `t` is 0, as the loop has completed all its iterations, and `s` and `h` are no longer relevant as they are redefined in each iteration.**

This means that after the loop completes, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop has run the number of times specified by the initial value of `t`. The variables `s` and `h` will have been used in each iteration but do not retain any specific value after the loop finishes, as they are redefined in each iteration. The loop's primary effect is to convert each input time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation and print it.
