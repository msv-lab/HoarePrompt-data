To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 1442.
- `s` is a new input string provided by the user, which must be a positive integer.
- `h` is the first two characters of `s` as a string.
  - If `h` is '00', the value of `h` remains '00'.
  - If `int(h)` is less than or equal to 12, the integer value of `h` is within the range 1 to 12.
  - If `int(h)` is greater than 12, the integer value of `h` is greater than 12.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Extracting Substring `s[2:]`:**
   - `s[2:]` extracts all characters from the string `s` starting from the third character (index 2) to the end of the string.
   - For example, if `s = "1430"`, then `s[2:]` would be `"30"`.

2. **Determining the Time Format:**
   - The expression `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]` selects either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `int(h)`.
   - If `int(h) >= 12`, it returns 'PM'.
   - If `int(h) < 12`, it returns 'AM'.

3. **Combining the Results:**
   - The `print` statement will output the substring `s[2:]` followed by either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `int(h)`.

### Final Output:
- The output will be the substring `s[2:]` followed by 'AM' if `int(h)` is less than 12, or 'PM' if `int(h)` is 12 or greater.

### Example Scenarios:
- If `s = "1430"`, then `h = "14"`, `int(h) = 14`, and `int(h) >= 12` is true, so the output will be `"30 PM"`.
- If `s = "0930"`, then `h = "09"`, `int(h) = 9`, and `int(h) < 12` is true, so the output will be `"30 AM"`.

### General Output:
Output: **s[2:] followed by 'AM' if int(h) < 12, or 'PM' if int(h) >= 12 (where s[2:] is the substring of s starting from the third character, and h is the first two characters of s)**

This format ensures that the output is clear and precise, reflecting the conditions and values described in the initial state.
