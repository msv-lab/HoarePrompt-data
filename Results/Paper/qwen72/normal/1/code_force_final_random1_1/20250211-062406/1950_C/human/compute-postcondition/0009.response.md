Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is the input string provided by the user, which must be a positive integer.
- `h` is the first two characters of `s` as a string.
- `h` is not equal to '00'.
- `int(h)` is greater than 12.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Extracting `h` from `s`:**
   - `h` is the first two characters of the string `s`.
   - Since `s` is a positive integer, `h` will be a substring of `s` representing the first two digits.

2. **Condition on `h`:**
   - `h` is not equal to '00'.
   - `int(h)` is greater than 12.

3. **Converting `h` to an integer:**
   - `int(h)` converts the string `h` to an integer.
   - Since `int(h)` is greater than 12, the value of `int(h)` will be an integer between 13 and 99 (inclusive).

4. **Subtracting 12 from `int(h)`:**
   - The expression `int(h) - 12` will result in an integer between 1 and 87 (inclusive).

5. **Formatting the output:**
   - The `print` statement uses the format `'0{}'` to prepend a '0' to the result of `int(h) - 12`.
   - The `end=''` parameter ensures that no newline is added after the printed string.

### Final Output:
- The `print` statement will output a string where '0' is prepended to the result of `int(h) - 12`.

### Example Calculation:
- If `s = "1530"`, then `h = "15"`.
- `int(h) = 15`.
- `int(h) - 12 = 3`.
- The output will be `'03'`.

### General Case:
- For any valid `s` where the first two characters form a number greater than 12, the output will be `'0'` followed by the result of `int(h) - 12`.

Output: **0[int(h) - 12] (where int(h) is the integer value of the first two characters of the input string s, and int(h) is greater than 12)**
