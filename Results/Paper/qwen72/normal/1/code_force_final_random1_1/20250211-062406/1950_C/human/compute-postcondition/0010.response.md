Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is the input string provided by the user, which must be a positive integer, `h` is the first two characters of `s` as a string, and `h` is not equal to '00'. If `int(h)` is less than or equal to 12, the integer value of `h` is within the range 1 to 12. Otherwise, `int(h)` is greater than 12.***
