Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop completes all iterations, `mp` will contain all the unique prefix XOR values encountered during the loop, with each value mapped to a list of indices where it occurs. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating the loop has run `n` times. The array `a` will be populated with integers from `data` starting from index `0` up to `n-1`. The array `pf` will store the cumulative XOR values of elements in `a` up to each index. The variable `idx` will be equal to `n`, as it was incremented by 1 for each iteration. All other variables (`t`, `q`, `data`, `results`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`mp` will contain all the unique prefix XOR values encountered during the loop, with each value mapped to a list of indices where it occurs, `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will be populated with integers from `data` starting from index `0` up to `n-1`, `pf` will store the cumulative XOR values of elements in `a` up to each index, `idx` will be equal to `n + 2`, `t`, `q` must be greater than 0, `data`, `r` is equal to `int(data[n + 1])`, `l` is equal to `int(data[n])`, `x` is equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices associated with the value `pf[r]` in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices associated with the value `pf[l - 1]` in `mp`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where the first element greater than or equal to `l` is found, `it2` is the index in `v2` where the last element less than `r` is found. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is non-negative, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, then `results` will contain one additional element 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` will contain one additional element 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`mp` will contain all the unique prefix XOR values encountered during the loop, with each value mapped to a list of indices where it occurs. `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will be populated with integers from `data` starting from index `0` up to `n-1`, `pf` will store the cumulative XOR values of elements in `a` up to each index, `idx` will be equal to `n + 5`, `t` must be greater than 0, `q` is now `q - 1`, `data`, `r` is equal to `int(data[n + 4])`, `l` is equal to `int(data[n + 2])`, `x` is equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices associated with the value `pf[r]` in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices associated with the value `pf[l - 1]` in `mp`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where the first element greater than or equal to `l` is found, `it2` is the index in `v2` where the last element less than `r` is found, `v2` is updated to the list of indices associated with the value `pf[l - 1]` in `mp`. If `x` is equal to 0, `results` now contains the string 'YES'. If `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`, `results` now also contains the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` now also contains the string 'NO'. `it2` is now `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `v1` is the list associated with the key `pf[r]` in the dictionary `mp`, and `v2` is the list associated with the key `pf[l - 1]` in the dictionary `mp` (or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`). `it1` is the index of the first element in `v1` that is greater than or equal to `l` using `bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)`, and `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `x` is equal to 0, `results` contains the string 'YES'. If `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`, `results` contains the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains the string 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
