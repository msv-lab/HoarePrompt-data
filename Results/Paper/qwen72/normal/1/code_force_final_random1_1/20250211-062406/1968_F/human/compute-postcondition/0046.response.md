Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the same as initially assigned, `q` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by `n + 4`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the corresponding integer value from `data` starting from `data[idx - n - 6]` to `data[idx - 5]`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where these `pf` values occur, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` is equal to 0, `results` now includes the string 'YES'. `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`. `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`. `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would fit in order to maintain the sorted order of `v1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)` uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the position in the sorted list `v1` where `l` would fit to maintain the sorted order.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
