Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - (n + 2) * q - 1]` and must be at least 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - (n + 2) * q - 2]` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + n + 3`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is `int(data[idx - (n + 2) * q - n + i - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is the cumulative XOR of elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the unique values in `pf` and their respective indices as values, `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), with the last element being 'YES' if `x` is 0, otherwise the last element remains an empty string, `i` is `n`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is 0 if the condition `x == 0` is true, otherwise `x` retains its original value, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`.**
