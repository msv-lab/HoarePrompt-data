Postcondition: ***`mp` will contain all the unique prefix XOR values encountered during the loop, with each value mapped to a list of indices where it occurs. `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will be populated with integers from `data` starting from index `0` up to `n-1`, `pf` will store the cumulative XOR values of elements in `a` up to each index, `idx` will be equal to `n + 5`, `t` must be greater than 0, `q` is now `q - 1`, `data`, `r` is equal to `int(data[n + 4])`, `l` is equal to `int(data[n + 2])`, `x` is equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices associated with the value `pf[r]` in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices associated with the value `pf[l - 1]` in `mp`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where the first element greater than or equal to `l` is found, `it2` is the index in `v2` where the last element less than `r` is found, `v2` is updated to the list of indices associated with the value `pf[l - 1]` in `mp`. If `x` is equal to 0, `results` now contains the string 'YES'. If `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`, `results` now also contains the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` now also contains the string 'NO'. `it2` is now `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.***
