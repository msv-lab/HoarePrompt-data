You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an if statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account the condition of the if statement. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after entering the if condition. So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is also true. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is less than 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` is integer of any value`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive less than 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m, a is alist of integers
if condition:
```
if n < 0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`,  if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m. a is a list of integers. the current value of  n is lower than 0***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is not 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: `it2` is the index in `v2` where `r` would fit in order to maintain the sorted order of `v2`, decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the same as initially assigned, `q` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by `n + 4`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the corresponding integer value from `data` starting from `data[idx - n - 6]` to `data[idx - 5]`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where these `pf` values occur, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` is equal to 0, `results` now includes the string 'YES'. `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`. `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`. `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would fit in order to maintain the sorted order of `v1`.
if condition:
```
if (it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition . All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the if condition must also be included. If the variables have values related to previous conditions try to put that early in the postcondition and say the current value of the variable from then on. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it enters the if condition.
In your response strictly use the format: Postcondition: **the postcondition you calculate.**, and describe this postcondition in Natural language easily understandable by humans
