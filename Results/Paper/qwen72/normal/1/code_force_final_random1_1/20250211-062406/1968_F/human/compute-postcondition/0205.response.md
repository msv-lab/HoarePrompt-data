Output State: **`mp` will contain all the unique prefix XOR values encountered during the loop, with each value mapped to a list of indices where it occurs, `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will be populated with integers from `data` starting from index `0` up to `n-1`, `pf` will store the cumulative XOR values of elements in `a` up to each index, `idx` will be equal to `n + 2`, `t`, `q` must be greater than 0, `data`, `results` may contain one additional element 'YES' if `x` is 0, `r` is equal to `int(data[n + 1])`, `l` is equal to `int(data[n])`, `x` is equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices associated with the value `pf[r]` in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices associated with the value `pf[l - 1]` in `mp`, `it1`, `it2` remain unchanged. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
