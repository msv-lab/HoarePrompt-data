To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be at least 0
- `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`
- `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + 3`
- `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`
- `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, with `pf[1]` being `int(data[idx - 1])`
- `mp` is a dictionary with either one key-value pair `{0: [0]}` or two key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1]}`
- `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), with the last element being an empty string
- `i` is 1
- `pf[1]` is `int(data[idx - 1])`

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `i` must still be less than `n + 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
- `n` remains the same, as it is determined by `data[idx - 3]` and does not change within the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be at least 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + 3`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, with `pf[1]` being `int(data[idx - 1])`, `mp` is a dictionary with either one key-value pair `{0: [0]}` or two key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1]}`, `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), with the last element being an empty string, `i` is 2, and `pf[1]` is `int(data[idx - 1])`**
