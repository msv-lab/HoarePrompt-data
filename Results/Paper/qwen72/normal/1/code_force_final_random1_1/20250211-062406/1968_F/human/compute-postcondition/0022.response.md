Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `q` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `idx` is increased by 4, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `a[1]` which is set to `int(data[idx - 2])` and `a[2]` which is set to `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{0: [0]}` and `mp[pf[1]]` now contains `[1]`, `i` is 2, `pf[1]` is `a[1]`.**

Explanation:
- `idx` was initially increased by 3, and now it is increased by 1 more, making the total increase 4.
- `q` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 2]` because `idx` has been increased by 4, so `idx - 2` refers to the original `idx + 2`.
- `a[1]` is set to `int(data[idx - 2])` and `a[2]` is set to `int(data[idx - 1])`, reflecting the updated `idx` value.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
