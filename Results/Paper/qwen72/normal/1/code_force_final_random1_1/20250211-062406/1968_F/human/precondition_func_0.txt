t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5; a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30; each query consists of two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
