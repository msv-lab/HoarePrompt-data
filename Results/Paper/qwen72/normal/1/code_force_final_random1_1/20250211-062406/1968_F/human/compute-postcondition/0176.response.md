Postcondition: **`mp` is updated to `{(0): [0]}`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a[1]` is set to `int(data[idx-1])`, `idx` is incremented by 1, `pf[1]` is set to `pf[0] ^ a[1]`, all other variables (`t`, `q`, `data`, `a`, `pf`, `results`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) remain unchanged, and `pf[1]` is not a key in the dictionary `mp`.**
