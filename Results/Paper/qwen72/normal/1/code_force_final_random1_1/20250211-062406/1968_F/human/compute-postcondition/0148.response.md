The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range `q`. The loop will execute one more time if the current value of `_` is less than `q-1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the only change needed for the loop to execute one more time is to increment `_` by 1, assuming it is within the bounds of the range `q`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment:

State: **All initial conditions remain unchanged, except that `v1` is now the value associated with the key `pf[r]` in the dictionary `mp`, or an empty list `[]` if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`. Additionally, `v2` is now the value associated with the key `pf[l - 1]` in the dictionary `mp`, or an empty list `[]` if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`. `it1` is the index of the first element in `v1` that is greater than or equal to `l`, or the length of `v1` if no such element exists. `it2` is the index just before the first element in `v2` that is greater than or equal to `r`, or -1 if no such element exists. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`, the `results` list now includes the string 'YES' as its last element. Otherwise, the `results` list has one additional element, which is the string 'NO'. `_` is incremented by 1.**
