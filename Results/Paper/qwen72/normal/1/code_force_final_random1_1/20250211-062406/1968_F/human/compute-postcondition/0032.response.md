Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 3, `q` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `idx` is increased by 5, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `a[1]` which is set to `int(data[idx - 3])`, `a[2]` which is set to `int(data[idx - 2])`, and `a[3]` which is set to `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1], pf[2]: [2]}`. If `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp` is updated to include `pf[i]` with an empty list as its value. `i` is 3, `pf[1]` is `a[1]`, `pf[2]` is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`.***
