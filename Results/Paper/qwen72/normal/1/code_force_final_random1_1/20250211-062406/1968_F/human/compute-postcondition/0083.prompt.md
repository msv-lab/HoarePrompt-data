Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the same as initially assigned, `q` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - (n + 1)]`, `idx` is increased by `n + 2`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the corresponding integer value from `data` starting from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx - 1]`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, and `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where these `pf` values occur.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `it2` is the index in `v2` where `r` would fit in order to maintain the sorted order of `v2`, decreased by 1. `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the same as initially assigned, `q` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by `n + 4`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the corresponding integer value from `data` starting from `data[idx - n - 6]` to `data[idx - 5]`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where these `pf` values occur, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` is equal to 0, `results` now includes the string 'YES'. `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`. `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`. `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would fit in order to maintain the sorted order of `v1`. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`, then `results` includes the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` includes both the strings 'YES' and 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`it2` is the index in `v2` where `r` would fit in order to maintain the sorted order of `v2`, decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged: `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would fit in order to maintain the sorted order of `v1`. `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`. `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`. `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the same as initially assigned, `idx` is increased by `n + 6`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the corresponding integer value from `data` starting from `data[idx - n - 8]` to `data[idx - 7]`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where these `pf` values occur, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` is equal to 0, `results` includes the string 'YES'. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`, then `results` includes the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` includes both the strings 'YES' and 'NO'. `q` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would fit in order to maintain the sorted order of `v1`, `it2` is the index in `v2` where `r` would fit in order to maintain the sorted order of `v2`, decreased by 1, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`, `v1` is now the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the same as initially assigned, `idx` is increased by `n + 8`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the corresponding integer value from `data` starting from `data[idx - n - 10]` to `data[idx - 8]`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where these `pf` values occur, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `q` is greater than 0. If `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`, `results` includes the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` includes the string 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
