Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + n + 3`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the unique values in `pf` and their respective indices as values, `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), with the last element being an empty string, `i` is `n`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index in `v2` just before the position where `r` would be inserted to maintain sorted order.**

Explanation:
- The line `pf = [0] * (n + 1)` initializes the list `pf` to a list of zeros of length `n + 1`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
