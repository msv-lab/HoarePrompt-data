You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient for handling large inputs as described in the problem constraints.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix XOR (`pf`) for the array `a`. The prefix XOR up to index `i` is stored in `pf[i]`. This allows for quick computation of the XOR of any subarray using the formula `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.

3. **Mapping Prefix XORs**: The program uses a dictionary `mp` to map each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this prefix XOR occurs. This helps in quickly finding if there are multiple segments with the same XOR value.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the program computes the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
   - If the XOR is zero, the subarray is trivially interesting because it can be split into segments with XOR zero.
   - If the XOR is non-zero, the program checks if there are indices `i` and `j` such that `l <= i <= r` and `l <= j <= r` and `pf[i] == pf[j]`. This is done using binary search (`bisect.bisect_left`) on the lists stored in `mp`.

5. **Output**: The results for each query are collected in a list `results` and printed at the end.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The prefix XOR calculation is correct and efficiently handles the computation of subarray XORs.
- **Mapping and Binary Search**: The use of a dictionary to map prefix XORs and binary search to find valid segments is appropriate and efficient.
- **Query Handling**: The logic for determining if a subarray is interesting is correct. It correctly identifies when the subarray can be split into segments with the same XOR value.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when the subarray XOR is zero and when there are no valid segments with the same XOR value.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
