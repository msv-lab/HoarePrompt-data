Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by 2, and `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros.
- The code snippet `pf = [0] * (n + 1)` creates a new list `pf` of length `n + 1`, initialized with zeros.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `idx`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The only new variable introduced is `pf`, which is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros.
