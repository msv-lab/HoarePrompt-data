To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, n + 1)`. For the loop to execute, the range must contain at least one value. This means that `n + 1` must be greater than 1, which implies that `n` must be at least 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (this is not directly relevant to the loop head).
- `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`.
- `q` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`.
- `idx` is increased by 2.
- `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros.
- `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros.
- `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{0: [0]}`.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The other variables (`i`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 1 as specified in the loop head.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{0: [0]}`, `i` is 1**
