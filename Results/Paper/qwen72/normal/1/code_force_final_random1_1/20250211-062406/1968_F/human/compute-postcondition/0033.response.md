Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 3, `q` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `idx` is increased by 5, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `a[1]` which is set to `int(data[idx - 3])`, `a[2]` which is set to `int(data[idx - 2])`, and `a[3]` which is set to `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1], pf[2]: [2], pf[3]: [3]}`, `i` is 3, `pf[1]` is `a[1]`, `pf[2]` is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list associated with the key `pf[3]` in the dictionary `mp`.
- Before the code execution, `mp` contained the keys `0`, `pf[1]`, and `pf[2]` with their respective lists `[0]`, `[1]`, and `[2]`.
- After the code execution, `mp` now includes the key `pf[3]` with the list `[3]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
