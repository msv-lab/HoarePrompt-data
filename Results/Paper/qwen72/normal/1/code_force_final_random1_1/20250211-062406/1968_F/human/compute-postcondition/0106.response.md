The code `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list associated with the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]` and must be at least 0
- `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`
- `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + 4`
- `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `a[1]` which is `int(data[idx - 3])` and `a[2]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`
- `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, with `pf[1]` being `int(data[idx - 3])` and `pf[2]` being `pf[1] ^ a[2]`
- `mp` is a dictionary with either one key-value pair `{0: [0]}` or two key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1]}`
- `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), with the last element being an empty string
- `i` is 2
- `pf[1]` is `int(data[idx - 3])`
- If `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[2]]` is an empty list

After executing the code:
- `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` will append the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list associated with the key `pf[2]` in the dictionary `mp`.

Since `i` is 2, `pf[2]` is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, and `pf[1]` is `int(data[idx - 3])`, the key `pf[2]` will be updated in `mp`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]` and must be at least 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + 4`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `a[1]` which is `int(data[idx - 3])` and `a[2]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, with `pf[1]` being `int(data[idx - 3])` and `pf[2]` being `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `mp` is a dictionary with either one key-value pair `{0: [0]}` or two key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1]}`, and now `mp[pf[2]]` contains `[2]`, `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), with the last element being an empty string, `i` is 2, `pf[1]` is `int(data[idx - 3])`.**
