Output State: **`mp` will contain all the unique prefix XOR values encountered during the loop, with each value mapped to a list of indices where it occurs, `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will be populated with integers from `data` starting from index `0` up to `n-1`, `pf` will store the cumulative XOR values of elements in `a` up to each index, `idx` will be equal to `n + 5`, `t` must be greater than 0, `q` is now `q - 1`, `data`, `r` is equal to `int(data[n + 4])`, `l` is equal to `int(data[n + 2])`, `x` is equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices associated with the value `pf[r]` in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices associated with the value `pf[l - 1]` in `mp`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where the first element greater than or equal to `l` is found, `it2` is the index in `v2` where the last element less than `r` is found, `v2` is updated to the list of indices associated with the value `pf[l - 1]` in `mp`. If `x` is equal to 0, `results` now contains the string 'YES' and the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation:
- The code `it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)` updates the variable `it1` to the index in `v1` where the first element greater than or equal to `l` is found.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
