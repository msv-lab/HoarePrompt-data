Output State: **`mp` is updated to `{(0): [0]}`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a[1]` is set to `int(data[idx])`, all other variables (`t`, `q`, `idx`, `a`, `pf`, `results`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i] = int(data[idx])` updates the list `a` at index `i` (which is 1) with the integer value of `data[idx]`.
- The initial state specifies that `mp` is `{(0): [0]}`, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0. These values remain unchanged.
- The value of `a[1]` is now `int(data[idx])`.
- All other variables mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged.
