The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop's ability to execute again depends on the value of `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used just to iterate a fixed number of times, it does not need to be explicitly tracked. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, but it will decrease by 1 as the loop progresses.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decreased by 1), `n` and `k` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by user input, `x` is a list of integers converted from user input.**
