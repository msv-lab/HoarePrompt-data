Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and the original value of `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]] - delta`, `a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of non-zero integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second, `n` is the number of monsters (equal to the length of `a` and `x`), `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from 0 to n-1 sorted based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, `rest` is `rest - delta`, the absolute value of the element at the index `sorted_indices[pos-1]` in `x` is not equal to `distance`, `pos` is `pos + 1`, and `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`**.
