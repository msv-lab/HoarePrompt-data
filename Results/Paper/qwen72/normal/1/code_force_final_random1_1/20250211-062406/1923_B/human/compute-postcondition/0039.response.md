Output State: **`a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is 0, `rest` remains `k - 2 * delta`, `pos` is the number of monsters that have been defeated (which is also the number of elements in `a` that are 0) plus 1, `distance` is now `distance + 1`, and `delta` is the minimum of the original `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`. The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged except for the modification to `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`.**
