Postcondition: ***`delta` is the minimum of the original `rest` and either `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` (depending on whether `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0). `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is decreased by `delta`, `rest` is now `k - 2 * delta - delta` and must be greater than 0, `pos` is the number of monsters that have been defeated and must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`, `distance` is now `distance + 1`, and the values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged except for the modifications to `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`.***
