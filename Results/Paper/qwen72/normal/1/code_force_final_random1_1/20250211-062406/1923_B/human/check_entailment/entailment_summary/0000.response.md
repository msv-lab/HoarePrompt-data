### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: `a` (health of monsters), `x` (positions of monsters), `k` (bullets per second).
   - **Behavior**:
     - Sorts the monsters by their absolute positions.
     - Iterates through the sorted list, attempting to reduce the health of monsters at each distance.
     - If a monster reaches position 0 (i.e., its absolute position equals the current distance), it returns `False`.
     - If all monsters are defeated before any monster reaches position 0, it returns `True`.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly processes the monsters in the order of their proximity to the player.
     - It ensures that no monster reaches the player by checking the distance and health of each monster.
     - The logic for reducing health and moving monsters is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: Multiple test cases.
   - **Behavior**:
     - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, reads `n` (number of monsters), `k` (bullets per second), `a` (health of monsters), and `x` (positions of monsters).
     - Calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns `True`, otherwise 'NO'.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the input and processes it according to the problem description.
     - The output format matches the required format (YES/NO).

### Conclusion:
Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. They handle the input and output as expected, and the logic for defeating the monsters and ensuring the player's survival is sound.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
