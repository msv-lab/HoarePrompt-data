The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `a` (a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster), `x` (a list of non-zero integers representing the initial positions of the monsters), and `k` (a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second). It processes the monsters in increasing order of their absolute positions. For each distance, it attempts to reduce the health of the monsters at that distance using up to `k` bullets. If at any point a monster reaches the position 0 (i.e., its absolute position equals the current distance), the function returns `False`. If all monsters are defeated before any monster reaches position 0, the function returns `True`. After the function concludes, the list `a` will contain the remaining health of each monster, with some elements possibly being 0 if those monsters have been defeated. The lists `x` and `k` remain unchanged.
