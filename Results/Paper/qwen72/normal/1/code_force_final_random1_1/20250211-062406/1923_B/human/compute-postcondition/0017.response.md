The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `k`, and two lists `a` and `x`.

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9.
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `x` is a list of `n` integers where -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. However, based on the constraints and the nature of the parameters, the function likely processes the lists `a` and `x` in some way, possibly involving the integers `t` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `k`, and two lists `a` and `x`. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints.**
