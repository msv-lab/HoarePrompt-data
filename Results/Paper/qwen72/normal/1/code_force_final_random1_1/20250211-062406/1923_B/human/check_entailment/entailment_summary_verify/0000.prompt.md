You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, x, k):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))
    distance = 0
    pos = 0
    while pos != len(sorted_indices):
        if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:
            return False
        rest = k
        while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
            delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
            rest -= delta
            a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
            if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
                pos += 1
        distance += 1
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads multiple sets of inputs from the user, each set consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, a list of integers `a`, and a list of integers `x`. For each set of inputs, it calls another function `func_1` with `a`, `x`, and `k` as arguments. If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all sets of inputs (determined by `t`), the function completes its execution. The final state of the program is that `t` is 0, and the last values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` are those from the last set of inputs processed.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Sorting by Distance**: The function `func_1` sorts the indices of the monsters based on their absolute distances from the player. This ensures that the closest monsters are handled first, which is crucial because the closest monsters pose the greatest threat.

2. **Handling Monsters**: The program iterates through the sorted indices and attempts to reduce the health of each monster using up to `k` bullets per second. It keeps track of the distance from the player and checks if any monster reaches the player's position (distance 0).

3. **Termination Conditions**:
   - If a monster reaches the player's position (`abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`), the function returns `False`, indicating that the player loses.
   - If all monsters are killed before any of them reach the player, the function returns `True`, indicating that the player wins.

4. **Input Handling**: The function `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the result using `func_1`.

The program handles edge cases such as:
- When `k` is large enough to kill all monsters in one second.
- When `k` is small and the player cannot kill all monsters before they reach the player.
- When the monsters are already very close to the player.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program seems to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
