Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of non-zero integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second, `n` is the number of monsters (equal to the length of `a` and `x`), `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from 0 to n-1 sorted based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, `pos` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while pos != len(sorted_indices):
    if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:
        return False
    rest = k
    while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
        delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
        rest -= delta
        a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
        if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
            pos += 1
    distance += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `a` will contain the remaining health of each monster, with some elements possibly being 0 if those monsters have been defeated. `rest` will be 0, indicating that no more bullets are left to fire. `pos` will be equal to the number of monsters that have been defeated, which is also the number of elements in `a` that are 0. The absolute value of the element at the index `sorted_indices[pos]` in `x` will still not be equal to `distance + 1`, assuming there are any monsters left with positive health. The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` will remain unchanged except for the modifications to `a` and `rest` as described. `distance` is now `distance + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` contains the remaining health of each monster, with some elements possibly being 0 if those monsters have been defeated. `rest` is equal to the number of bullets available, which is now equal to `k` (or less if all bullets have been used). `pos` is the number of monsters that have been defeated, which is also the number of elements in `a` that are 0, and `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`. The absolute value of the element at the index `sorted_indices[pos]` in `x` will still not be equal to `distance + 1`, assuming there are any monsters left with positive health. The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged except for the modifications to `a` and `rest` as described. `distance` is now `distance + 1`. If the absolute value of the element at the index `sorted_indices[pos]` in `x` is equal to `distance`, the program returns False.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The loop continues to execute until either `rest` becomes 0 or `pos` reaches the length of `sorted_indices`. At the end of the loop, `rest` will be 0 if there is enough health reduction to exhaust the remaining `rest` value. Otherwise, `pos` will be equal to the length of `sorted_indices`, indicating that all monsters have been defeated. The elements in `a` corresponding to the indices in `sorted_indices` up to `pos` will be reduced by their respective `delta` values, and any monster whose health reaches 0 will have its corresponding element in `a` set to 0. The value of `distance` will be incremented by 1. The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged except for the modifications to `a` and `rest` as described.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
