The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into separate strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0 (decreased by 1)
- `n` and `k` are integers provided by user input
- `a` is a list of integers provided by user input
- `x` is a list of integers converted from user input

After executing the code snippet, the variable `a` is updated to a new list of integers provided by the user input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decreased by 1), `n` and `k` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new user input, `x` is a list of integers converted from user input.**
