Postcondition: **`a` contains the remaining health of each monster, with the element at index `sorted_indices[pos]` reduced by `delta`. `rest` is now equal to `k - delta`. `pos` is the number of monsters that have been defeated, which is also the number of elements in `a` that are 0, and `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`. The absolute value of the element at the index `sorted_indices[pos]` in `x` will still not be equal to `distance + 1`, assuming there are any monsters left with positive health. The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged except for the modifications to `a` and `rest` as described. `distance` is now `distance + 1`. `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and the value at `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. Additionally, the element at index `sorted_indices[pos]` in `a` is 0.**
