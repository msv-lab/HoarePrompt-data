The function `func_2` reads multiple sets of inputs from the user, each set consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, a list of integers `a`, and a list of integers `x`. For each set of inputs, it calls another function `func_1` with `a`, `x`, and `k` as arguments. If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all sets of inputs (determined by `t`), the function completes its execution. The final state of the program is that `t` is 0, and the last values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` are those from the last set of inputs processed.
