Reasoning:  
The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function processes the monsters in increasing order of their absolute positions (`sorted_indices`).
   - It iterates through the monsters, attempting to reduce their health using up to `k` bullets per second.
   - If at any point a monster reaches the player's position (i.e., its absolute position equals the current distance), the function returns `False`.
   - If all monsters are defeated before any monster reaches the player's position, the function returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the inputs `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`.
   - It calls `func_1` with these inputs and prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns `True`, otherwise 'NO'.
   - The function correctly processes all test cases as specified in the problem statement.

3. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input handling in `func_2` is correct, reading the number of test cases and the inputs for each test case.
   - The output is correctly formatted as 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as when `k` is very large or when the number of monsters is small.
   - The sorting and iteration logic ensures that the closest monsters are processed first, which is crucial for the correctness of the solution.

Given the above points, the code appears to correctly implement the required logic and handle all specified constraints and edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
