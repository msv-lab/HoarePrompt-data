Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of the original `rest` and the value at `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`. `rest` is now `k - 3*delta`. The element at `sorted_indices[pos-1]` in `a` is reduced by `delta`. `distance` is incremented by 1. `pos` is incremented by 1. The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged. `rest` must be non-zero (i.e., `k` must be greater than `3*delta`), and `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`.**
