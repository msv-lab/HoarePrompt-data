The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case involves two integers, `a` and `b`, with the constraints 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and the total number of test cases, `t`, is constrained by 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

Given these constraints, the function likely processes each test case and returns a result for each pair `(a, b)`. Since the specific output is not provided, I'll assume the function returns some form of result for each test case, possibly related to the relationship or operation between `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9), and returns a result for each test case. The total number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**
