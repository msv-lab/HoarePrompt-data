Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `a` and `b` are even integers.

The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('yes')
```

This statement does not depend on the values of `i`, `a`, or `b`. It simply prints the string `'yes'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **yes**
