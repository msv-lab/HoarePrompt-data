Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the conditions used in the program do not accurately reflect the logic required to determine if a new rectangle can be formed. Here is a counterexample:

For the input `2 3`, the correct output should be "Yes" because the 2x3 rectangle can be cut into two 2x1 and 1x3 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 3x2 rectangle, which is considered the same as 2x3. However, the program outputs "No" for this input.

The program's logic is flawed, particularly in the conditions:
- `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` This condition is too restrictive and does not cover all valid cases.
- `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` This condition is incorrect and does not make logical sense.
- `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` This condition is also incorrect and does not accurately determine the possibility of forming a new rectangle.

A correct approach would involve checking if either dimension is greater than 1, as this would allow for a cut that results in a different rectangle configuration.
