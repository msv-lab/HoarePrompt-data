Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `a` and `b` are the integer values from the input. If both `a` and `b` are even, the condition `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0` holds. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd. The range defined by the user input must be greater than 1. If `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is true, then the respective condition holds. Otherwise, neither `(a - b == -a, a)` nor `(b - a == -b, b)` is true, and the difference `(a - b)` is either odd (not divisible by 2) or even (divisible by 2).***
