The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). It then evaluates specific conditions for each pair of integers and prints 'yes' or 'no' accordingly. The conditions are: if both `a` and `b` are even, it prints 'yes'; if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that all test cases have been evaluated and the corresponding results have been printed.
