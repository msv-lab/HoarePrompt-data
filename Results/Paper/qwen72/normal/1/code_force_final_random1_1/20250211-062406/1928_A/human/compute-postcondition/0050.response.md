To determine what will be printed by the `print('No')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `a` and `b` are input integers.
   - If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are set to `a // 2`.
   - If `b` is even, `b1` and `b2` are set to `b // 2`.
   - If `b` is even and `b1` is not equal to `a`, or if both `a` and `b` are odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
   - If `a1` is not equal to `b`, the program also continues to the next iteration of the loop.
   - If `b` is even and `b1` is equal to `a`, the program does not continue to the next iteration of the loop.

2. **Conditions for Execution:**
   - The `print('No')` statement will execute only if the program does not continue to the next iteration of the loop.
   - This means that the conditions for continuing to the next iteration must not be met.

3. **Analyzing the Conditions:**
   - For the program to not continue to the next iteration:
     - `b` must be even.
     - `b1` must be equal to `a`.
     - `a1` must be equal to `b`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - If the conditions are met (i.e., `b` is even, `b1` is equal to `a`, and `a1` is equal to `b`), the program will not continue to the next iteration, and the `print('No')` statement will execute.

Given the conditions, the `print('No')` statement will be executed, and it will print the string 'No'.

Output: **No**
