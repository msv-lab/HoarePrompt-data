The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from user input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This operation updates the values of `x` and `y` based on the new input, replacing their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is equal to `t` and greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `x` and `y` are updated to the new integers provided by the user input. If the new `y` > `x`, the condition `y` > `x` holds true. If the new `y` ≤ `x`, the condition `y` ≤ `x` holds true.**
