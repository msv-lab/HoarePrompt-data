Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `n` is equal to `t` and greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` remains a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int`. If the difference between the third and second elements of `l` is less than the difference between the second and first elements of `l`, then `d1[3]` is 2 and `d1[4]` is 3. Otherwise, `d1[3]` is `l[2] - l[1] + d1[2]` and `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`.***
