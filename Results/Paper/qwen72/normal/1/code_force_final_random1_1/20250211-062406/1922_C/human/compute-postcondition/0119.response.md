Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer (which must be greater than or equal to 2), `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and contains `{2: 1}`, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and is empty, `m` is the new input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by the user input. If `y` > `x`, the condition `y` > `x` holds true. If `y` ≤ `x`, the condition `y` ≤ `x` holds true.**
