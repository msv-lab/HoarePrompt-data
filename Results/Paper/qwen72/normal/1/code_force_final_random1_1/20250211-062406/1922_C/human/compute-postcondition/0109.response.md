To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
- `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1.
- `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1.
- `m` is a new input integer and must be greater than 2.
- `j` is 2.
- `x` and `y` are the new pair of integers provided by the user input.
- If `y` > `x`, the condition `y` > `x` holds true.
- If `y` ≤ `x`, the condition `y` ≤ `x` holds true.

### Analysis:
- `d1` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0 for any key that hasn't been explicitly set.
- The only explicitly set key in `d1` is `2`, with a value of 1 (`d1[2] = 1`).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Determine the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`**:
   - If `y` is 2, then `d1[y]` is 1.
   - If `y` is any other integer, then `d1[y]` is 0 (since `d1` defaults to 0 for any key not explicitly set).
   - If `x` is 2, then `d1[x]` is 1.
   - If `x` is any other integer, then `d1[x]` is 0.

2. **Calculate `d1[y] - d1[x]`**:
   - If both `y` and `x` are 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` is `1 - 1 = 0`.
   - If `y` is 2 and `x` is not 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` is `1 - 0 = 1`.
   - If `y` is not 2 and `x` is 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` is `0 - 1 = -1`.
   - If both `y` and `x` are not 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` is `0 - 0 = 0`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement depends on the values of `y` and `x`:
- If `y` is 2 and `x` is not 2, the output is 1.
- If `y` is not 2 and `x` is 2, the output is -1.
- If both `y` and `x` are 2, the output is 0.
- If both `y` and `x` are not 2, the output is 0.

Since the exact values of `y` and `x` are not provided, we can only describe the possible outputs based on the conditions.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] is 1 if y is 2, otherwise 0, and d1[x] is 1 if x is 2, otherwise 0)**
