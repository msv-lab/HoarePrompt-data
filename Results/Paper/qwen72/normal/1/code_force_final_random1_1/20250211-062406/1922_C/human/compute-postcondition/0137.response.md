Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `m` is the new input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a dictionary that will contain keys from 2 to `n` with values determined by the loop logic, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and now contains the key `n - 1` with the value 1. Additionally, the difference between the elements at indices `i` and `i - 1` in the list `l` is less than the difference between the elements at indices `i + 1` and `i`.**
