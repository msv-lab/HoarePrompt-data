Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the new input integer (which must be greater than or equal to 2), `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `m` is the new input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by the user input. If `y` > `x`, the condition `y` > `x` holds true. If `y` ≤ `x`, the condition `y` ≤ `x` holds true. The dictionary `d1` will contain keys from 2 to `n` with values determined by the loop logic: if `l[k + 1] - l[k] < l[k] - l[k - 1]` for each `k` from 1 to `n - 2`, then `d1[k + 2]` will be `1 + d1[k + 1]`. Otherwise, `d1[k + 2]` will be `l[k + 1] - l[k] + d1[k + 1]`. `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and now contains the key `n - 1` with the value 1.**
