Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, `tem` is `arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`**

Explanation:
- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `ans` still contains the last element of `arr`.
- `tem` is updated to be the product of the last element of `arr` (`arr[len(arr) - 1]`) and the second-to-last element of `arr` (`arr[len(arr) - 2]`).
- `i` remains `len(arr) - 2`.
