The function `func_8` accepts a list of positive integers `arr` and returns a new list `ans`. Each element in `ans` represents the cumulative product of the elements in `arr` up to the corresponding index. After the function concludes, `arr` remains unchanged, and `ans` contains the cumulative products.
