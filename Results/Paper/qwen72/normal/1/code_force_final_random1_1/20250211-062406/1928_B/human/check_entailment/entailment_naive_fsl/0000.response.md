Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided code does not implement the logic required to solve the problem described. The problem requires determining the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array. However, the provided functions do not address this requirement at all. They seem to be a collection of utility functions for reading input and performing basic operations, but none of them implement the core logic needed to solve the problem.

For example, the problem requires:
1. Reading multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, reading the array and determining the maximum frequency of any element after adding a permutation.
3. Outputting the result for each test case.

None of the provided functions (`func_1` to `func_9`) perform these steps. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
