Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index, and `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index. `sm` is -111.**
