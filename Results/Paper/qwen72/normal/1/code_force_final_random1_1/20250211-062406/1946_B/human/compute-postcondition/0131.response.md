Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index. If `suf[i + 1]` (which is `suf[3]`) is less than `smin[i]` (which is `smin[2]`), then `smin` is a list containing the elements [0, `suf[1]`, `suf[2]`, `suf[3]`]. Otherwise, `smin` is a list containing the elements [0, 0, `suf[2]`, `suf[2]`].***
