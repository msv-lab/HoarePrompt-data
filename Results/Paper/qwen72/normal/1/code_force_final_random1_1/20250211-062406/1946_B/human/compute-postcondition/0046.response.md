Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from a new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is a list containing the elements `[0, 0 + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`, `i` is `n`, `smin` is a list where each element at index `i` (from 0 to `n`) is the minimum value of the suffix sums from `suf[1]` to `suf[i+1]`, `sm` is `2 + suf[n]`, `a` is `abs(2 + suf[n]) // (10 ** 9 + 7)`, and the current value of `sm` is less than 0.**
