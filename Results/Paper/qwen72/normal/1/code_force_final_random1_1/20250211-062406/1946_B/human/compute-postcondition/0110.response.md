To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the loop head:

```python
for i in range(n):
```

In this loop head, the relevant variables are `i` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is the loop counter and is initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function. It will increment by 1 with each iteration.
2. **Variable `n`**: This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n` must be greater than 0**: This is a necessary condition for the loop to execute at least once.
- **`i` is 0**: This is the initial value of the loop counter, as determined by `range(n)`.

### Other Variables:
- **`t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, `smin`, `sm`, `a`**: These variables are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
Given the above analysis, the state that ensures the loop will execute is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
