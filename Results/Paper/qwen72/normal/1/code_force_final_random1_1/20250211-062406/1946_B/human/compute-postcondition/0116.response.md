Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is defined before the loop and is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n - 1`.
- **`suf`**: Initially, `suf` starts with a single element `[0]`. For each iteration of the loop, `suf` is updated by appending the sum of the current element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`. After `n` iterations, `suf` will contain `n + 1` elements, where each element represents the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index.

All other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, `smin`, `sm`, `a`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
