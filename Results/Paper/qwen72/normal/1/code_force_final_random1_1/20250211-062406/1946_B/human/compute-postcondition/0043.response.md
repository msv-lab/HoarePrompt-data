The given code snippet updates the value of `sm` using the formula `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm`. Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by whitespace.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b`.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from a new user input split by whitespace.
   - `suf` is a list containing the elements `[0, 0 + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `smin` is a list where each element at index `i` (from 0 to `n`) is the minimum value of the suffix sums from `suf[1]` to `suf[i+1]`.
   - `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`.

2. **Code Impact:**
   - The value of `sm` is updated to `2 ** k * sm - sm`.
   - Simplifying the expression: `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm` can be rewritten as `sm = (2 ** k - 1) * sm`.

3. **Updated State:**
   - All other variables remain unchanged.
   - `sm` is now `(2 ** k - 1) * sm`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from a new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is a list containing the elements `[0, 0 + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`, `i` is `n`, `smin` is a list where each element at index `i` (from 0 to `n`) is the minimum value of the suffix sums from `suf[1]` to `suf[i+1]`, `sm` is `(2 ** k - 1) * sm`.**
