The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `n + 1`, so we can only adjust these.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` should be 1.
- `n` must still be at least 0, ensuring that `n + 1` is at least 1, allowing the loop to execute when `i` is 1.

State: **`n` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index. If `suf[0] - smin[0]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is -111, then `sm` is updated to `suf[0] - smin[0]`. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.**
