The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `suf` is updated by appending `suf[1] + l[1]` to it.**
