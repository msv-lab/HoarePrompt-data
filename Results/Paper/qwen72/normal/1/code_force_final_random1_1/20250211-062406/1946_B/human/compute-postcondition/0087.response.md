The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `n + 1`, so we can only adjust these.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is the integer value of the first element in the new `b` and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n + 1` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` is 0 at the end of the last iteration, incrementing `i` by 1 gives us `i` as 1. Since `n` must be greater than 0, `n + 1` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the new `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the new `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is now a list containing `n + 1` elements starting with 0 and followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `i` is 1, `smin` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the minimum cumulative sum up to that index in `suf`. If `suf[0] - smin[0]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is -111, then `sm` is updated to `suf[0] - smin[0]`. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.**
