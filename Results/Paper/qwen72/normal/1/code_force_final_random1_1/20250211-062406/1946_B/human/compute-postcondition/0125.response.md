The code snippet `smin.append(suf[i + 1])` appends the value of `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index.
- If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` is a list containing the elements [0, `suf[1]`]. Otherwise, `smin` is a list containing the elements [0, 0].

After executing the code snippet:

- The value of `suf[i + 1]` (which is `suf[2]`) is appended to the list `smin`.
- The length of `smin` increases by 1.
- The new last element of `smin` is `suf[2]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` is a list containing the elements [0, `suf[1]`, `suf[2]`]. Otherwise, `smin` is a list containing the elements [0, 0, `suf[2]`].**
