Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from a new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is a list containing the elements [0, 0 + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]], `i` is n-1, and `smin` is a list where each element at index `i` (from 0 to n) is the minimum value of the suffix sums from `suf[1]` to `suf[i+1]`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `j` remains 0.
- The list `b` remains unchanged, containing the strings obtained from the user input split by whitespace.
- The variable `n` remains the integer value of the first element in `b`.
- The variable `k` remains the integer value of the second element in `b`.
- The list `l` remains unchanged, containing the integers obtained from a new user input split by whitespace.
- The list `suf` remains unchanged, containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l` starting from 0.
- The variable `i` is now equal to `n-1`, indicating the loop has completed its iterations.
- The list `smin` is updated such that each element at index `i` (from 0 to `n`) contains the minimum value of the suffix sums from `suf[1]` to `suf[i+1]`. This means `smin` will contain the minimum cumulative sum up to each position in the list `suf`.
