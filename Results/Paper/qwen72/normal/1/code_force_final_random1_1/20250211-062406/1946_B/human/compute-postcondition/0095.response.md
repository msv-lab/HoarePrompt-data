Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the new `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the new `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements starting with 0 and followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `i` is `n`, `smin` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the minimum cumulative sum up to that index in `suf`, `sm` is now `suf[n] + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `sm += suf[n]` updates the value of `sm` by adding the value of `suf[n]` to its current value, which was initially 2. Therefore, `sm` is now `suf[n] + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
