Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by whitespace, `n` must be at least 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from a new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is a list containing the elements [0, 0 + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]], `i` is 1, `smin` is a list where each element at index `i` (from 0 to n) is the minimum value of the suffix sums from `suf[1]` to `suf[i+1]`. If `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm == -111`, then `sm` is updated to `suf[1] - smin[1]`. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.***
