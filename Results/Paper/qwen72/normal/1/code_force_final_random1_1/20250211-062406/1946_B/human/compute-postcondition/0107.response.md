Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements starting with 0 and followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `i` is `n`, `smin` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the minimum cumulative sum up to that index in `suf`, `sm` is updated based on the conditions described, and `a` is set to 0 if `sm` was originally less than 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `l` with a new list of integers obtained from the user input split by whitespace.
- All other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `suf`, `i`, `smin`, `sm`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `l` is a list of integers derived from the new user input.
