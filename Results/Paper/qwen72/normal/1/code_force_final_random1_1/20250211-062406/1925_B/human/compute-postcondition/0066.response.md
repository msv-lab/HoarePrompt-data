Postcondition: ***`x` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `n` is updated to the value provided by the input, `q` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, and `t` remains unchanged. If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum value between the original `ans` and 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
