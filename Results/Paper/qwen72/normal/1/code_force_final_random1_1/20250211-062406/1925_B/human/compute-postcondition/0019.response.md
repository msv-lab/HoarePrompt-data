The code snippet `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8
- `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x
- `i` is 3
- `int(sqrt(x))` must be at least 3
- If `x % i == 0` and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)`, then `ans` is the maximum of its original value and `x // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

The impact of the code snippet is to update `ans` to the maximum of its current value and 3. Since `i` is 3, the new value of `ans` will be the maximum of its original value and 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 3, `int(sqrt(x))` must be at least 3, `ans` is the maximum of its original value and 3.**
