Postcondition: ***`x` must be at least 1, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, and `x` is divisible by `i` without any remainder. If `(x - n * i)` is non-negative and divisible by `i` without any remainder, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.***
