Postcondition: ***`x` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `n` is updated to the value provided by the input, `q` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, and `t` remains unchanged. If `x % i == 0` and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum value between the original `ans` and `x // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
