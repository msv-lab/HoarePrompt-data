Output State: **`x` must be at least 1, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, `ans` is the maximum of its original value and `x // i`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` remains at least 1.
- The value of `i` remains `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`.
- The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of its original value and the integer division of `x` by `i` (`x // i`). This means `ans` is now the larger of its previous value and `x // i`.
