Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `x` remains at least 1, `n` is updated to the value provided by the input, `q` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, and `t` remains unchanged. If `x % i == 0` and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // 3`. If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, then `ans` is further updated to the maximum of the current `ans` and 3. The loop will execute again if `3 < int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. If `x % i != 0`, `ans` remains unchanged and the loop will continue to check the condition for the next iteration.***
