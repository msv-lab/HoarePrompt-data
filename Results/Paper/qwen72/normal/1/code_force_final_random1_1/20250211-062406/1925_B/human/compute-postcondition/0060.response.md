Postcondition: **`x` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `n` is updated to the value provided by the input, `q` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, `ans` is 1, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`). Additionally, `(x - n * (x // i))` is non-negative and divisible by `(x // i)` (i.e., `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`), and `x // i` is greater than 0.**
