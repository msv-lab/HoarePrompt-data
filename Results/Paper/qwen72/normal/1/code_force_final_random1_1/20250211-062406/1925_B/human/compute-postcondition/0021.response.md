Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 3, `int(sqrt(x))` must be at least 3, `ans` is the maximum of its original value and `x // 3`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = max(ans, x // i)` updates the value of `ans` to the maximum of its current value and the result of `x // i`.
- Given that `i` is 3, the expression `x // i` simplifies to `x // 3`.
- The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of its original value and `x // 3`.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `int(sqrt(x))` must be at least 3 is still valid.
- The condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` does not affect the update of `ans` in this snippet.
