The code snippet `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Given that `i` is 2, `ans` will be updated to 2 if it was less than 2, or remain unchanged if it was already 2 or greater.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 2, `int(sqrt(x))` must be at least 2, and `ans` is the maximum of its original value and 2.**
