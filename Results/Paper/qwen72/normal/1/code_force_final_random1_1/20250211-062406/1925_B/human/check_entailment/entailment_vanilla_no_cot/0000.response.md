Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problem set that can be achieved by breaking down the problem of difficulty \(x\) into \(n\) sub-problems. The program iterates through potential divisors of \(x\) up to the square root of \(x\) to efficiently find the maximum GCD that satisfies the conditions. It checks both the divisor and its corresponding quotient to ensure all possible balances are considered. The logic and boundary conditions are handled appropriately, making the solution correct for the given problem description.
