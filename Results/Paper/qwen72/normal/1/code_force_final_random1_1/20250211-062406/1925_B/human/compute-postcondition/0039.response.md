The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Given that `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2` and `x` must be at least 1, the value of `i` is at least 3 (since the square root of 1 is 1, and adding 2 gives 3). Therefore, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its original value and 3 or more, depending on the value of `x`.

Output State: **`x` must be at least 1, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, `ans` is the maximum of its original value and `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`.**
