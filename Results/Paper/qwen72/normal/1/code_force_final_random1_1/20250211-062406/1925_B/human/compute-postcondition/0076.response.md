Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will have reached the value `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, `x` remains at least 1, `n` is updated to the value provided by the input, `q` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, and `t` remains unchanged. The variable `ans` will hold the maximum value among all divisors `i` (from 1 to `int(sqrt(x))`) that satisfy the conditions: `x % i == 0`, `x - n * i >= 0`, `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0`, `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, and `x // i > 0`. If no such divisor exists, `ans` will remain 1.**
