The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them by a space, and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. The previous values of `x` and `n` are overwritten by the new input values. The variable `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8 (new value from input), `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x (new value from input)**.
