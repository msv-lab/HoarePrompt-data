To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```
nx += xx[i][j - 1]
```

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24
- `j` is 3
- `nx` is determined by the same conditions as before (we don't know its exact value, but it is some integer)

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: It is 1.
2. **Variable `j`**: It is 3.
3. **Expression `j - 1`**: This evaluates to 2.
4. **Accessing `xx[i][j - 1]`**: This means accessing `xx[1][2]`. We don't know the exact value of `xx[1][2]` because `xx` is not defined in the initial state.
5. **Updating `nx`**: The value of `nx` is incremented by the value of `xx[1][2]`.

### Output State:
- `i` remains 1.
- `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.
- `j` remains 3.
- `nx` is now `nx + xx[1][2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3, `nx` is `nx + xx[1][2]`**.
