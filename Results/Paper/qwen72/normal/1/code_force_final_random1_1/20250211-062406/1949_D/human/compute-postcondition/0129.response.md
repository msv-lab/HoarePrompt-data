The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after executing this code, `nx` will contain the single character 'F'. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, `xx`, and `sa`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `nx` is 'F', `j` is 1, the character at position `[i][j - 1]` in `xx` is `?`, and either `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.**
