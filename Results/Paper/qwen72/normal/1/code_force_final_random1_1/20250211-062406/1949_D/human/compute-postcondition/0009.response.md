Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string with the character at index 0 being 'F', `j` is 1, and `a[1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[1]` by 1. Since `j` is 1, `a[1]` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `x`, and `j`) remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `a[1]` is incremented by 1, so after the code execution, this increment is reflected in the output state.
