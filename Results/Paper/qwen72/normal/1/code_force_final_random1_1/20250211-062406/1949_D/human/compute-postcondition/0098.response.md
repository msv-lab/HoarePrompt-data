Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the next `n` elements are the input strings corresponding to each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated based on the transitions in the input strings, `i` is 1, `sa` is either an empty list or a list containing `[1]` depending on whether `a[1]` is greater than 0 and `b[1]` is 0, and `sb` is a list containing the element 1 if `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0; otherwise, `sb` is an empty list.***
