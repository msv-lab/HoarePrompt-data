The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `nx`, we assume it is an empty string or already contains some characters. After appending 'F', the value of `nx` is updated accordingly. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3, and `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the character 'F'.**
