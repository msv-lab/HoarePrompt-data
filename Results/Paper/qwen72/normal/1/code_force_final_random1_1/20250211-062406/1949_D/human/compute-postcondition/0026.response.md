The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `b[1]` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `j` is 3, `b[1]` is incremented by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'F', then `a[1]` is incremented by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', then `b[1]` and `b[2]` are each incremented by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', then neither `a[1]` nor `b[1]` nor `b[2]` is incremented.**
