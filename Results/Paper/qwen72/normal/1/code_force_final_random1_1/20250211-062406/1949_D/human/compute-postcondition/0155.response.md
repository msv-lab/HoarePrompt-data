Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1, `nx` is 'F', and the character at position `[i][j - 1]` in `xx` is `?`. Additionally, either `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.**

Explanation:
- The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`.
- Initially, `nx` was an empty string, so after appending 'F', `nx` becomes 'F'.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`) and conditions remain unchanged.
