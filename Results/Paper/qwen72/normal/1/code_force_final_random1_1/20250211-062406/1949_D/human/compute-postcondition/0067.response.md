Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `x` is the new input string, `xx` is a list that now includes the new input string `x`, `j` is 1, and `xx` has one additional element which is the new input string `x`. The character at index `j - 1` (which is index 0) of `x` is not 'F'.***
