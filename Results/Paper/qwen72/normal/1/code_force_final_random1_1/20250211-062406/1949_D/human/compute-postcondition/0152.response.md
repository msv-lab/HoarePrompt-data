Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1, `nx` is the character at position 0 of the string `xx[2]`, and the character at position `j-1` (which is 0) of the string `xx[i]` is not '?'**. 

Explanation: The code appends the character at position `j-1` (which is 0) of the string `xx[i]` to the string `nx`. Since `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, the character at position 0 of `xx[2]` is added to `nx`. The other variables remain unchanged.
