Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2. If the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx` is not equal to '?', then `nx` is the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx`. If the character at position `[1][1]` in `xx` is '?', and if `1` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `2` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.***
