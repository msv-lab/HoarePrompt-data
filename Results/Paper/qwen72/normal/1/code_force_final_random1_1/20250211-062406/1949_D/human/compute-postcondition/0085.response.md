Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `x` is the new input string, `xx` is a list that includes the new input string `x` at least once, `j` is 3. If the character at index 2 (j-1) of `x` is 'S', then `b[3]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
