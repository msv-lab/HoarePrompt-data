The code snippet `sb.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `sb`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.
- `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the next `n` elements are the input strings corresponding to each iteration.
- `a` and `b` are updated based on the transitions in the input strings.
- `i` is 2.
- If `a[2] > 0` and `b[2] == 0`, `sa` is now a list containing `[1, 2]` if `a[1]` was greater than 0 and `b[1]` was 0, otherwise `sa` is now a list containing `[2]`.
- `sb` is a list containing the element 1 if `b[2]` is greater than 0 and `a[2]` is 0; otherwise, `sb` is an empty list.

After executing `sb.append(i)`:
- The value 2 is appended to the list `sb`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the next `n` elements are the input strings corresponding to each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated based on the transitions in the input strings, `i` is 2, if `a[2] > 0` and `b[2] == 0`, `sa` is now a list containing `[1, 2]` if `a[1]` was greater than 0 and `b[1]` was 0, otherwise `sa` is now a list containing `[2]`, `sb` is a list containing the element 1 if `b[2]` is greater than 0 and `a[2]` is 0; otherwise, `sb` is a list containing `[2]`.**
