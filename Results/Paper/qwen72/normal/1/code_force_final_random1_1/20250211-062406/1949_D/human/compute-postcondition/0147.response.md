To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic used to construct the string `nx`.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.
- `j` is `n + 1`.
- `nx` is a string constructed by appending characters from `xx[1][0]` to `xx[1][n-1]` based on specific conditions.

### Conditions for Constructing `nx`:
1. For each character in `xx[1][0]` to `xx[1][n-1]`:
   - If the character is not '?', it is appended to `nx`.
   - If the character is '?':
     - If `i` (which is 1) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, or if the current index `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`.
     - Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` starts at `n + 1` and decreases with each iteration of the loop.
   - `nx` starts as an empty string.

2. **Loop through `xx[1][0]` to `xx[1][n-1]`**:
   - For each character in `xx[1][0]` to `xx[1][n-1]`:
     - If the character is not '?', it is directly appended to `nx`.
     - If the character is '?':
       - Check if `i` (which is 1) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.
       - Check if the current index `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.
       - If either condition is true, append 'F' to `nx`.
       - Otherwise, append 'S' to `nx`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 8` and `xx[1] = "A?C?E?G?"` and `sa = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

- `i` is 1.
- `j` starts at 9 and decreases to 2.

1. **Character 'A'**:
   - Not '?', so append 'A' to `nx`.
   - `nx = "A"`

2. **Character '?'**:
   - `i` is 1, which is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` (0, 1, 2).
   - Append 'F' to `nx`.
   - `nx = "AF"`

3. **Character 'C'**:
   - Not '?', so append 'C' to `nx`.
   - `nx = "AFC"`

4. **Character '?'**:
   - `i` is 1, which is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` (0, 1, 2).
   - Append 'F' to `nx`.
   - `nx = "AFCF"`

5. **Character 'E'**:
   - Not '?', so append 'E' to `nx`.
   - `nx = "AFCFE"`

6. **Character '?'**:
   - `i` is 1, which is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` (0, 1, 2).
   - Append 'F' to `nx`.
   - `nx = "AFCFEF"`

7. **Character 'G'**:
   - Not '?', so append 'G' to `nx`.
   - `nx = "AFCFEFG"`

8. **Character '?'**:
   - `i` is 1, which is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` (0, 1, 2).
   - Append 'F' to `nx`.
   - `nx = "AFCFEFGF"`

### Final Output:
The final value of `nx` after constructing it based on the given conditions is "AFCFEFGF".

Output: **AFCFEFGF** (where `nx` is constructed based on the conditions described in the initial state)
