The value at index `j` (which is 1) of the list `b` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `x` is the new input string, `xx` is a list that now includes the new input string `x`, `j` is 1, the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', and the value at index 1 of `b` is incremented by 1.**
