Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the character 'S'.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. The new value of `nx` is the original value of `nx` concatenated with the character 'S'.
