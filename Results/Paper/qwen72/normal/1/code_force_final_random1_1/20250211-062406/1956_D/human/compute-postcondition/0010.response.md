Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, and all tuples in `ops` have been processed.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: This remains an integer read from input, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: This remains a list of integers read from input, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`s`, `m`, and `ops`**: These are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, and they are not modified within the loop.
- **`ops`**: All tuples in `ops` have been processed by the loop. The loop iterates over each tuple `(l, r)` in `ops` and prints `l + 1` and `r + 1`. After all iterations, there are no more tuples left to process in `ops`.

Thus, the final output state reflects that the loop has completed processing all tuples in `ops`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
