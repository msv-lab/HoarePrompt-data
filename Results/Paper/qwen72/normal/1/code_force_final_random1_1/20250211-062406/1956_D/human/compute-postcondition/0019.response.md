The function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` is called, which means the function will execute with the new parameters `pos + 1` and `r`. This call does not change the values of `l`, `r`, `a`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos` directly, but it initiates a recursive process that might affect these variables in subsequent calls.

However, since the function call itself does not modify the current state of the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the fact that the function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been called with the updated parameters.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq l \leq r < \text{len}(a)\), `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of elements in `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than \((r - l + 1) \times (r - l + 1)\), `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`, `pos` is not equal to `r`, `pos` is not equal to `l`, and `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called.**
