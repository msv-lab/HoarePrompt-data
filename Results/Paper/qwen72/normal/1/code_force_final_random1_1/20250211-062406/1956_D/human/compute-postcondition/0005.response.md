To determine what will be printed by the `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the context provided:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer read from input.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`.
- `ops` must be a non-empty list of tuples.

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `ops`**:
   - `ops` is a non-empty list of tuples. Each tuple in `ops` likely represents some operation or indices related to the list `a`.

2. **Identifying `l` and `r`**:
   - The `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement suggests that `l` and `r` are indices or values derived from the `ops` list.
   - Since `ops` is a list of tuples, it's reasonable to assume that `l` and `r` are the first and second elements of a tuple in `ops`.

3. **Determining the Values**:
   - Without the exact implementation of `func_2(a)`, we can infer that `l` and `r` are indices from the first tuple in `ops`.
   - For example, if `ops = [(0, 2), (1, 3)]`, then `l` would be 0 and `r` would be 2.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement will print the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`.
   - If `l` is 0 and `r` is 2, then `l + 1` is 1 and `r + 1` is 3.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the context, the `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement will print the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`, where `l` and `r` are the first and second elements of the first tuple in the `ops` list.

Output: **(l + 1, r + 1) (where l and r are the first and second elements of the first tuple in the ops list)**
