You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0
        return
    func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
    if a[l] != r - l + 1:

        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
        func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)

#Function 2:
def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []

    recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)
    return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)

#Function 3:
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
    else:
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if pos != l:
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        if pos != r:
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)

#Function 4:
def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the input, where each element is in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. It then calls another function `func_2` with `a` as an argument, which returns three values: `s` (the sum of the elements in `a`), `m` (the maximum value in `a`), and `ops` (a list of tuples). The function prints `s` and `m`, followed by each tuple in `ops` with each element incremented by 1. After the function completes, the input variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the output is the printed values of `s`, `m`, and the modified tuples in `ops`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has several issues that prevent it from being correct according to the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Function Call in `func_2`**:
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list, which is required by `func_1`. This will result in a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX calculation in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` is not correct. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, but the current implementation sets the value to `r - l + 1`, which is not necessarily the correct MEX.

3. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**:
   - The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` in `recursive_maximize_sum` is not a valid check for determining whether to apply the MEX operation. The correct approach would be to calculate the MEX and then update the subarray accordingly.

4. **Incorrect Base Case in `func_1`**:
   - The base case in `func_1` where `l == r` sets the element to 0 if it is not already 0. This is not always the correct MEX value for a single-element subarray.

To fix these issues, the program needs to correctly calculate the MEX for each subarray and apply the operations as described in the problem statement. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def mex(subarray):
    seen = set(subarray)
    mex_val = 0
    while mex_val in seen:
        mex_val += 1
    return mex_val

def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0
        return
    func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
    subarray = a[l:r+1]
    mex_val = mex(subarray)
    if a[l] != mex_val:
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = mex_val
        func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)

def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []
    recursive_maximize_sum(a, 0, n - 1, ops)
    return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)

def recursive_maximize_sum(a, l, r, ops):
    if l > r:
        return
    subarray = a[l:r+1]
    mex_val = mex(subarray)
    if a[l] != mex_val:
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = mex_val
    recursive_maximize_sum(a, l + 1, r, ops)

def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)

# Example usage
# func_3()
```

This corrected version ensures that the MEX is calculated correctly and the operations are applied as described in the problem statement.
