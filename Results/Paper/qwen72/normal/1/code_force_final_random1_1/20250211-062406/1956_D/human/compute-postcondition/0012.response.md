Functionality: ** The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the input, where each element is in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. It then calls another function `func_2` with `a` as an argument, which returns three values: `s` (the sum of the elements in `a`), `m` (the maximum value in `a`), and `ops` (a list of tuples). The function prints `s` and `m`, followed by each tuple in `ops` with each element incremented by 1. After the function completes, the input variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the output is the printed values of `s`, `m`, and the modified tuples in `ops`. **
