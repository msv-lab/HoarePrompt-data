### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of an array `a` by performing operations that set a subarray to its MEX. The operations must be performed no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) times.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function is designed to handle the base case where `l == r` and also to recursively process the subarray from `l+1` to `r`. If the current element `a[l]` is not equal to the length of the subarray (`r - l + 1`), it performs the operation and updates the array.
     - **Issue**: The function `func_1` incorrectly assumes that the MEX of the subarray `a[l:r]` is `r - l + 1`. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, which is not necessarily `r - l + 1`.
   - **func_2**: This function initializes the operations list and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array. It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.
   - **recursive_maximize_sum**: This function checks if the sum of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` is less than or equal to the square of its length. If so, it calls `func_1` to update the subarray. Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the left and right subarrays around this maximum element.
     - **Issue**: The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is not a correct criterion for determining whether to apply the MEX operation. The MEX operation should be applied based on the actual MEX value, not a comparison with the square of the subarray length.
   - **func_3**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the sum, the number of operations, and the operations.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Base Case Handling**: `func_1` correctly handles the base case where `l == r` and updates the array if necessary, but the MEX calculation is incorrect.
   - **Recursive Processing**: The recursive approach in `recursive_maximize_sum` is flawed because it uses an incorrect condition to decide whether to apply the MEX operation.
   - **Sum Maximization**: The logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` does not correctly maximize the sum of the array because it relies on an incorrect condition and an incorrect MEX calculation.
   - **Operation Count**: The operations are counted and stored in the `ops` list, but the operations themselves may not be valid due to the incorrect MEX calculation.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases correctly because the MEX calculation is incorrect. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3]`, the MEX is `0`, but the code might incorrectly set the subarray to `3`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array using the allowed operations. The functions `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` contain logical errors in the MEX calculation and the condition for applying the MEX operation.

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
