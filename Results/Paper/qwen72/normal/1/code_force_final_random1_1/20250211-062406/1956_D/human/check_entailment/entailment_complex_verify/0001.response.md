### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array by performing operations that set a subarray to the MEX of that subarray, with a limit of \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function handles the base case where `l == r` and updates the array if `a[l]` is not zero. For the general case, it recursively processes the subarray from `l+1` to `r` and updates the subarray if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`.
     - **Annotations**: The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function calls, ensuring that the function operates as intended.
   - **func_2**: This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array. It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.
     - **Annotations**: The annotations accurately describe the state of the program before and after the function call, ensuring that the function returns the correct results.
   - **recursive_maximize_sum**: This function checks if the sum of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` is less than or equal to the square of its length. If so, it calls `func_1` to update the subarray. Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the left and right subarrays around this maximum element.
     - **Annotations**: The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function calls, ensuring that the function processes the subarray correctly.
   - **func_3**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the sum, the number of operations, and the operations.
     - **Annotations**: The annotations accurately describe the state of the program before and after the function call, ensuring that the function reads the input and prints the correct results.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Base Case Handling**: `func_1` correctly handles the base case where `l == r` and updates the array if necessary.
   - **Recursive Processing**: `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` work together to ensure that the subarray is processed correctly, either by setting it to the MEX or by recursively processing smaller subarrays.
   - **Sum Maximization**: The logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` ensures that the sum of the array is maximized by either setting the subarray to the MEX or by recursively processing subarrays around the maximum element.
   - **Operation Count**: The operations are counted and stored in the `ops` list, ensuring that the number of operations does not exceed \(5 \times 10^5\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as when the array has only one element or when the array is already maximized.
   - The recursive approach ensures that all possible subarrays are considered, and the MEX is correctly calculated and applied.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array using the allowed operations. The functions are well-structured and handle all necessary cases.

Final: **True**
