The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of integers, where each integer is between 0 and \(10^7\). It returns a tuple containing three elements: the sum of all integers in the list `a`, the length of the list `ops`, and the list `ops` itself. The list `ops` is initially empty and may be modified by the `recursive_maximize_sum` function, which is called within `func_2`. After the function concludes, the sum of `a` is the total of all its elements, the length of `ops` is the number of elements in `ops`, and `ops` contains any elements that were added by the `recursive_maximize_sum` function.
