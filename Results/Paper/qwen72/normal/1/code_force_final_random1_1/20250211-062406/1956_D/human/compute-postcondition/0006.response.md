The only objects in the loop head are the variables `l` and `r` from the tuple `(l, r)` in the list `ops`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ops`. If there are more tuples in `ops`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `ops` must be a non-empty list of tuples, meaning it contains at least one tuple. For the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must contain at least two tuples. After the last iteration, the first tuple `(l, r)` has been processed, so the next tuple in the list will be the new `(l, r)`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must still be a non-empty list, and the next tuple in the list will be the new `(l, r)`.

State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, and `ops` must be a non-empty list of tuples, `(l, r)` is the next tuple in `ops`**
