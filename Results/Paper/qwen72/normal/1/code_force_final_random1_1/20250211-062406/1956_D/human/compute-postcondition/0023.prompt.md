You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), where a is a list of integers.
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if (s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)) :
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
            
        #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq l \leq r < \text{len}(a)\), `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of elements in `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, and the sum `s` is less than or equal to the square of the number of elements in the range from `l` to `r` inclusive, `ops` contains the tuple `(l, r)`, and all elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` inclusive are set to `r - l + 1`.
    else :
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if (pos != l) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        #State: `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq l \leq r < \text{len}(a)\), `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of elements in `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than \((r - l + 1) \times (r - l + 1)\), `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called.
        if (pos != r) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
        #State: *`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq l \leq r < \text{len}(a)\), `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of elements in `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than \((r - l + 1) \times (r - l + 1)\), `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called.
    #State: *`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq l \leq r < \text{len}(a)\), `a` is a list of integers, and `s` is the sum of elements in `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive. If `s` is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1) \times (r - l + 1)\), then `ops` contains the tuple `(l, r)`, and all elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` inclusive are set to `r - l + 1`. If `s` is greater than \((r - l + 1) \times (r - l + 1)\), then `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `l` and `r`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a). It returns the maximum sum that can be obtained from the subarray of the list `a` defined by the indices `l` and `r`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
