Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has several issues that prevent it from being correct according to the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Function Call in `func_2`**:
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list, which is required by `func_1`. This will result in a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX calculation in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` is not correct. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, but the current implementation sets the value to `r - l + 1`, which is not necessarily the correct MEX.

3. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**:
   - The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` in `recursive_maximize_sum` is not a valid check for determining whether to apply the MEX operation. The correct approach would be to calculate the MEX and then update the subarray accordingly.

4. **Incorrect Base Case in `func_1`**:
   - The base case in `func_1` where `l == r` sets the element to 0 if it is not already 0. This is not always the correct MEX value for a single-element subarray.

To fix these issues, the program needs to correctly calculate the MEX for each subarray and apply the operations as described in the problem statement. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def mex(subarray):
    seen = set(subarray)
    mex_val = 0
    while mex_val in seen:
        mex_val += 1
    return mex_val

def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0
        return
    func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
    subarray = a[l:r+1]
    mex_val = mex(subarray)
    if a[l] != mex_val:
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = mex_val
        func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)

def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []
    recursive_maximize_sum(a, 0, n - 1, ops)
    return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)

def recursive_maximize_sum(a, l, r, ops):
    if l > r:
        return
    subarray = a[l:r+1]
    mex_val = mex(subarray)
    if a[l] != mex_val:
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = mex_val
    recursive_maximize_sum(a, l + 1, r, ops)

def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)

# Example usage
# func_3()
```

This corrected version ensures that the MEX is calculated correctly and the operations are applied as described in the problem statement.
