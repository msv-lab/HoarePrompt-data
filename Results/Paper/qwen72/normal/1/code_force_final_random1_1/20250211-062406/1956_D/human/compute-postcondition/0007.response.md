To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer read from input.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by the function `func_2(a)`.
- `ops` is a non-empty list of tuples, where each tuple is of the form `(l, r)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(l + 1, r + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n`.

2. **Function Call:**
   - `func_2(a)` is called with the list `a` as an argument.
   - This function returns three values: `s`, `m`, and `ops`.
   - `ops` is a non-empty list of tuples, where each tuple is of the form `(l, r)`.

3. **Extracting Tuple:**
   - The next tuple `(l, r)` is extracted from the list `ops`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(l + 1, r + 1)` will print the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`.

### Explanation of Variables:
- `l` and `r` are the first and second elements of the next tuple in the list `ops`.
- Since `ops` is a non-empty list of tuples, there is at least one tuple `(l, r)` available.
- The values `l + 1` and `r + 1` are the indices `l` and `r` incremented by 1.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`, where `(l, r)` is the next tuple in the list `ops`.

Output: **l + 1, r + 1 (where l and r are the elements of the next tuple in the list ops)**
