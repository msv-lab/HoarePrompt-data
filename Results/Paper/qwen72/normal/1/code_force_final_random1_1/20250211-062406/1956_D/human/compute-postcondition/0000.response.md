Output State: **No variables are passed to the function `func_3`. Inside the function, `n` is an integer read from input, representing the length of the array `a`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet reads an integer value from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This value represents the length of the array `a` that will be read in the next steps. Since no other variables are mentioned or modified in the given code snippet, the rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
