To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range` function, starting from 0 by default.
2. The loop will execute if the value returned by `int(input())` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.

However, these variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`) are not directly involved in the loop head. The only variable that affects the loop's execution is the result of `int(input())`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, the input must be a positive integer.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
