Initial State: 
- `i` is 0.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers from the input.
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
- The value of `B * 2` is less than `C`.

Given the initial state, let's break down the values:

1. `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user.
2. The condition `B * 2 < C` must be satisfied.
3. The value of `A * B` is computed and printed.

Since the exact values of `A` and `B` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

The `print(A * B)` statement will print the product of `A` and `B`.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers provided by the user and B * 2 < C)**
