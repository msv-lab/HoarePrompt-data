To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers from the input.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 2.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `B * 2` is less than `C`, no further changes are made.
   - If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is even, no further changes are made.
   - If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(X * C + B)`.

Let's analyze the conditions:

- **Condition 1:** If `B * 2 < C`, then `X` is not set, and the print statement will raise a `NameError` because `X` is not defined.
- **Condition 2:** If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even, then `X` is not set, and the print statement will raise a `NameError` because `X` is not defined.
- **Condition 3:** If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd, then `X` is set to `A // 2`.

Given these conditions, the only scenario where `X` is defined is when `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd. In this case, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

Let's summarize the output:

- If `B * 2 < C` or if `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even, the print statement will raise a `NameError` because `X` is not defined.
- If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd, the print statement will output `X * C + B`, where `X = A // 2`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **X * C + B (where X is A // 2 if B * 2 >= C and A is odd, otherwise NameError)**
