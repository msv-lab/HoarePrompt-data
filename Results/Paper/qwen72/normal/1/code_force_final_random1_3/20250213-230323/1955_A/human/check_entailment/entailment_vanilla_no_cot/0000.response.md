Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The logic in the provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. The condition `if B * 2 < C:` checks if the price of two individual yogurts is less than the promotional price for two yogurts. However, this condition should be `if B * 2 <= C:` because even if the prices are equal, it's still better to use the individual price.

2. In the case where `A % 2 == 0`, the program correctly calculates the total cost using the promotional price for all yogurts. However, the formula `print(int(A * C / 2))` can be simplified to `print(A * C // 2)` to avoid potential floating-point issues.

3. In the case where `A % 2 != 0`, the program calculates the cost for the largest even number of yogurts using the promotional price and then adds the cost of one additional yogurt. This part is mostly correct, but the variable names and the structure can be improved for clarity.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a * 2 <= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            even_cost = (n // 2) * b
            odd_cost = (n % 2) * a
            print(even_cost + odd_cost)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- If the price of two individual yogurts is less than or equal to the promotional price, it uses the individual price for all yogurts.
- Otherwise, it calculates the cost for the largest even number of yogurts using the promotional price and adds the cost of any remaining yogurt(s).
