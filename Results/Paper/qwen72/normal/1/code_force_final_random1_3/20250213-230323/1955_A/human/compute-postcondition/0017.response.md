Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers from the input.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `B * 2` is less than `C`, no further changes are made.
   - If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is even, no further changes are made.
   - If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement to be printed is `X * C + B`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Check the Condition `B * 2 < C`:**
   - If this condition is true, no further changes are made, and `X` remains undefined. Since `X` is not defined, the print statement would raise an error. Therefore, this condition must be false for the print statement to execute without error.

2. **Check the Condition `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even:**
   - If both conditions are true, no further changes are made, and `X` remains undefined. Again, this would cause an error in the print statement. Therefore, this condition must also be false for the print statement to execute without error.

3. **Check the Condition `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd:**
   - If both conditions are true, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

Given that the print statement executes without error, the only valid scenario is when `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd. In this case, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

### Final Calculation:
- `X = A // 2`
- The print statement will output `X * C + B`.

### Output:
Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A, B, and C are the input integers, and A is odd)**
