Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. This aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The first condition checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is cheaper than the promotional price (`C`). If true, it prints the total cost as `A * B`, which is correct because it's cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price.
   - The second condition checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even. If true, it prints the total cost as `int(A * C / 2)`, which is correct because it means Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price.
   - The third condition handles the case where `A` is odd. It calculates the cost for the maximum number of pairs (`X = A // 2`) and adds the cost of one additional yogurt at the regular price (`B`). This is also correct.

3. **Output**: The program prints the correct minimum cost for each test case based on the conditions described.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to handle all the specified cases correctly and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
