Postcondition: **`t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` remains an input integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_j` has been modified according to the loop operations, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `numTest` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n-3]`, `a[n-3]` is now `a[n-3] - a[n-3]`, `a[n-2]` is now `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[n-1]` is now `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`. Additionally, either the last element of `a` (`a[len(a) - 1]`) is not 0, or the second-to-last element of `a` (`a[len(a) - 2]`) is not 0.**
