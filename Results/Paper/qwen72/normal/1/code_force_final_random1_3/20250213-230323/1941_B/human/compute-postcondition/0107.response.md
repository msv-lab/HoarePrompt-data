Let's break down the initial state and the operations performed to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `numTest` is incremented by 1.
- `stop` is `False`.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- The last element of `a` is no longer necessarily 0.
- The second-to-last element of `a` is no longer necessarily 0.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `opNum` is equal to `a[1]`.

### Operations:
1. `a[0]` is now `a[0] - a[1]`.
2. `a[1]` is now `a[1] - 2 * a[1]`.
3. `a[2]` is now `a[2] - a[1]`.
4. `a[1]` is now `a[1] - opNum`.
5. `a[2]` is now `a[2] - 2 * opNum`.
6. `a[3]` is now `a[3] - opNum`.

### Check Condition:
- If `a[1]` is less than 0, `numTest` is incremented by 1 again, `stop` is set to `True`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Print Statement:
```
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement `print('NO')` does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state or the operations. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The code will print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
