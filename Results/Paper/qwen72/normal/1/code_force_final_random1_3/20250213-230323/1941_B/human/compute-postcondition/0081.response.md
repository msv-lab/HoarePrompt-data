Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop has executed all its iterations, if `stop` is `True`, the state remains unchanged.
- The last element of `a` is 0.
- The second-to-last element of `a` is 0.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement does not depend on any variables or conditions from the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
