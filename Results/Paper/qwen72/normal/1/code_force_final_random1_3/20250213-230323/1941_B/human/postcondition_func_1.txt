The function `func_2` takes a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` (where 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) representing the length of the list. It modifies the list in place such that after the function completes, the first two elements of the list are set to 0, and all subsequent elements are either 0 or 1, with no two consecutive elements being both 1. The function then calls another function `func_1` with the modified list and `n`. If `func_1` returns `True`, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
