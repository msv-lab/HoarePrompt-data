You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and an array `b` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the first element of `b` is odd and the second element is not exactly two more than the first, or if the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not exactly two more than the last. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program reflects the results of these checks for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Operation**: The operation allows us to decrease `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively. This means that the total sum of the array decreases by 4 with each operation.

2. **Sum Condition**: For the entire array to become zero, the sum of the array must be divisible by 4. This is because each operation reduces the sum by 4.

3. **Edge Cases**: The first and last elements of the array cannot be part of the operation since they do not have both neighbors. Therefore, we need to check if these elements can be reduced to zero independently.

4. **Parity Check**: The parity (odd or even) of the first and last elements is crucial. If the first element is odd, it must be paired with an even element to the right to be reduced to zero. Similarly, if the last element is odd, it must be paired with an even element to the left.

5. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It checks if the first element is odd and not equal to the second element plus 2, or if the last element is odd and not equal to the second-to-last element plus 2.
   - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

6. **Flaws in the Program**:
   - The program only checks the first and last elements for specific conditions but does not consider the overall sum of the array.
   - The conditions checked are not sufficient to ensure that the entire array can be reduced to zero. For example, the program might incorrectly print 'YES' for an array where the sum is not divisible by 4.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not fully account for the necessary conditions to determine if the array can be reduced to zero.
