Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the print statement).
- `a` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- The first element of `b` is even or the second element of `b` is equal to the first element plus 2.
- The last element of `b` is even or the second-to-last element of `b` is equal to the last element plus 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The conditions described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement, as it does not depend on any variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
