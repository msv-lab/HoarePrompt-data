Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem by always adding the maximum value among the first \( n-1 \) books and the last book's page count. However, this approach does not always yield the correct result. The problem requires finding the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two non-empty piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages in each pile. The current implementation assumes that the last book should always be in one of the piles, which is not necessarily true.

For example, consider the test case:
```
4
2 3 3 1
```
The correct solution would be to divide the books such that the piles are [2, 3] and [3, 1], resulting in Alice reading the books with 3 pages from both piles, giving a total of 6 pages. However, the program will output 4, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
