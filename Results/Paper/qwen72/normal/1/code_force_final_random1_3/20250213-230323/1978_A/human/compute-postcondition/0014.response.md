The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters within the function signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of books for each test case.
- `a`: A list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the number of pages in each book.

Given these parameters, the function processes the input and produces an output. The exact output is not specified, but typically, such a function would return some result based on the number of pages in the books across the test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer representing the number of books in each test case), and `a` (a list of integers representing the number of pages in each book). The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the number of pages in the books across the test cases.**
