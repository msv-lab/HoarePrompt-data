The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. At the end of the last iteration, `_` has just completed one iteration, and `t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must increment by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the current value of `_`.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `_` is a throwaway variable that will iterate `t` times, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`**
