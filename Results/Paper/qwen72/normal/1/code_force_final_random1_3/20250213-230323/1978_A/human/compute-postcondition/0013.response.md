Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `_` has iterated `t` times, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, and the loop has completed all its iterations.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains the same as the initial input, which is an integer within the range 1 to 500.
- The variable `n` is still an input integer, and it has been used to define the length of the list `nums` in each iteration.
- The list `a` (which is not directly modified in the loop) remains a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9.
- The throwaway variable `_` has completed all `t` iterations.
- The list `nums` has been updated with new inputs in each iteration, but the final state of `nums` is the last list of integers provided by the user.
- The loop has finished executing, meaning that the value of `_` has reached `t`.
