To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 1.
- The function `func_1` is called with `b` and `1000000007` as arguments, and it returns two values, which are assigned to `c` and `d`.

Since the implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we can state that `c` and `d` will be the results of the function call.

The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged unless they are modified within `func_1`, but since their modification is not specified, we assume they remain the same.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, 1000000007)`.**
