You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers where b >= 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the tuple (1, 0)
    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0.
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns the values of `d` and `c`, which are the results of the function `func_1(b, a)` where `b` is an integer greater than 0 and `a` is an integer less than `b`.
    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0, and a is greater than or equal to b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns a tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)), where `a` is an integer greater than or equal to `b`, `b` is a positive integer, and `a` is divisible by `b`. The second element of the tuple is calculated as the negative of the quotient of `a` divided by `b` minus 1.
    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0, and a is greater than or equal to b, and a % b is not equal to 0
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)` where `d` is the second result from `func_1(b, a % b)` and `c - a // b * d` is calculated using the first result `c` from `func_1(b, a % b)`, the integer division of `a` by `b` (`a // b`), and `d`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where `b` is a non-negative integer. It returns different tuples based on the relationship between `a` and `b`: (1, 0) if `b` is 0; the results of `func_1(b, a)` if `b` > 0 and `a` < `b`; (1, -(a // b - 1)) if `a` ≥ `b` and `a` is divisible by `b`; or (d, c - a // b * d) if `a` ≥ `b` and `a` is not divisible by `b`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the tuple (1, 0)

Case_2: The program returns the values of `d` and `c`, which are the results of the function `func_1(b, a)` where `b` is an integer greater than 0 and `a` is an integer less than `b`.

Case_3: The program returns a tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)), where `a` is an integer greater than or equal to `b`, `b` is a positive integer, and `a` is divisible by `b`. The second element of the tuple is calculated as the negative of the quotient of `a` divided by `b` minus 1.

Case_4: The program returns a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)` where `d` is the second result from `func_1(b, a % b)` and `c - a // b * d` is calculated using the first result `c` from `func_1(b, a % b)`, the integer division of `a` by `b` (`a // b`), and `d`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
