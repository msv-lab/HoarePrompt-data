        #The program returns the values of `d` and `c`, which are the results of the function `func_1(b, a)` where `b` is an integer greater than 0 and `a` is an integer less than `b`.
    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0, and a is greater than or equal to b
    if (a % b == 0) :

        #The program returns a tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)), where `a` is an integer greater than or equal to `b`, `b` is a positive integer, and `a` is divisible by `b`. The second element of the tuple is calculated as the negative of the quotient of `a` divided by `b` minus 1.
    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0, and a is greater than or equal to b, and a % b is not equal to 0
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)` where `d` is the second result from `func_1(b, a % b)` and `c - a // b * d` is calculated using the first result `c` from `func_1(b, a % b)`, the integer division of `a` by `b` (`a // b`), and `d`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, where `b` is non-negative. It returns a tuple based on the following conditions:
- If `b` is 0, it returns the tuple (1, 0).
- If `a` is less than `b`, it returns the tuple (d, c), where `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a)`.
- If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `a` is divisible by `b`, it returns the tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)).
- If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `a` is not divisible by `b`, it returns the tuple (d, c - a // b * d), where `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer, b is a list of integers, and the length of b is at least 1.
def func_2(a, b):
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the result of (c * a) % 1000000007, where `c` is the first result from the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)` and `a` is an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `a` and a list of integers `b`. It computes the product of `a` and the first value returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, then returns the result modulo 1000000007. The function does not modify the input parameters `a` or `b`.
