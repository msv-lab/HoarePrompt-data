### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires us to determine the number of permutations of length \( n \) that have specific indices as their prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the GCD of two numbers and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.
     - If \(b = 0\), it returns \((1, 0)\).
     - If \(a < b\), it swaps \(a\) and \(b\) and calls itself recursively.
     - If \(a \% b = 0\), it returns \((1, -(a // b - 1))\).
     - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with \(b\) and \(a \% b\) and adjusts the results.
   - **func_2(a, b)**: This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of \(a\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - It calls `func_1(b, 1000000007)` to get the coefficients.
     - It returns \(c \times a \mod 1000000007\).

3. **Evaluating the Main Logic**:
   - The main part of the program initializes a list `facts` to store factorials up to \(200001\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - For each test case, it reads the input values \(n\), \(m1\), and \(m2\), and the lists of prefix and suffix maximum indices.
   - It checks if the last prefix maximum index is the same as the first suffix maximum index, and if the first prefix maximum index is 1 and the last suffix maximum index is \(n\). If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0.
   - If the conditions are met, it calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods and modular arithmetic.
   - It uses the precomputed factorials and the modular inverse function to compute the combinations and the final answer.

4. **Validation of the Main Logic**:
   - The program correctly checks the boundary conditions for the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It uses the precomputed factorials and modular inverses to efficiently compute the number of valid permutations.
   - The combinatorial logic is implemented correctly, ensuring that the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements between the prefix and suffix maximums is computed accurately.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the necessary logic to solve the problem of counting the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. The use of precomputed factorials and modular inverses ensures efficiency and correctness.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
