### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires determining the number of permutations of length \( n \) that have specific indices as their prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The result should be modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the GCD and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.
     - If \( b = 0 \), it returns \((1, 0)\).
     - If \( a < b \), it swaps \( a \) and \( b \) and calls itself recursively.
     - If \( a \% b = 0 \), it returns \((1, -(a // b - 1))\).
     - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with \( b \) and \( a \% b \) and adjusts the results.
   - **func_2(a, b)**: This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of \( a \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
     - It calls `func_1(b, 1000000007)` to get the coefficients.
     - It returns \( c \times a \mod 1000000007 \).

3. **Evaluating the Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program involves precomputing factorials and using them to calculate combinations.
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum are the same, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is \( n \). If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0.
   - For each suffix maximum, it calculates the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements using combinations and updates the answer.
   - Similarly, for each prefix maximum (excluding the first and last), it calculates the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements using combinations and updates the answer.
   - Finally, it multiplies the answer by the factorials of the gaps between consecutive prefix and suffix maximums.

4. **Validation of the Main Logic**:
   - The program correctly uses the precomputed factorials and modular inverses to calculate combinations.
   - The conditions checked (last prefix maximum equals first suffix maximum, first prefix maximum is 1, and last suffix maximum is \( n \)) are necessary to ensure the validity of the permutation.
   - The combination calculations and the multiplication of factorials for gaps are correctly implemented to count the number of valid permutations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. The use of precomputed factorials and modular inverses ensures efficient computation of combinations. The conditions checked are necessary and sufficient to ensure the validity of the permutations.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
