The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, where `b` is a non-negative integer. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1:** If `b` is 0, the function returns the tuple `(1, 0)`.
- **Case_2:** If `b` is greater than 0 and `a` is less than `b`, the function returns the values of `d` and `c`, which are the results of calling `func_1(b, a)`.
- **Case_3:** If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `a` is divisible by `b`, the function returns a tuple `(1, -(a // b - 1))`, where the second element is the negative of the quotient of `a` divided by `b` minus 1.
- **Case_4:** If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `a` is not divisible by `b`, the function returns a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)`, where `d` is the second result from `func_1(b, a % b)` and `c - a // b * d` is calculated using the first result `c` from `func_1(b, a % b)`, the integer division of `a` by `b` (`a // b`), and `d`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where `b` is a non-negative integer. It returns different tuples based on the relationship between `a` and `b`: (1, 0) if `b` is 0; the results of `func_1(b, a)` if `b` > 0 and `a` < `b`; (1, -(a // b - 1)) if `a` â‰¥ `b` and `a` is divisible by `b`; or (d, c - a // b * d) if `a` â‰¥ `b` and `a` is not divisible by `b`.**
