Reasoning:

The original assessment is partially correct in identifying that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not directly addressing the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. However, the assessment does not fully consider the context in which these functions are used within the main logic of the program.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Precomputation of Factorials:**
   ```python
   facts = [1]
   ch = 1
   for i in range(1, 200002):
       ch *= i
       ch %= 1000000007
       facts.append(ch)
   ```
   This part precomputes factorials up to \(200000!\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is necessary for efficiently computing combinations later in the program.

2. **Main Logic:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       (n, m1, m2) = map(int, input().split())
       p = list(map(int, input().split()))
       s = list(map(int, input().split()))
       if p[-1] != s[0] or p[0] != 1 or s[-1] != n:
           print(0)
       else:
           ans = 1
           kol = n
           for x in s:
               cnk = func_2(facts[kol - 1], facts[n - x] * facts[kol - 1 + x - n])
               ans *= cnk
               ans %= 1000000007
               kol = n - x
           kol = s[0] - 1
           p2 = []
           for i in range(m1 - 2, -1, -1):
               p2.append(p[i])
           for x in p2:
               cnk = func_2(facts[kol - 1], facts[x - 1] * facts[kol - x])
               ans *= cnk
               ans %= 1000000007
               kol = x - 1
           for i in range(m1 - 1):
               ans *= facts[p[i + 1] - p[i] - 1]
               ans %= 1000000007
           for i in range(m2 - 1):
               ans *= facts[s[i + 1] - s[i] - 1]
               ans %= 1000000007
           print(ans)
   ```

   - **Initial Checks:**
     ```python
     if p[-1] != s[0] or p[0] != 1 or s[-1] != n:
         print(0)
     ```
     This ensures that the last prefix maximum is the same as the first suffix maximum, the first prefix maximum is 1, and the last suffix maximum is \(n\). If any of these conditions fail, the permutation is invalid, and the program prints 0.

   - **Combination Calculations:**
     ```python
     for x in s:
         cnk = func_2(facts[kol - 1], facts[n - x] * facts[kol - 1 + x - n])
         ans *= cnk
         ans %= 1000000007
         kol = n - x
     ```
     This loop calculates the number of ways to place the remaining elements between the suffix maximums.

   - **Reverse Prefix Maximums:**
     ```python
     kol = s[0] - 1
     p2 = []
     for i in range(m1 - 2, -1, -1):
         p2.append(p[i])
     for x in p2:
         cnk = func_2(facts[kol - 1], facts[x - 1] * facts[kol - x])
         ans *= cnk
         ans %= 1000000007
         kol = x - 1
     ```
     This loop calculates the number of ways to place the remaining elements between the prefix maximums in reverse order.

   - **Factorial Multiplications:**
     ```python
     for i in range(m1 - 1):
         ans *= facts[p[i + 1] - p[i] - 1]
         ans %= 1000000007
     for i in range(m2 - 1):
         ans *= facts[s[i + 1] - s[i] - 1]
         ans %= 1000000007
     ```
     These loops multiply the factorials of the gaps between consecutive prefix and suffix maximums.

### Evaluation of Functions

- **`func_1` and `func_2`:**
  - `func_1` is an implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the modular inverse.
  - `func_2` uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse and then multiplies it with another number, returning the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

These functions are indeed used correctly to compute combinations and modular inverses, which are essential for the combinatorial calculations in the main logic.

### Conclusion

The program is correctly structured to solve the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. The use of `func_1` and `func_2` for modular arithmetic and combination calculations is appropriate and necessary for the solution.

Therefore, the original assessment is **inaccurate**.

Final: **True**
