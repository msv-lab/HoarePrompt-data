### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the function summary to verify its correctness step-by-step.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Processing Commands**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to the start and end of the array `a`, respectively.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and appends the appropriate element (either from the left or right) to the list `b` based on the command ('L' or 'R').
   - After processing all commands, the list `b` contains the elements in the order they were removed from the array `a`.

3. **Calculating Remainders**:
   - The program initializes `p` to 1, which will hold the cumulative product of the elements in `b` modulo `m`.
   - It iterates through the list `b` in reverse order, updating `p` with the product of the current element modulo `m`.
   - It appends the result to the list `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which corresponds to the remainders of the product of the array elements at the start of each command.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of Command Processing**:
  - The function correctly processes the commands by appending the appropriate element to `b` and adjusting the pointers `l` and `r` accordingly.
  - This ensures that the elements are removed in the correct order as specified by the commands in `s`.

- **Correctness of Remainder Calculation**:
  - The function calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, taking the modulo `m` at each step.
  - By returning the list `ans` in reverse order, it correctly outputs the remainders of the product of the array elements at the start of each command.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases such as:
    - When the array has only one element.
    - When all commands are 'L' or 'R'.
    - When the product of the elements is very large.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes the commands and calculates the remainders as required. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function `func_1`.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
