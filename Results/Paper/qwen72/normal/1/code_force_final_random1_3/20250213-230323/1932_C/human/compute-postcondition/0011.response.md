The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing either the first element of `a` if `s[0]` is 'L', or the last element of `a` if `s[0]` is 'R', `l` is 1 if `s[0]` is 'L' or remains 0 if `s[0]` is 'R', `r` is `n - 1` if `s[0]` is 'L' or `n - 2` if `s[0]` is 'R', `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1**
