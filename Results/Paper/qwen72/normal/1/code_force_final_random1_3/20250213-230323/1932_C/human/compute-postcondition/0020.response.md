Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list that now contains the element `a[l]` (where `l` is 2 if `s[0]` is 'L' or 1 if `s[0]` is 'R'), `l` is 3 if `s[0]` is 'L' or 2 if `s[0]` is 'R', `r` is `n - 1` if `s[0]` is 'L' or `n - 2` if `s[0]` is 'R', `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.**
