Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic as required by the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` is appending the elements being removed from the array `a` to the list `b`, but it should be calculating the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` at each step and then taking the modulus with `m`.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    product = 1
    for x in a:
        product = (product * x) % m
    for i in range(n):
        b.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[l], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove the leftmost element
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[r], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove the rightmost element
            r -= 1
    return b
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Initialization**: The product of all elements in the array `a` is calculated initially.
2. **Processing Commands**: For each command:
   - The current product is appended to the result list `b`.
   - If the command is 'L', the leftmost element is removed by dividing the product by the leftmost element and taking the modulus with `m`. This is done using the modular inverse (`pow(a[l], m-2, m)`).
   - If the command is 'R', the rightmost element is removed similarly.
3. **Return Result**: The list `b` containing the remainders of the product at each step is returned.

This corrected version ensures that the product is updated correctly after each removal operation, and the results match the problem requirements.
