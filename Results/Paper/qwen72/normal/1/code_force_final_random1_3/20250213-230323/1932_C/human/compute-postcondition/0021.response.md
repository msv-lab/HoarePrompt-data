The code `b.append(a[r])` appends the element at index `r` of the list `a` to the list `b`. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers within specified ranges.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'.
- `b` is a list constructed based on `s[0]`.
- `l` is 2 if `s[0]` is 'L' or remains 1 if `s[0]` is 'R'.
- `r` is `n - 1` if `s[0]` is 'L' or `n - 2` if `s[0]` is 'R'.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 2.

Let's determine the value of `r`:
- If `s[0]` is 'L', then `r = n - 1`.
- If `s[0]` is 'R', then `r = n - 2`.

The code appends `a[r]` to `b`. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `b` now contains the element `a[r]` appended to its existing elements.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list that is constructed based on the value of `s[0]` and now includes `a[r]` appended to it, `l` is 2 if `s[0]` is 'L' or remains 1 if `s[0]` is 'R', `r` is `n - 1` if `s[0]` is 'L' or `n - 2` if `s[0]` is 'R', `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.**
