#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.

    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either from the beginning or the end of `a` based on the corresponding character in `s`, `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', or some value between 0 and `n` depending on the number of 'L's in `s`, `r` is -1 if all characters in `s` are 'R', or some value between -1 and `n - 1` depending on the number of 'R's in `s`, `i` is `n - 1`.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `b`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is 0. The list `ans` contains `n` elements, where each element is the cumulative product of the elements in `b` (from the last to the first) taken modulo `m`. The variable `p` is the final value of this cumulative product, which is the product of all elements in `b` taken modulo `m`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` in reverse order, where `ans` contains `n` elements, each being the cumulative product of the elements in `b` (from the last to the first) taken modulo `m`. The cumulative product is calculated as the product of all elements in `b` taken modulo `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. It processes the list `a` based on the directions given by the string `s` ('L' or 'R') to create a new list `b`. Then, it computes a list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of the elements in `b` (from the last to the first) taken modulo `m`. Finally, it returns the list `ans` in reverse order. The returned list `ans` contains `n` elements, each representing the cumulative product of the elements in `b` up to that point, modulo `m`.
