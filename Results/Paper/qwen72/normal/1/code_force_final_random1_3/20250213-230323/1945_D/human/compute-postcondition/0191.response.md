The only objects in the loop head are the variable `y` and the constant `max_p`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `y` relative to 0. The loop iterates from `max_p - 1` down to 1 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `max_p - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1, making it `max_p - 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is greater than 0.

State: **`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is `max_p - 2`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `y` is `max_p - 2`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p`, plus the value of `b_values[y]`. If `y` is 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p` plus `a_values[max_p - 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
