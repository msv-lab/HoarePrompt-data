To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables directly involved in the loop head, which are `v`, `na_frente`, and the range parameters.

Given the loop:
```python
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

- The loop iterates over the range from `na_frente` down to 0 (inclusive) in steps of -1.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `na_frente` must be at least 0 (since the loop will stop when `v` is less than -1).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `na_frente` is at least 0, and `v` should start at `na_frente`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first input integer - 2 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second input integer - 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is 0, and `best` is 10^12**
