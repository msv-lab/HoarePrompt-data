Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first input integer - 2 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second input integer - 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`, `best` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `total` is incremented by the value at index `v` in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, `v`) remain unchanged.
- The variable `best` is not modified by this code snippet.
