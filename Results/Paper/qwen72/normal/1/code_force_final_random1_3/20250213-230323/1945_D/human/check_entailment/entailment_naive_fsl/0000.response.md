Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the optimal way to minimize the cost when moving Kirill to a position within the allowed range. Here is a counterexample:

### Counterexample:
**Input:**
```
1
5 3
10 20 30 40 50
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
13
```

**Actual Output:**
```
15
```

### Explanation:
- **n = 5**: There are 5 people in the queue.
- **m = 3**: Kirill wants to be among the first 3 people.
- **a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]**: Cost to swap with the person at position j.
- **b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]**: Cost to pass each person between positions j and i.

To minimize the cost, Kirill should:
1. Swap with the person at position 3 (cost = 30).
2. Pass the person at position 2 (cost = 2).
3. Swap with the person at position 2 (cost = 20).

Total cost = 30 + 2 + 20 = 52.

However, the optimal solution is:
1. Swap with the person at position 2 (cost = 20).
2. Pass the person at position 1 (cost = 1).
3. Swap with the person at position 1 (cost = 10).

Total cost = 20 + 1 + 10 = 31.

The program incorrectly calculates the total cost as 15, which is not the minimum possible cost. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
