The code snippet adds the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to the variable `total`. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `total`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer - 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `total` is now equal to the original `total` (which was 0) plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. Additionally, the cost to change at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the cost to pass at position `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`).**
