Output State: **After the loop completes all iterations, `custos` will contain `x` elements, each representing the total cost calculated for each test case. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial values. The variables `i`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, and `b` will have been updated for each iteration but do not retain any specific values from the last iteration since they are re-initialized at the start of each loop. The variable `custo` will be reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration and will hold the final cost for the current test case before being appended to `custos`.**
