Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop completes all iterations, `custos` will contain `x` elements, each representing the total cost calculated for each test case. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial values. The variables `i`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, and `b` will have been updated for each iteration but do not retain any specific values from the last iteration since they are re-initialized at the start of each loop. The variable `custo` will be reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration and will hold the final cost for the current test case before being appended to `custos`.
Code of the loop:
for c in custos:
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `custos` is a list containing at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `custos` is a list containing at least two elements

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `custos` is a list containing at least three elements, `c` is the third element in the list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
