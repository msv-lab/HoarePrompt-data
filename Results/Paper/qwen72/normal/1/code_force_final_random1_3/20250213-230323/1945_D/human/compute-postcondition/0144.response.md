Output State: **After all iterations, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t`, `c` is `t-1`, `na_frente` is the last input integer - 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the last input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each iteration from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` is the lowest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` encountered during the loop, where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the specified range, and `cases` is still equal to `t`.
- The loop counter `c` has reached the value `t-1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times.
- For the last test case, `na_frente` and `pos_final` are the last input integers minus 1, both of which must be non-negative.
- The lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the last set of input integers.
- The variable `v` is -1, indicating that the inner loop has completed.
- The variable `total` holds the sum of the minimum costs for each iteration from `na_frente` down to 0.
- The variable `best` holds the lowest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` encountered during the loop, where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.
