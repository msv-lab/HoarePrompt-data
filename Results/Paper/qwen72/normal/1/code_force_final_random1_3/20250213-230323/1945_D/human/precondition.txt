t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. a_i and b_i are lists of n integers each, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe the person at position i and the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i-1, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
