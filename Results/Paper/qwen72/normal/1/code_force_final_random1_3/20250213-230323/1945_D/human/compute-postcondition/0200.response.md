The code snippet `custo += b_values[y]` updates the value of `custo` by adding the value at index `y` of the list `b_values`. Given the initial state:

- `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces.
- `y` is `max_p - 3`.
- `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`.
- `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`.
- `max_p` must be greater than or equal to 3.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. `y` is calculated as `max_p - 3`.
2. `b_values[y]` accesses the element at index `y` in the list `b_values`.
3. `custo` is updated by adding the value of `b_values[y]` to its current value.

Since the exact value of `custo` is not provided, we can only say that it is incremented by the value of `b_values[y]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is `max_p - 3`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `custo` is incremented by the value of `b_values[max_p - 3]`.**
