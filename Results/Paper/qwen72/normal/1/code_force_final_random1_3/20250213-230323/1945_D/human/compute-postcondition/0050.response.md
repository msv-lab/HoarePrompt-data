Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first input integer - 1, `pos_final` is the second input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each iteration from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` is the lowest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` where `v <= pos_final`.**

Explanation:
- The code `custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input and splits it into integers, which are then stored in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The new value of `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input.
