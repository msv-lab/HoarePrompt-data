Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input.** 

The code reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `custo_pra_passar_b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
