The provided code snippet updates the `custo_pra_trocar_a` list by reading a sequence of integers from the input. This means that `custo_pra_trocar_a` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first input integer, `pos_final` is the second input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each iteration from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` is the lowest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` encountered when `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**
