Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` remains an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is `n + 1`, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the string `x`, and the new input string `x`. The lists `a` and `b` are not affected by the code snippet provided.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the string `x`, and the new input string `x`. If the character at position `j - 1` in the string `x` is 'F', then `a[3]` is incremented by 1, `a[j]` is incremented by 1, and `b` is not affected. If the character at position `j - 1` in the string `x` is not 'F' (and specifically if it is 'S'), then `b[3]` is incremented by 1, `b[j]` is incremented by 1, and `a` is not affected.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the string `x`, and the new input string `x`, `j` is 2. If `x[j - 1]` (which is `x[1]`) is 'F', then `a[3]` and `a[2]` are each incremented by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[2]` and `b[3]` are each incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `b[2]` and `b[3]` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the string `x`, and the new input string `x`, `j` is 3. If the last character of the new input string `x` is 'F', the value at index 3 of `a` is incremented by 1. If the last character of the new input string `x` is 'S', then `b[3]` is increased by 2. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
