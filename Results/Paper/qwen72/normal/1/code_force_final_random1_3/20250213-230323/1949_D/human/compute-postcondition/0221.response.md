Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by `n` input strings, `a` and `b` are updated based on the characters in each input string `x`, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, for each index `i` from 1 to `n`, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, then `sb` includes the index `i`, `nx` is an empty string, and the character at position `j-1` in the string `xx[i]` is `?`. Additionally, `i` is not in the first quarter of `sb` and `j` is not in the first quarter of `sb`.**
