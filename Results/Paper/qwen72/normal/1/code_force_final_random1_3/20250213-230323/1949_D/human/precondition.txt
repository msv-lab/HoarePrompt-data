n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. Characters are either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The character at the i-th row and j-th column is the same as the character at the j-th row and i-th column for all i and j, except when i = j, in which case the character is '.'. At most 2 * floor(n / 2) characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'.
