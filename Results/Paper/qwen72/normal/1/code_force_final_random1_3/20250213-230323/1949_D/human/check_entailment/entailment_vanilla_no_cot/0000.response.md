Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by categorizing scenarios into two groups based on whether they have more funny or scary transitions already defined. However, the logic used to assign the remaining transitions (those marked with '?') does not guarantee that the constraint of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type will be met for every possible permutation of scenarios.

Here are some issues with the solution:

1. **Incorrect Grouping Logic**: The solution divides scenarios into `sa` and `sb` based on whether they have more funny or scary transitions. This grouping might not be optimal for ensuring the required constraint on consecutive videos.

2. **Assignment of '?' Transitions**: The assignment of '?' transitions is done based on whether the scenario indices are in the first quarter of the `sa` or `sb` lists. This approach does not consider the overall balance of funny and scary transitions across all permutations, which is crucial for meeting the constraint.

3. **Lack of Validation**: The solution does not validate whether the generated transition matrix meets the requirement for all permutations of scenarios. This is a critical step that should be included to ensure correctness.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a backtracking algorithm to ensure that the constraint is met for all permutations. The current solution does not provide a robust method to guarantee the required properties of the transition videos.
