Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 24`, `i` is 2. If `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then `sa` now contains `[2]` and `sb` now contains `[1]`. If `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, then `sa` now contains `[2]` and `sb` now contains `[1, 2]`. Otherwise, `sa` now contains `[2]` and `sb` remains unchanged.***
