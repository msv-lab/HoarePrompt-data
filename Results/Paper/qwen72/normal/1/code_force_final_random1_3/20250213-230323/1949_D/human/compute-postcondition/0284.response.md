Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, and `i` is `n + 1`. `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[n + 1][1]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is `n + 1`.
- The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to it.
- Since `j` is 3, `j - 1` is 2.
- Therefore, `xx[i][j - 1]` is `xx[n + 1][2]`.
- The value of `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[n + 1][2]`.

All other variables (`xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`) remain unchanged.
