The provided code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a` by 1. However, the initial state does not specify the list `a` or the index `i`. Without these details, we cannot determine the exact new value of `a[i]`. However, we can state that the value at index `i` in the list `a` is incremented by 1.

The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is an integer starting at 2 and incrementing up to `n + 1`, the value at index `i` in the list `a` is incremented by 1.**
