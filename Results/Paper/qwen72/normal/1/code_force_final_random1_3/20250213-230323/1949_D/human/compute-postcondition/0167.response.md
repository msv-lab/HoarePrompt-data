The code snippet `nx += 'F'` attempts to concatenate the string `'F'` to the variable `nx`. However, `nx` is not defined in the initial state, which means this operation would raise a `NameError` because `nx` does not exist.

Since the code raises an error, no changes are made to the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3**
