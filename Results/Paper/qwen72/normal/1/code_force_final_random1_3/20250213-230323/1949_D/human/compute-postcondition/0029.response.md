Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, and `j` is 3. If the element at index `j - 1` (which is 2) in the list `x` is 'F', then the element at index 3 in the list `a` is incremented by 1. If the element at index `j - 1` in the list `x` is 'S', then the element at index 3 in the list `b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the lists `x`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.***
