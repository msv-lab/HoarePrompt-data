Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, `i` is `n + 1`, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus `'F'`.** 

The variable `nx` is updated by appending the character `'F'` to its original value. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
