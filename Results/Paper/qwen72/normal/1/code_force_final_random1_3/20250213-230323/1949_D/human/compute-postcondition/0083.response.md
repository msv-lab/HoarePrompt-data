The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[3]` by 1. Given that `j` is 3 and `b[3]` was already increased by 1 before, the value of `b[3]` is now increased by another 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the string `x`, and the new input string `x`, `j` is 3, `b[3]` is increased by 2.**
