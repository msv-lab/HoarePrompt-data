To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the string `nx`.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).
- `j` is `n + 1`.
- `nx` is a string constructed by iterating through the characters of `xx[2]` from index 0 to `n-1`.

### Construction of `nx`:
1. Iterate through the characters of `xx[2]` from index 0 to `n-1`.
2. For each character at index `k`:
   - If the character is not `'?'`, append it to `nx`.
   - If the character is `'?'`:
     - Check if `i` or `k + 1` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.
     - If true, append `'F'` to `nx`.
     - Otherwise, append `'S'` to `nx`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the range of `k`:**
   - `k` ranges from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Check the conditions for each character:**
   - If the character at `xx[2][k]` is not `'?'`, it is directly appended to `nx`.
   - If the character at `xx[2][k]` is `'?'`:
     - Check if `i` (which is 2) or `k + 1` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.
     - If either condition is true, append `'F'` to `nx`.
     - Otherwise, append `'S'` to `nx`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume a specific example to illustrate the process:
- Suppose `n = 8`.
- Suppose `xx[2] = "a?b?c?d?"`.
- Suppose `sa = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.

#### Iteration through `xx[2]`:
- `k = 0`: Character is `'a'` (not `'?'`), append `'a'` to `nx`.
- `k = 1`: Character is `'?'`, check if `i` (2) or `k + 1` (2) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` (which are `[1, 2]`). Since 2 is in `[1, 2]`, append `'F'` to `nx`.
- `k = 2`: Character is `'b'` (not `'?'`), append `'b'` to `nx`.
- `k = 3`: Character is `'?'`, check if `i` (2) or `k + 1` (4) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` (which are `[1, 2]`). Since 4 is not in `[1, 2]`, append `'S'` to `nx`.
- `k = 4`: Character is `'c'` (not `'?'`), append `'c'` to `nx`.
- `k = 5`: Character is `'?'`, check if `i` (2) or `k + 1` (6) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` (which are `[1, 2]`). Since 6 is not in `[1, 2]`, append `'S'` to `nx`.
- `k = 6`: Character is `'d'` (not `'?'`), append `'d'` to `nx`.
- `k = 7`: Character is `'?'`, check if `i` (2) or `k + 1` (8) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` (which are `[1, 2]`). Since 8 is not in `[1, 2]`, append `'S'` to `nx`.

### Final String `nx`:
- `nx = "aFbScSdS"`

### General Output:
Since the exact values of `xx[2]` and `sa` are not provided, we can only describe the process and the general form of the output.

Output: **nx (where nx is constructed by iterating through the characters of xx[2] from index 0 to n-1, appending non-'?' characters directly, and appending 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions described)**
