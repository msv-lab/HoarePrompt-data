Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3. If `xx[2][2]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is increased by the value at `xx[2][2]`. If `xx[2][2]` is equal to '?', and if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, the postcondition remains as stated. Otherwise, a `NameError` occurs because `nx` is not defined.***
