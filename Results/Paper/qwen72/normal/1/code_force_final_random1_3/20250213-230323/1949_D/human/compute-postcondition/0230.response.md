Postcondition: ***`j` is 2. If `xx[i][1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to `nx` + `xx[i][1]`. Otherwise, if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, `nx` is updated to `nx` + `'S'`. Otherwise, `nx` is updated to `nx` + `'F'`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`) remain unchanged.***
