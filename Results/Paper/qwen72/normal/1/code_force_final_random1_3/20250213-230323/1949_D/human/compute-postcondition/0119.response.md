Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by `n` input strings, `a` and `b` are updated based on the characters in each input string `x`. If `a[3] == 0` and `b[3] == 0`, `sa` now includes the value 3, and if `a[2] == 0` and `b[2] == 0`, `sa` also includes the index `2`, and `sb` remains unchanged. If `a[1] == 0` and `b[1] == 0`, `sa` also includes the index `1`, and the length of `sa` is still greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. If `a[3] != 0` or `b[3] != 0`, `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged.***
