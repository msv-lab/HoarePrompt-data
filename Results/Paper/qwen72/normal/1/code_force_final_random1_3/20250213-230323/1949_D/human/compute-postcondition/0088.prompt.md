Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, and `n` is now the value of the input integer; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros; `xx` is a list containing an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    x = input()
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if x[j - 1] == 'F':
            a[i] += 1
            a[j] += 1
        elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
            b[i] += 1
            b[j] += 1
    xx.append(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` has completed its range from 1 to `n`, `a` and `b` are updated based on the characters in the input string `x`, `i` remains 1, `xx` is now a list containing an empty string and the string `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the string `x`, and the new input string `x`. The lists `a` and `b` are not affected by the code snippet provided.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `n` remains an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the string `x`, and the new input string `x` appended again. The lists `a` and `b` will reflect the increments based on the characters in the string `x` as described in the initial state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
