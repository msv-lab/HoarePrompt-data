Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 24, `j` is 1, `i` is 2, `xx` is now a list containing an empty string and the string `x`, `x` is the new input string. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'F', `a[1]` and `a[2]` are each incremented by 1, and `b` is updated based on the characters in the input string `x`. If the character at index 0 of `x` is not 'F' but is 'S', `b[1]` is incremented by 1, and `a` and `b` are updated based on the characters in the input string `x`. If the character at index 0 of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', only `a` and `b` are updated based on the characters in the input string `x`.***
