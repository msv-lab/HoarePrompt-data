Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, and `j` is an integer starting at 1 and incrementing up to `n`. If the character at position `j - 1` in the list `x` is 'F', the value at index `j` in the list `a` is incremented by 1. If the character at position `j - 1` in the list `x` is 'S', the value at index `j` in the list `b` is incremented by 1. If the character at position `j - 1` in the list `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
