Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the string `x`, and the new input string `x`, `j` is 2. If `x[j - 1]` (which is `x[1]`) is 'F', then `a[3]` and `a[2]` are each incremented by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[2]` and `b[3]` are each incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `b[2]` and `b[3]` remain unchanged.***
