The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the end of the string `nx`. Since `nx` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty string or a string that remains unchanged except for the addition of 'F'. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, `nx` is now the original value of `nx` plus 'F'.**
