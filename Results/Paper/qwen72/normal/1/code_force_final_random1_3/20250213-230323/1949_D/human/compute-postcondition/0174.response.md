Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `nx = ''` reassigns the variable `nx` to an empty string.
- The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The initial state specified that `nx` was constructed based on certain conditions involving `xx[2]`, `i`, and `sa`. However, the new assignment `nx = ''` overrides this construction, making `nx` an empty string.
- All other conditions and values from the initial state remain valid.
