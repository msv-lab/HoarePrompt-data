Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1. If the character at position `[i][j - 1]` in the array `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is the character at position `[i][j - 1]` in the array `xx`. If the character at position `[i][j - 1]` in the array `xx` is '?', then `nx` is 'F' if either `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.***
