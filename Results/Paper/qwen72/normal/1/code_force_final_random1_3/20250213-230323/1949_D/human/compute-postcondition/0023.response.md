The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is an integer starting at 2 and incrementing up to `n + 1`, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.

At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `j` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must still be less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, and `j` is 3**
