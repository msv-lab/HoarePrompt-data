Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the string `x`, and the new input string `x`. If the character at position `j - 1` in the string `x` is 'F', then `a[3]` is incremented by 1, `a[j]` is incremented by 1, and `b` is not affected. If the character at position `j - 1` in the string `x` is not 'F' (and specifically if it is 'S'), then `b[3]` is incremented by 1, `b[j]` is incremented by 1, and `a` is not affected.***
