Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is an integer starting at 2 and incrementing up to `n + 1`, `b[j]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 2 and 24.
- The value of `j` remains unchanged and is still an integer starting at 2 and incrementing up to `n + 1`.
- The value of `b[j]` is incremented by 1. This means that the element in the list `b` at the index `j` is now one more than its previous value.
