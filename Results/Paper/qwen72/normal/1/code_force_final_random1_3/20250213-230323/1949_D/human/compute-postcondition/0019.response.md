The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the value of the element at index `i` in the list `b` by 1. However, the initial state does not specify the values of `b` or `i`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `b[i]` without knowing its initial value.

However, the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, and `j` is an integer starting at 2 and incrementing up to `n + 1`. These conditions remain unchanged by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is an integer starting at 2 and incrementing up to `n + 1`, `b[i]` is incremented by 1.**
