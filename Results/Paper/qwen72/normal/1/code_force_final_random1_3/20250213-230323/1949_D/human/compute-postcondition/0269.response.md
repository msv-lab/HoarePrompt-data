Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, `nx` is the character at position `i` in the string `xx[0]`, `i` is `n + 1`, and the character at position `i` in the string `xx[0]` is not equal to '?'**

Explanation:
- The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at position `i` in the string `xx[0]` (since `j - 1` is 0) to the string `nx`.
- Initially, `nx` was an empty string, so after the execution, `nx` contains the character at position `i` in `xx[0]`.
- All other variables (`j`, `n`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
