Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2, `i` is 2, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the string `x`, `x` is the new input string. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'F', `a[2]` is incremented by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', `b[2]` is incremented by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
