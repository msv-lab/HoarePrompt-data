Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, and `j` is an integer starting at 2 and incrementing up to `n + 1`. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', the value at index `j` in the list `a` is incremented by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', the value at index `j` in the list `b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b[j]` remains unchanged.***
