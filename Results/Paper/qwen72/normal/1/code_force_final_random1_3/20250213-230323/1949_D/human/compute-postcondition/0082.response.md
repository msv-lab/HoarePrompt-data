Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the string `x`, and the new input string `x`, `j` is 3, `b[3]` is increased by 1.** 

Explanation: The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` (which is 3) in the list `b` by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
