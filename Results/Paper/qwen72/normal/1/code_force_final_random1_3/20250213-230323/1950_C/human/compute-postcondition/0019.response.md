Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1441, `s` is the new user input string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, and `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive), which represents the hours part of the time. If `int(h) <= 12`, the program continues with the current values of `t`, `s`, and `h`. Otherwise, the program continues with the same values of `t`, `s`, and `h`.***
