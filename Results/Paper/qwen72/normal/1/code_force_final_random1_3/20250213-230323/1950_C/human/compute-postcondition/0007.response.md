Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a user input string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
- `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive), which means `h` represents the hours part of the time.
- The integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12 and `h` is not '00'.

Given these conditions, the `print(h, end='')` statement will print the hours part of the time string `s` without a newline at the end.

For example, if the user input `s` is "09:30", then `h` would be "09".

Output: **h (where h is the hours part of the time string s, and h is a string representing a number between 01 and 12 inclusive)**

In a more specific example:
If `s` is "07:45", then `h` is "07".
Output: **07**
