Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the hour is '10' to '12' correctly in the 12-hour format. Specifically, when the hour is '10', '11', or '12', the program incorrectly formats the hour as '010', '011', and '012' respectively, instead of '10', '11', and '12'. This is due to the line `print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')` which adds an unnecessary leading zero for these hours.

For example, for the input "10:30", the program will output "010:30 AM" instead of the correct "10:30 AM".
