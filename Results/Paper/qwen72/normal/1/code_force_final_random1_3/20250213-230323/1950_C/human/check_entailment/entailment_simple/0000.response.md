Reasoning:

- The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through them.
- For each test case, it reads a time in 24-hour format.
- It extracts the hour part (`h`) and the minute part (`s[2:]`).
- The program handles the conversion from 24-hour to 12-hour format correctly:
  - If the hour is `00`, it converts it to `12`.
  - If the hour is between `01` and `12`, it keeps it as is.
  - If the hour is between `13` and `23`, it subtracts `12` and formats it with a leading zero if necessary.
- It correctly appends `AM` or `PM` based on whether the hour is less than or equal to 12.
- The program prints the time in the required format for each test case.

Given that the program follows the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
