Output State: **`t` is an integer where `t` equals the initial value of `t` provided as input, and `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format. The loop has completed all its iterations, and the program has printed the converted time for each input `s` in 12-hour format followed by 'AM' or 'PM'. The variable `h` is no longer relevant as it is recalculated in each iteration based on the new input `s`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains the same as the initial input value, and the variable `s` holds the last input time string in the format "hh:mm". The loop has processed each input time, converting it to a 12-hour format and appending 'AM' or 'PM' as appropriate, and these conversions have been printed to the console. The variable `h`, which was used within the loop to extract the hour part of the time, is no longer relevant outside the loop.
