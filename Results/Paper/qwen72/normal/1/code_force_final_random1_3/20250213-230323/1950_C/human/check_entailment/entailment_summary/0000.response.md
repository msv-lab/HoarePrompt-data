Reasoning:  
The program correctly processes the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format for each test case. It handles edge cases such as '00:00' converting to '12:00 AM' and '12:00' converting to '12:00 PM'. The logic for determining whether the time is 'AM' or 'PM' is also correct, using the condition `int(h) >= 12`. The program prints the results in the required format, including leading zeros where necessary.

However, there is a minor issue with the formatting when the hour is between 13 and 23. The program uses `'0{}'.format(int(h) - 12)` which will add a leading zero to hours that should not have one (e.g., '13:00' becomes '01:00 PM' instead of '01:00 PM'). To fix this, the format string should be adjusted to remove the leading zero for these cases.

Despite this minor issue, the program still produces the correct output for the given examples. However, for a fully correct solution, the format string should be adjusted.

Correctness: **False**

To make the program fully correct, the line:
```python
print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
```
should be changed to:
```python
print('{:02d}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
```

This ensures that the hour is always formatted correctly with two digits.
