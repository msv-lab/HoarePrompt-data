Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop, the health of each monster in the list `a` will be reduced according to the number of bullets fired, and the variable `rest` will be 0 or the remaining bullets that could not be used because there were no more monsters with non-zero health to target. The variable `pos` will be an index less than the length of `sorted_indices` indicating the next monster to target, or it will be equal to the length of `sorted_indices` if all monsters have been defeated. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, `distance`) will retain their initial values, except `distance` which is now `distance + 1`. If `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`, the program returns False.**
