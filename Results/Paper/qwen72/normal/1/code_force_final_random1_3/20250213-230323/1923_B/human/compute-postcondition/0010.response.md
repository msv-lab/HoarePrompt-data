To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `x` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Variables**:
   - `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `x` is a list of integers read from the input.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1(a, x, k)` is called with the lists `a` and `x`, and the integer `k` as arguments.
   - The result of this function call determines the output of the `print` statement.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - If `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `True`, the `print` statement will output `'YES'`.
   - If `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `False`, the `print` statement will output `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific boolean value it will return. However, based on the structure of the problem, the `print` statement will output either `'YES'` or `'NO'` depending on the result of `func_1(a, x, k)`.

Output: **'YES' or 'NO' (depending on the result of `func_1(a, x, k)`)**
