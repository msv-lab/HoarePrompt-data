The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `a`, `x`, and `k`. `a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, and `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second. The lengths of `a` and `x` are equal, and for each `i`, `x[i]` is non-zero and the `x` values are strictly increasing in absolute value. 

The function returns `False` in the first three cases and `True` in the fourth case. Based on the given information, the function likely evaluates whether it is possible to defeat all the monsters under the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `a` (a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster), `x` (a list of integers representing the initial positions of the monsters), and `k` (a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second). It returns `True` if it is possible to defeat all the monsters under the given constraints, and `False` otherwise.**
