Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`; `rest` is now `rest - delta`; `pos` remains unchanged; `distance` remains unchanged; `a` remains unchanged; `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` retain their initial values.**

Explanation:
- `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`.
- `rest` is updated to `rest - delta`.
- All other variables (`pos`, `distance`, `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices`) remain unchanged.
