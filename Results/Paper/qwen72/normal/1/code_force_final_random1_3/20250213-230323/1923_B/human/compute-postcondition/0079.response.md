Postcondition: ***`rest` is `k - 3*delta`, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, `pos` is increased by 1, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is set to `-delta`, `distance` is incremented by 1, `delta` is updated to the minimum of `k - delta` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-2]]` is 0. In both cases, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`, and all other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) retain their initial values.***
