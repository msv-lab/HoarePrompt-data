Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the health of each monster in the list `a` will be reduced to 0 or lower, and the variable `pos` will be equal to the length of `sorted_indices`, indicating that all monsters have been defeated. The variable `distance` will be the final distance value reached during the loop's execution, which is the maximum distance any monster was from the origin when it was defeated. The variable `rest` will be 0, as all available bullets have been used or there are no more monsters to target. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) will retain their initial values.**
