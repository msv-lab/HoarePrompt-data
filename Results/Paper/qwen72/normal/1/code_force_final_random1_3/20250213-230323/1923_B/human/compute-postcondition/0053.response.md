Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, `rest` is `rest - delta`, `pos` is `pos + 1`, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]] - delta`, `distance` remains unchanged, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` retain their initial values.** 

Explanation:
- `pos` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `delta`, `rest`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` remain as they were calculated in the initial state.
- `distance`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` are not affected and retain their initial values.
