Output State: **`rest` is `k - delta`, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`, `distance` is `distance + 1`, `delta` is the minimum of `k` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`, all other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) retain their initial values.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`.
- All other variables (`rest`, `pos`, `distance`, `delta`, `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
