To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `x` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `_` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Values**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `k` are read from the input.
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n`.
   - `x` is another list of integers of length `n`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1(a, x, k)` is called with the lists `a` and `x`, and the integer `k` as arguments.
   - The result of this function call determines what will be printed.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - If `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `True`, the string `'YES'` will be printed.
   - If `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `False`, the string `'NO'` will be printed.

### Determining the Output:
- The output depends entirely on the return value of `func_1(a, x, k)`.
- Since the implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact return value of the function.
- However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `'YES'` or `'NO'` depending on the result of `func_1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **'YES' or 'NO' (where the output depends on the return value of `func_1(a, x, k)`)**
