You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, x, k):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))
    distance = 0
    pos = 0
    while pos != len(sorted_indices):
        if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:
            return False
        rest = k
        while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
            delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
            rest -= delta
            a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
            if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
                pos += 1
        distance += 1
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of monsters (`n`), the firing rate (`k`), the health of each monster (`a`), and their initial positions (`x`). For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to defeat all the monsters and prints 'YES' if it is possible, otherwise 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the input variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` are no longer relevant as they were used within the scope of the function.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can kill all monsters before any of them reach the player's position (0).
   - Each monster has a health (`a_i`) and an initial position (`x_i`).
   - Every second, we can fire up to `k` bullets, each reducing a monster's health by 1.
   - After firing, all alive monsters move 1 unit closer to the player.
   - If any monster reaches the player, the player loses.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The function sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player (`abs(x[i])`).
     - It then iterates through the sorted list, attempting to kill the closest monsters first.
     - For each second, it checks if the closest monster has reached the player (`abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`). If so, it returns `False`.
     - It then fires up to `k` bullets at the closest monsters, reducing their health accordingly.
     - If a monster's health reaches 0, it is considered dead, and the position index is incremented.
     - The process continues until all monsters are killed or a monster reaches the player.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where a monster reaches the player.
   - It also correctly handles the case where all monsters are killed before reaching the player.

4. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints "YES" if the player can survive, or "NO" otherwise.

5. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The input handling in `func_2` is correct, reading the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.
   - The output is correctly formatted as "YES" or "NO".

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters before any of them reach the player. The algorithm is sound and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
