Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`; `a` is updated such that the health of the monster at the position `sorted_indices[pos]` is reduced by `delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` becomes 0, the health of the monster at the position `sorted_indices[pos-1]` is reduced by `delta` and is now 0, and `pos` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, `distance`, `rest`) retain their previous values, and `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`.**
