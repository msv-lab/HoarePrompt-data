Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `x`. This updates the value of `x` to a new list of integers. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `_`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `x` and retains the initial state of all other variables.
