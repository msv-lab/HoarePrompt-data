Output State: **`rest` is `k - 2*delta`, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `distance` is `distance + 1`, `delta` is the minimum of `k - delta` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is 0. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) retain their initial values.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rest` is updated by subtracting `delta` from its current value, which was `k - delta`. Therefore, `rest` becomes `k - 2*delta`.
- The values of `pos`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `distance`, `delta`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` remain unchanged.
- All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) retain their initial values.
