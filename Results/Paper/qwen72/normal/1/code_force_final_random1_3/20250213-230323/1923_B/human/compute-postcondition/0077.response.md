Output State: **`rest` is `k - 3*delta`, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `pos` is increased by 1, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is `-delta`, `distance` is `distance + 1`, `delta` is the minimum of `k - delta` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-2]]` is 0. Otherwise, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` remains `-delta`, and all other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) retain their initial values. `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged from the initial state.
