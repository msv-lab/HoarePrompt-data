The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of monsters (`n`), the firing rate (`k`), the health of each monster (`a`), and their initial positions (`x`). For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to defeat all the monsters and prints 'YES' if it is possible, otherwise 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the input variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` are no longer relevant as they were used within the scope of the function.
