Postcondition: **`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`; `rest` is `rest - delta`; `pos` is an index less than the length of `sorted_indices` indicating the next monster to target; `distance` is `distance + 1`; `a` is a list where the health of each monster has been reduced according to the number of bullets fired, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`, which is 0; `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` retain their initial values. If `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`, the program returns `False`.**
