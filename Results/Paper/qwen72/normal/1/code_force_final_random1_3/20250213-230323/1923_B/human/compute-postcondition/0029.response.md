Postcondition: ***`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. `rest` is now `rest - delta`. `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` becomes 0, then `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, `rest` is now `rest - delta`, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]] - delta`, and `pos` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, `distance`) retain their previous values.***
