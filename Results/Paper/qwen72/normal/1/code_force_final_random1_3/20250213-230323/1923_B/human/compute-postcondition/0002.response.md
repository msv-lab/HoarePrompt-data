The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This operation updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `x` is a list of n distinct integers where -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0, `_` is 0.**
