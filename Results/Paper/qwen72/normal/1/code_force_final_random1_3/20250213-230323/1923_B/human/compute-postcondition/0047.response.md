Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`; `rest` is now `rest - delta`; `pos` is now `pos + 1`; `distance` remains unchanged; `a` is updated such that `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]] - delta`; `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` retain their initial values.**
