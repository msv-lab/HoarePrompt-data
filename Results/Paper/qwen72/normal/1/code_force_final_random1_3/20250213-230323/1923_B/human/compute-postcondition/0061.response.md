To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```python
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `rest`
   - `pos`
   - `len(sorted_indices)`

2. **Current State:**
   - `rest` is `k`
   - `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`
   - `distance` is `distance + 1`
   - All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) retain their initial values.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
     - `rest != 0`
     - `pos != len(sorted_indices)`

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - **`rest`**: Since `rest` is `k`, and `k` is not specified to be zero, `rest` is already non-zero. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `rest`.
   - **`pos`**: The current state specifies that `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`. This means `pos` is already not equal to `len(sorted_indices)`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `pos`.

Since both conditions in the `while` loop head are already satisfied with the given state, no adjustments are necessary.

### Final State:
State: **`rest` is `k`, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`, `distance` is `distance + 1`, all other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) retain their initial values.**
