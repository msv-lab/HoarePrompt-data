Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, and that `n` and `k` are updated to values read from the input.
- The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two values from the input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k`.
- The values of `a`, `x`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- After executing the code, `n` and `k` are now specific integers read from the input, while the other variables retain their initial conditions.
