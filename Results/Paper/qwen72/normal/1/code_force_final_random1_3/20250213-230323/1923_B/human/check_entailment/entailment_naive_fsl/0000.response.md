Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Sorting by Distance**: The `func_1` function sorts the indices of the monsters based on their absolute distances from the player. This ensures that the closest monsters are handled first, which is crucial because the player needs to prioritize killing the closest monsters to avoid being killed.

2. **Bullet Management**: The function uses a loop to manage the firing of bullets. It iterates through the sorted indices and fires up to `k` bullets per second, reducing the health of the targeted monsters accordingly. If a monster's health drops to zero, it is removed from consideration.

3. **Distance Check**: After each round of firing, the function checks if any monster has reached the player's position (i.e., if the distance is zero). If so, the function returns `False`, indicating that the player cannot survive.

4. **Test Case Handling**: The `func_2` function handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. It reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the appropriate result (`YES` or `NO`).

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description. For example, it correctly handles cases where the number of bullets per second is limited, and it ensures that the player can survive by prioritizing the closest monsters. The program also correctly handles the case where the player cannot survive if the number of bullets is insufficient to kill the closest monsters before they reach the player.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
