To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `x` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the `print` statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function Call**: The `print` statement calls the function `func_1(a, x, k)`.
2. **Conditional Print**: The `print` statement will print 'YES' if the result of `func_1(a, x, k)` is `True`, and 'NO' if it is `False`.

### Determining the Output:
- The output depends entirely on the return value of `func_1(a, x, k)`.
- Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact return value of `func_1(a, x, k)` without knowing the implementation of the function.

### Conclusion:
Without the definition of `func_1`, we cannot predict the exact output. However, based on the structure of the `print` statement, the output will be either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the return value of `func_1(a, x, k)`.

### Final Output:
Output: **'YES' if `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `True`, otherwise 'NO'**.
