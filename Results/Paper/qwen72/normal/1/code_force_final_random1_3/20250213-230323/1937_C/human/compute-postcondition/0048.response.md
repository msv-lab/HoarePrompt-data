The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `k` is 1 if `res` is not `<`, otherwise `k` is 2. `best` is the last index `i` for which `res` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `best` remains 0. `res` is an input string, and if `res` is `<`, the current value of `res` is `<`.**
