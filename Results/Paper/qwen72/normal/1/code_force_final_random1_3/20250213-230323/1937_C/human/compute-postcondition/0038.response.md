Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- `i` is equal to `n-1`.
- `k` is the last index `i` for which the input `res` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `k` remains 1.
- `best` is the last index `i` for which `res` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `best` remains 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('!', k, best, flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `k` and `best`:**
   - `k` and `best` are both determined based on the condition where `res` was `<`.
   - If there is no index `i` where `res` was `<`, then:
     - `k` remains 1.
     - `best` remains 0.
   - If there is an index `i` where `res` was `<`, then:
     - `k` is the last such index.
     - `best` is also the last such index.

2. **Print Statement Execution:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'!'`, followed by the values of `k` and `best`.

### Final Output:
- If no index `i` exists where `res` was `<`:
  - `k` is 1.
  - `best` is 0.
  - Output: **! 1 0**
- If there is an index `i` where `res` was `<`:
  - `k` is the last such index.
  - `best` is the last such index.
  - Output: **! [k] [best]** (where `[k]` and `[best]` are the last indices where `res` was `<`).

Since the exact value of `k` and `best` depends on the specific conditions of the input `res`, the most precise description is:

Output: **! [k] [best] (where [k] and [best] are the last indices where `res` was `<`, or 1 and 0 respectively if no such indices exist)**
