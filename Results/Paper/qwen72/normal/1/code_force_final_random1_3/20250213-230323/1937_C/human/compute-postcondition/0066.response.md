The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` remains 1 if no such `i` exists where `res` was `<`, `best` is 0, `res` is the input string. If `res` is `<`, then `best` is 1 and `res` remains the input string. Otherwise, `best` remains 0 and `res` remains the input string.**
