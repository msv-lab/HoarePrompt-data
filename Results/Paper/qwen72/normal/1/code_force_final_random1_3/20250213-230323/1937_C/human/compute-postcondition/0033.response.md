Let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `k` is 1.
- `best` is 0.
- `res` is a new input string.
- If `res` is '<', then `best` is updated to 2.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will print a string starting with a question mark (`?`).
- It will then print the value of `k`, which is 1.
- Next, it will print the value of `best`. According to the initial state, `best` is initially 0, but if `res` is '<', `best` is updated to 2. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `res`, we must consider both possibilities:
  - If `res` is not '<', `best` remains 0.
  - If `res` is '<', `best` is updated to 2.
- After `best`, it will print the value of `k` again, which is 1.
- Finally, it will print the value of `i`, which is 3.

### Possible Outputs:
1. If `res` is not '<':
   - `best` remains 0.
   - The output will be: `? 1 0 1 3`.

2. If `res` is '<':
   - `best` is updated to 2.
   - The output will be: `? 1 2 1 3`.

### Final Output:
Since the initial state does not specify the value of `res`, we cannot determine the exact value of `best` without additional information. Therefore, we need to consider both cases.

Output: **? 1 [best] 1 3 (where [best] is 0 if res is not '<', and 2 if res is '<')**
