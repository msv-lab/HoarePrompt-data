Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `k` is 3, `best` is the last `i` for which `res` was `<` or 0 if no such `i` exists, and `res` is the new input string from the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `k = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `k`.
- The other variables (`n`, `best`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the updated state is that `k` is now 3, while the rest of the initial state remains the same.
