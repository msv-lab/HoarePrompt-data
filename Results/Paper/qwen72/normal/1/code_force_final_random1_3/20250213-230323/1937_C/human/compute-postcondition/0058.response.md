Output State: **`n` is the same as the initial input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the last index `i` for which `res` was `<`, if no such `i` exists, `k` remains 1. `best` is the last index `i` for which `res` was `<`, if no such `i` exists, `best` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = n-1`.
- For each iteration, the loop checks if `res` is `<`. If it is, `k` is updated to the current value of `i`.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs up to but not including `n`.
- `k` will be the last index `i` for which `res` was `<`, or it will remain 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `best` will also be the last index `i` for which `res` was `<`, or it will remain 0 if no such `i` exists.
