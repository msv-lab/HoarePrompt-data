The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is 1, `best` is 0, and `res` is an input string. If `res` is `<`, then `best` is set to 1.**
