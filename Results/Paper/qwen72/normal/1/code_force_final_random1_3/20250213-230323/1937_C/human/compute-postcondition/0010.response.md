Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `res` is the input provided by the user.
- If `res` is `<`, then `k` is set to 2.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

1. The first argument is the string `'?'`.
2. The second argument is the integer `0`.
3. The third argument is the variable `k`. According to the initial state, if `res` is `<`, then `k` is set to 2. Since the initial state specifies this condition, we assume `k` is 2.
4. The fourth argument is the integer `0`.
5. The fifth argument is the variable `i`, which is 3.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output:

Output: **? 0 2 0 3**
