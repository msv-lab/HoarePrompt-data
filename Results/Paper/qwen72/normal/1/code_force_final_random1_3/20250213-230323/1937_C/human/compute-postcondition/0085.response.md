The value of `k` is updated to the current value of `i`. Since `i` is described as irrelevant, its specific value is not known, but it is now also the value of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is irrelevant, `k` is `i`, `best` is the last `i` for which `res` was `<` or 0 if no such `i` exists, `res` is the input string from the user, and the current value of `res` is `<`.**
