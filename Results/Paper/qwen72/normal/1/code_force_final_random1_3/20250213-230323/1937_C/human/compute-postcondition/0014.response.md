The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4, and `n` must still be greater than 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, and `res` is the new input provided by the user. If `res` is `<`, then `k` is set to 2. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.**
