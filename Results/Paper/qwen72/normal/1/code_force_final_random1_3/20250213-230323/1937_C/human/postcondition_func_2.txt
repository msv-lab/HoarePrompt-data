The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. It reads an integer `n` from the user input, where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\). If `n` is 2, it calls `func_2(0, 1)` and exits. Otherwise, it determines the maximum index `max_index` based on the results of `func_1` comparisons. It then finds the minimum indices `min_indices` that are less than or equal to `max_index` using `func_1` comparisons. Finally, it selects the last element in `min_indices` that is equal to `min_index` and calls `func_2(max_index, min_index)`. The function modifies the state of the program by setting `max_index`, `min_indices`, and `min_index` based on the results of `func_1` and `func_2` calls.
