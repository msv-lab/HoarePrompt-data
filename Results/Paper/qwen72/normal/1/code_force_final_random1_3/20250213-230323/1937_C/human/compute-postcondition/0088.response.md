Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `k` is 1 if `res` is not `<`, otherwise `k` is `i`.
- `best` is the last `i` for which `res` was `<` or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `res` remains the input string from the user.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `k`:**
   - If `res` is not `<`, then `k` is 1.
   - If `res` is `<`, then `k` is `i` (which is 3).

2. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.

3. **Construct the output:**
   - The print statement will always start with `'?'`.
   - The next value is `0`.
   - The third value is `k`, which depends on the value of `res`.
   - The fourth value is `0`.
   - The fifth value is `i`, which is 3.

### Possible Outputs:
- If `res` is not `<`, then `k` is 1.
  - Output: **? 0 1 0 3**
- If `res` is `<`, then `k` is 3.
  - Output: **? 0 3 0 3**

### Final Output:
Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both cases. However, the most precise description based on the given information is:

Output: **? 0 [k] 0 3 (where [k] is 1 if res is not '<', otherwise [k] is 3)**
