Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `k` is 1.
   - `best` is 0.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - If `res` is `<`, then `best` is set to 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `k` is 1.
   - `best` is initially 0, but if `res` is `<`, it is set to 1.
   - `i` is 2.

4. **Evaluate the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement will print the following values in order:
     - The string `'?'`
     - The value of `k` (which is 1)
     - The value of `best` (which could be 0 or 1 depending on the value of `res`)
     - The value of `k` again (which is 1)
     - The value of `i` (which is 2)

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `res` is `<`, then `best` is 1.
   - If `res` is not `<`, then `best` remains 0.

Therefore, the output will be:
- If `res` is `<`: `? 1 1 1 2`
- If `res` is not `<`: `? 1 0 1 2`

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both cases. However, based on the precondition, we can assume that `res` is `<` and thus `best` is set to 1.

Output: **? 1 1 1 2**
