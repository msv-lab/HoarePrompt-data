Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 4.
- `i` is 4.
- `res` is the new input provided by the user.
- If `res` is `<`, then `k` is set to 2. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`:**
   - According to the initial state, `i` is 4.

2. **Value of `k`:**
   - The value of `k` depends on the value of `res`.
   - If `res` is `<`, then `k` is set to 2.
   - If `res` is not `<`, then `k` remains unchanged. Since the initial state does not specify an initial value for `k`, we assume it is undefined or not set before this condition is checked.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement will output the following:
     - `'?'` (a string)
     - `0` (an integer)
     - `k` (the value of `k`, which could be 2 if `res` is `<`, otherwise it is undefined)
     - `0` (an integer)
     - `i` (which is 4)

### Possible Outputs:
- If `res` is `<`, then `k` is 2.
  - The output will be: `? 0 2 0 4`
- If `res` is not `<`, then `k` remains undefined.
  - The output will be: `? 0 [undefined] 0 4`

### Final Output:
Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `k` and only tells us how it changes based on `res`, we need to consider both cases:

Output: **? 0 [k] 0 4 (where k is 2 if res is '<', otherwise k is undefined)**
