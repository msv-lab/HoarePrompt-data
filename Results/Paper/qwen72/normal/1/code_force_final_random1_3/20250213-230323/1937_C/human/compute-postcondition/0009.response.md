The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 3), and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i` (which is 3).

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is the input provided by the user. If `res` is `<`, then `k` is set to 2.**
