Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters (up to 10 characters long). It checks if the string `s` contains exactly two unique characters. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then prints either the string `s` sorted in reverse alphabetical order or in alphabetical order, depending on whether `s` is already sorted in alphabetical order. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
