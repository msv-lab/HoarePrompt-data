Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new `s`.
  - If `len(a) == 2`, the set `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters.
  - Otherwise, the number of unique characters in `a` is not equal to 2.
- `b` is a string formed by sorting the characters in the new `s` alphabetically.
- `c` is a string formed by sorting the characters in the new `s` in reverse alphabetical order.
- If the new `s` is already sorted in alphabetical order, then `s` is equal to `b`.
- Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides conditions and variables but does not influence the output of the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement is independent of the variables and conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the initial state.

Output: **YES**
