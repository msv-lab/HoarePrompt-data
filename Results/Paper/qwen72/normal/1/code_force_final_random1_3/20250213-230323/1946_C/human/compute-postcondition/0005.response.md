The function `solve()` is called without any arguments. Since the function definition is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the variables or the state of the program. However, based on the context, it is likely that `solve()` performs some operations related to the tree structure defined by `n`, `k`, and `edges`.

Given that the function is called, it may modify the state of the program, but without knowing the implementation details, we can only assume that the function might return a value or modify global variables. Since no specific changes are observable from the given code snippet, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a positive integer less than `n` representing the number of edges to be removed, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(v, u)` represents an edge between vertices `v` and `u`, with `1 ≤ v, u ≤ n`.**
