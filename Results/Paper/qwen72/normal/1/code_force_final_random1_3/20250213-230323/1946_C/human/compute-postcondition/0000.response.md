The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(sys.stdin.readline())`. For the loop to execute, this value must be at least 1.

Since the state before the loop starts includes `n`, `k`, and `edges`, these variables do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, the input from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be a positive integer to ensure the loop runs at least once.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a positive integer less than `n` representing the number of edges to be removed, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(v, u)` represents an edge between vertices `v` and `u`, with `1 ≤ v, u ≤ n`, and the input from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be a positive integer.**
