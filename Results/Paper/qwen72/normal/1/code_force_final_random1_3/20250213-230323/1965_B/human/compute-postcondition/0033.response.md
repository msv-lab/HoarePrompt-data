To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop head:

```python
for i in range(lk, l):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variables `i`, `lk`, and `l`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with new values assigned by `func_7()`.
   - `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix.
   - `l` is the length of the binary string `b`.
   - `k` is not equal to 1.
   - `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.
   - `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 up to 2^(lk-2), followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and now also includes `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, `2`, and `2`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop will execute if `i` is less than `l`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `lk - 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `lk`.

4. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < l`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be `lk` and `l` must be greater than `lk`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `lk`.
- `l` must be greater than `lk` for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with new values assigned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. `k` is not equal to 1. `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 up to 2^(lk-2), followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and now also includes `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, `2`, and `2`. `i` is `lk`, `l` must be greater than `lk`.**
