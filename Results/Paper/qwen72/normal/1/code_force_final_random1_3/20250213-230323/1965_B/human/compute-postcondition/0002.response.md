The only object in the loop head is the result of `func_10()`, which determines the number of iterations. The loop can execute again if `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `func_10()` must have returned a value greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must still return a value greater than 0.

Since `_` is a placeholder variable and does not retain its value between iterations, it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, and the value returned by `func_14()` has been written to the standard output.**
