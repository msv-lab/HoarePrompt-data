The code snippet `sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')` calls the function `func_14()`, converts its return value to a string, and writes it to the standard output followed by a newline character.

Given the initial state that `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, this condition does not affect the execution of the provided code snippet since `func_14()` is called instead. The value returned by `func_14()` is not specified, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, the code will write the string representation of whatever `func_14()` returns to the standard output.

Since no variables are explicitly modified in the given code snippet, the only change is the output to the standard output. The initial state regarding `func_10()` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, and the value returned by `func_14()` has been written to the standard output.**
