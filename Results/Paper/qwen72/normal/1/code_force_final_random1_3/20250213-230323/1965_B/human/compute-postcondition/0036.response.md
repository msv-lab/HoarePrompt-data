Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with new values assigned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. If `k` is 1, `n` is not equal to 2, and `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)]`. `i` is `l-1`. If `k` is not 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 up to 2^(lk-2), followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and now also includes `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1). `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk` and must be at least 2. `i` is `l-1`.***
