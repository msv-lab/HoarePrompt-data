### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_14()` is called `t` times within `func_15()` to handle each test case.

2. **Test Case Handling:**
   - `func_14()` reads the values of `n` and `k` using `func_7()`.
   - It then constructs a sequence `ans` based on the values of `n` and `k`.

3. **Sequence Construction:**
   - If `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the function returns the string `'1\n2'`.
   - If `k == 1` and `n > 2`, the function constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{l-1}\), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - If `k != 1`, the function constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{lk-2}\), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`. It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and powers of 2 from \(2^{lk}\) to \(2^{l-1}\).

4. **Output:**
   - The function `func_14()` returns a space-separated string of the constructed sequence.
   - `func_15()` writes the result of `func_14()` to the standard output for each test case.

### Verification of Conditions:
- **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
  - The construction ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by carefully choosing the elements and their sums.
- **Subsequences Summing to All Values `v` (1 ≤ v ≤ n, v ≠ k):**
  - The sequence is constructed to include all necessary values to form subsequences that sum to all values from 1 to `n` except `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, constructs the required sequence, and outputs the results as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
