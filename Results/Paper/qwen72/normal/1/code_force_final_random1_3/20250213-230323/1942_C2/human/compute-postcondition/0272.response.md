The only object in the loop head is the variable `gap`, which is taken from the iterable `odd`. The state of `y` is affected by the loop body but is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` was decreased by `gap // 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `gap` must be available from the iterable `odd`.

State: **`y` is decreased by `gap // 2`, `gap` is the next value from `odd`**
