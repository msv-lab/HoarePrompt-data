Output State: **`x` must be at least 0, `c` is `i // 2`, `val` is sorted with even numbers first followed by odd numbers and must have at least one element, `sx` is the count of how many times `c` was equal to 1 during the loop plus `i` plus `y * 2`, `y` is now `y - c` from the previous iteration, and the values of `cons`, `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sx` is updated by adding `y * 2` to its current value.
- All other variables (`x`, `c`, `val`, `y`, `cons`, `t`, `n`, and `l`) retain their previous values or conditions.
- The new value of `sx` is the original value of `sx` plus `y * 2`.
