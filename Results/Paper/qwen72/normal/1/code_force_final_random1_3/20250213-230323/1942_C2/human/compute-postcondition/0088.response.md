The code snippet `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. This means the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the new input values.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9)
- `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5))
- `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x)
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input
- `tt` must be greater than 2
- `ii` is 2
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`
- `tmp` is a list that may contain some elements
- `ans` is incremented by `y`

After executing the code snippet, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the new input values, while the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the new second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the new third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `tt` must be greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `tmp` is a list that may contain some elements, `ans` is incremented by `y`**
