Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x). `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least `x + 2` elements. `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is `x + 1`, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[x + 1] - a[x]) // 2`. `ans` is increased by `(a[x + 1] - a[x]) // 2`.**
