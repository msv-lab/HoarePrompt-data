Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), the list of x integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input with at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`, `ans` is increased by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` updates the variable `ans` by adding the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` to it. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
