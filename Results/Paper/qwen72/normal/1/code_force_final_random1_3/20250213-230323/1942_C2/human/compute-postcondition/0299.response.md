Postcondition: ***`even` is a sorted list of all the even gaps greater than 0 and must have at least three elements, `gap` is the third element in `even`, `ans` is increased by 6, and `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, `ans` is further increased by `6 - 2 * (gap // 2)`, `y` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
