Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the first integer from the input, and for each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x`; the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, x, y = R()
    sx = 0
    l = list(R())
    l.sort()
    l.append(n + l[0])
    val = []
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
        if c == 1:
            sx += 1
        val.append(c)
    val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
    for i in val:
        c = i // 2
        if y < c:
            sx += y * 2
            break
        sx += i
        y -= c
    cons = x + sx - 2
    cons = min(n - 2, cons)
    print(cons)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `val` will have been fully processed, `i` will be the last element in `val`, `c` will be the last value of `i // 2`, `sx` will be the sum of all elements in `val` plus any additional increments due to the condition `y < c` being met, `y` will be reduced by the sum of all `c` values calculated during the loop, or it may be zero if the loop broke early due to `y < c`, `cons` will be the minimum of `n - 2` and the original value of `cons`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and the original value of `cons`; `val` remains sorted with odd numbers before even numbers; `i` is the last element in `val`; `c` is the integer division of the last `i` by 2; `sx` is the sum of all `i` values processed in the loop plus any additional increments from `y * 2` when `y < c`; `y` is the third value returned by `R()` minus the sum of all `c` values calculated during the loop, and if the loop broke early, `y` is less than the last `c` value; `t`, `n`, `x`, and `l` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `x` must be at least 0, `c` is the last calculated value of `i // 2`, `val` is sorted with even numbers first followed by odd numbers, both in ascending order, `sx` is the sum of all `i` values processed in the loop plus the count of how many times `c` was equal to 1 during the loop, `y` is the original `y` minus the sum of all `c` values calculated in the loop, `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`, and the values of `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
