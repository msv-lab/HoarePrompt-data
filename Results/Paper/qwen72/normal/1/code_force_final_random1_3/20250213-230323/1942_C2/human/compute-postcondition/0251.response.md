Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `y` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`, `i` is 2, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `x` is 3, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[3]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[2] - 1`, `ans` remains `x - 2`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` contains the value of `gap` and `odd` is an empty list. Otherwise, `even` is an empty list and `odd` may contain the value of `gap` twice if `gap` is odd.***
