Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates a value `ans` based on the gaps between the sorted list of integers and the value of `y`. The final value of `ans` is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the processed values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the sorted list of integers, with `t` being 0. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
