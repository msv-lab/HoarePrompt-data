Output State: **`y` is 0, `gap` is the next value from `odd`, `ans` is increased by 2 times the previous value of `y` (which was `y` decreased by `gap // 2`).**

Explanation:
- The variable `y` is set to 0.
- The value of `gap` remains the next value from `odd`.
- The variable `ans` is increased by 2 times the previous value of `y`, which was `y` decreased by `gap // 2`. Since `y` is now 0, the previous value of `y` (before being set to 0) is what was used to update `ans`.
