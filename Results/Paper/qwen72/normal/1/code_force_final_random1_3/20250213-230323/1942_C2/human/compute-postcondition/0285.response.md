Postcondition: ***`even` is a sorted list of all the even gaps greater than 0 and must have at least one element, `gap` is the first element in `even`. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `y` is set to 0, `ans` is increased by `2 * y`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
