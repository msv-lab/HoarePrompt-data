Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is 0 if `y < gap // 2` for any `gap` in `odd`, otherwise `y` remains as `y - sum(gap // 2 for gap in odd)`. `a` is a new list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`, and `a` is now sorted. `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`. `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the first element in `even`, `odd` is a sorted list containing all gaps greater than 1 and odd encountered during the loop, `even` is a sorted list containing all positive even gaps encountered during the loop and must have at least 1 element. `ans` is `x - 1` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` during the loop plus `sum(2 * (y - gap // 2) for gap in odd) + sum(gap for gap in odd)`, but if `y` is 0, the term `2 * (y - gap // 2)` evaluates to 0 for all `gap` in `odd`. If `y < gap // 2` for any `gap` in `odd`, the loop breaks.***
