Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the new second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the new third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, and `tmp` is an empty list. If `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)` and `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x + y - 2` and all other variables retain their original values.***
