To determine what will be printed by the `print(cons)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `cons` step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` must be at least 0.
   - `c` is the last calculated value of `i // 2`.
   - `val` is sorted with even numbers first followed by odd numbers, both in ascending order.
   - `sx` is the sum of all `i` values processed in the loop plus the count of how many times `c` was equal to 1 during the loop.
   - `y` is the original `y` minus the sum of all `c` values calculated in the loop.
   - `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.

2. **Understanding `cons`:**
   - `cons` is calculated as the minimum of two values:
     - `n - 2`
     - `x + sx - 2`

3. **Breaking Down the Components:**
   - `n` is a constant value that remains unchanged.
   - `x` is at least 0.
   - `sx` is the sum of all `i` values processed in the loop plus the count of how many times `c` was equal to 1 during the loop.
   - `x + sx - 2` is the sum of `x` and `sx` minus 2.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - `cons = min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`

Since the exact values of `n`, `x`, and `sx` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **cons (where cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2)**
