Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is `x - 1`, `tmp` is an empty list, `ans` is `x + y - 1`, and the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of the list `a` is 2.**
