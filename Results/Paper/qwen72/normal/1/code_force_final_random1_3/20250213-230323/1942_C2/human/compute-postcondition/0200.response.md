To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation of `ans` step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `x` is greater than or equal to 0.
4. `y` is 0.
5. `a` is a new list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`, and `a` is now sorted.
6. `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`.
7. `i` is `x - 1`.
8. `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`.
9. `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`.
10. `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.
11. `gap` is the last element in `even`.
12. `odd` is a sorted list containing all gaps greater than 1 and odd encountered during the loop.
13. `even` is a sorted list containing all positive even gaps encountered during the loop.
14. `ans` is computed as follows:
   - `x - 1` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` during the loop.
   - Plus `sum(2 * (y - gap // 2) for gap in odd) + sum(gap for gap in odd) + sum(even)`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation of `ans`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` is a non-negative integer.
   - `y` is 0.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`.
   - `st` is a set of unique elements from `a`.

2. **Intermediate Variables**:
   - `i` is `x - 1`.
   - `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`.
   - `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`.
   - `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.
   - `gap` is the last element in `even`.

3. **Computation of `ans`**:
   - `x - 1`: This is simply `x - 1`.
   - Number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` during the loop: This depends on the specific values of `t1` and `t2` and the contents of `st`.
   - `sum(2 * (y - gap // 2) for gap in odd) + sum(gap for gap in odd) + sum(even)`: This is the sum of two parts:
     - `sum(2 * (y - gap // 2) for gap in odd)`: Since `y` is 0, this simplifies to `sum(-gap // 2 for gap in odd)`.
     - `sum(gap for gap in odd) + sum(even)`: This is the sum of all elements in `odd` and `even`.

### Final Output:
Given the complexity and the dependencies on the specific values of `a`, `n`, and `x`, the exact numerical value of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing these values. However, the structure of the computation is clear.

Output: **ans (where ans is computed as described above, including the contributions from the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, and the sums of the gaps in odd and even lists)**.
