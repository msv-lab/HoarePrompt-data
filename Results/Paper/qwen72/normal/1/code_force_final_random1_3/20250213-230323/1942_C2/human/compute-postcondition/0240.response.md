The code snippet `odd.append(gap)` adds the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. Given the initial conditions, `gap` is determined based on the difference between `next_elem` and `a[1]` plus 1. The specific value of `gap` depends on the values of `a`, `x`, and `n`, but it is known that `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, which means `odd` will contain the value of `gap`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `y` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`, `i` is 1, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[2]` if `x` is not 2, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[1] - 1`, `ans` remains `x - 2`, `odd` is a list containing the value of `gap`, and `even` is an empty list.**
