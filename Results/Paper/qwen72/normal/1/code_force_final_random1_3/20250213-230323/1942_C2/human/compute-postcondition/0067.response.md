Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x). `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least `x + 1` elements. `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is `x`, and `tmp` is either an empty list or contains one element. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[x] - a[x - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[x] - a[x - 1]) // 2`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + (a[x] - a[x - 1]) // 2`. If neither of these conditions is met, the values of `y`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged.***
