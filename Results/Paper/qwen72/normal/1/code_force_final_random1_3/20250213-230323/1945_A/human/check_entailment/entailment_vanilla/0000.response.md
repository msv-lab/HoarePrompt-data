### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads input from `open(0)`, which is a shorthand for reading from standard input.
   - It skips the first line (which contains the number of test cases) and processes each subsequent line as a test case.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - For each test case, it splits the line into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

3. **Logic**:
   - The program adds the number of universals `c` to the number of extroverts `b`. This is because universals can be used to fill the remaining spots in the tents that extroverts need.
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` calculates the number of tents required:
     - `b // 3` gives the number of full tents needed for extroverts.
     - `-b // 3` ensures that the division is floored correctly (i.e., it handles negative numbers correctly).
     - `a + (b // 3)` gives the total number of tents needed for introverts and the full tents for extroverts.
   - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents for extroverts:
     - `b % 3` gives the remainder when `b` is divided by 3, which represents the number of additional people needed to fill the tents.
     - If `c < b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, and the program outputs `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it outputs the total number of tents required.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as when `a`, `b`, or `c` are zero.
   - It also handles large values of `a`, `b`, and `c` up to \(10^9\).

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, either the number of tents or `-1` if it's impossible to accommodate everyone.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed or outputs `-1` if it's impossible. The reasoning and implementation are sound.

Correctness: **True**
