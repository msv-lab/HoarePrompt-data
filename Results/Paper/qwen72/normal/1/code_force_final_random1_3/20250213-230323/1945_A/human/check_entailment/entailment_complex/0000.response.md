Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads from standard input, ignoring the first line which contains the number of test cases. This is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Parsing Input**: For each line, it correctly splits the line into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

3. **Logic for Tents Calculation**:
   - The line `b += c` is intended to consider universals as potential extroverts, which is a step towards calculating the minimum number of tents.
   - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is used to calculate the number of tents:
     - `a - -b // 3` is intended to calculate the number of tents needed for introverts and extroverts/universals. The `- -b // 3` part is equivalent to `b // 3` because the double negative cancels out.
     - The condition `c < b % 3` checks if there are enough universals to satisfy the remaining extroverts. If `c` is less than the remainder of `b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to form complete groups of 3 for the remaining extroverts, and thus the function should return `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `a`, `b`, and `c` are all zero, the function correctly outputs `0`.
   - When there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals, the function correctly outputs `-1`.

5. **Final State**:
   - The function retains the last values of `a`, `b`, and `c` read from the input, but this does not affect the correctness of the output since the function only prints the results and does not rely on these values outside the loop.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to handle all the specified conditions and edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
