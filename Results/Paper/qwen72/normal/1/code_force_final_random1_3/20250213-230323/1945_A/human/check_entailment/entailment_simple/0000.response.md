### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate `a` introverts, `b` extroverts, and `c` universals.
   - Introverts need their own tent.
   - Extroverts need to share a tent with exactly two others.
   - Universals can be flexible and fit into any tent configuration.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases from the standard input.
   - For each test case, it splits the input line into `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It then adds the number of universals (`c`) to the number of extroverts (`b`), effectively treating universals as potential extroverts.
   - The program then calculates the number of tents required using the formula `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`.

3. **Breaking Down the Formula:**
   - `b += c`: This step combines the number of extroverts and universals.
   - `-b // 3`: This calculates the number of full tents needed for extroverts and universals combined. The negative sign ensures that the division rounds up.
   - `a - -b // 3`: This subtracts the number of full tents needed for extroverts and universals from the number of introverts. This gives the total number of tents needed.
   - `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`: This checks if there are enough universals to satisfy the remaining extroverts. If `c < b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to complete the last tent for the extroverts, and the program returns `-1`.

4. **Checking Edge Cases:**
   - If `c` is less than `b % 3`, the program correctly returns `-1` because it's impossible to form a tent with the remaining extroverts.
   - If `c` is greater than or equal to `b % 3`, the program correctly calculates the number of tents needed.

5. **Final Verification:**
   - The program handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.
   - The logic is sound and follows the requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
