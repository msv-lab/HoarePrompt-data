The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, s.split())` updates the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the elements in the string `s` after splitting it by spaces and converting each element to an integer.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9
- `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9 and has been updated to `b + c`
- `c` is an integer between 0 and 10^9
- `s` is the next element in the list `[*open(0)][1:]`

After executing the code:
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are reassigned to the integers obtained from splitting `s` and converting them to integers.
- The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are no longer relevant.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is the first integer in `s`, `b` is the second integer in `s`, `c` is the third integer in `s`, and `s` is the next element in the list `[*open(0)][1:]`.**
