The code snippet `lst[a].append(b)` appends the integer `b` to the list located at index `a` in the list `lst`. The values of `x`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, but the list at index `a` in `lst` now includes the additional element `b`.

Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element.**
