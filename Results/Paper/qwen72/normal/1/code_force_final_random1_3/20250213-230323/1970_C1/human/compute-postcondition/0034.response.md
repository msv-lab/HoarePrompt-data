Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-2)` times, `z` is an input integer and must be equal to `b`, `tmp` is now equal to the last element of `rev[b]` before the pop operation, `one` alternates between `True` and `False` depending on the number of iterations (if the total number of iterations is odd, `one` is `False`; if even, `one` is `True`), `two` is `False`, and all lists in `lst` that were initially non-empty are now empty.**
