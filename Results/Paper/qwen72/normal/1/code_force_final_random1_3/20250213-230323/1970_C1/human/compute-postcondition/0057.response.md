Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations. `queue` is empty, indicating that there are no more nodes to process. `visited` contains all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, starting from `start`. If the `target` node was found, the function would have returned the distance (`dist`) representing the shortest path from `start` to `target`. If the `target` node was not found, the loop terminates with `queue` being empty and `visited` containing all reachable nodes from `start`.**
