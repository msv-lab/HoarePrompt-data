The function `func` does not take any parameters, but based on the problem description, it assumes the existence of a tree structure with specific properties (exactly two leaves) and a single round of the game (t=1). The tree is represented by a series of edges provided in the input, and the initial position of the stone is also given. The number of nodes `n` satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, and the edges connect nodes labeled from 1 to n. The initial node for the stone is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.
