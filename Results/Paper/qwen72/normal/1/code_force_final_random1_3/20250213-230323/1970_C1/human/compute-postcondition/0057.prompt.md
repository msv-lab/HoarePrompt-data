Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, where 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`. The tree is represented as a dictionary or adjacency list where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring node indices. `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.
Code of the loop:
while queue:
    current, dist = queue.popleft()
    if current == target:
        return dist
    for neighbor in tree[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, where 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`. `queue` is a deque that contains tuples of the form `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for each unique neighbor of `start` that was not initially in the `visited` set. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all unique neighbors of `start` that were processed. `current` is equal to `start`. `dist` is 0. `current` is not equal to `target`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The loop has processed all reachable nodes from `start` until either the `target` node is found or all possible nodes are visited. The `queue` is empty, meaning there are no more unvisited neighbors to process. The `visited` set contains all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, starting from `start`. If the `target` node was reached, the distance (`dist`) represents the shortest path from `start` to `target`. If the `target` node was not found, the loop terminates with `queue` being empty and `visited` containing all reachable nodes from `start`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: All neighbors of the current node `current` in `tree` have been processed. Each neighbor that was not in `visited` before the loop started has been added to `visited`, and a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` has been appended to `queue` for each such neighbor.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
