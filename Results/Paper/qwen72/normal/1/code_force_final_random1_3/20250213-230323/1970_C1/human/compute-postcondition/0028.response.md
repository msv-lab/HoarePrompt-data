Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is the last element of `lst[tmp]` before it was popped, `one` is `False`, `lst[z]` must not be an empty list but now has one less element, and `lst[tmp]` has two less elements but must still contain at least one element.**

Explanation:
- The line `tmp = lst[tmp].pop()` removes the last element from `lst[tmp]` and assigns this value to `tmp`.
- Since `lst[tmp]` had one element removed in the initial state, it now has two elements removed.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
