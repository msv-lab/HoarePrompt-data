Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` twice as additional elements, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element twice, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `rev[b].append(a)` adds `a` as an additional element to the list `rev[b]`. Since `rev[b]` already contained `a` once, it now contains `a` twice. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.
