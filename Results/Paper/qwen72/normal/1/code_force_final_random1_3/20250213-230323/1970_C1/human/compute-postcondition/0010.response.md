The value of `b` is appended to the list `lst[a]`. The initial state specifies that `lst[a]` already contains `b` as an additional element, so after executing the code, `b` will be appended again, making it appear twice in `lst[a]`. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` twice as additional elements, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.**
