The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, both integers representing nodes in a tree. It performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is found, it returns the distance (number of steps) from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is not found, it returns -1. The function modifies a `visited` set to keep track of the nodes that have been visited during the traversal. After the function concludes, the `visited` set contains all nodes that were reachable from the `start` node, and the `queue` is empty.
