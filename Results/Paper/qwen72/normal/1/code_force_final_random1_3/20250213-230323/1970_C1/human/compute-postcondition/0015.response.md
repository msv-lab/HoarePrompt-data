The code `rev[b].append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `rev[b]`. Since `rev[b]` already contained `a` twice, it will now contain `a` three times.

Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` three times as additional elements, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element three times, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.**
