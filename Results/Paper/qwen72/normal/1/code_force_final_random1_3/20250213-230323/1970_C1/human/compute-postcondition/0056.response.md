Output State: **All neighbors of the current node `current` in `tree` have been processed. Each neighbor that was not in `visited` before the loop started has been added to `visited`, and a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` has been appended to `queue` for each such neighbor.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop, every neighbor of the current node `current` has been checked. If a neighbor was not already in the `visited` set, it has been added to the set, and a tuple containing the neighbor and the updated distance (`dist + 1`) has been added to the `queue`. This ensures that all reachable nodes from the current node have been accounted for in the traversal process.
