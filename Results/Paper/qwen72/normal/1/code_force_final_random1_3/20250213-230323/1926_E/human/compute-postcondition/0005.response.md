Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**. 

This means that the value of `m` is calculated as the integer division of `n + 1` by 2, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `L`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
