Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values `[m1, m2, ..., mk]` where each `mi` is the value of `(ni + 1) // 2` for the corresponding iteration, and `ni` is the value of `n` at the start of each iteration, `tot` is `a`, `pow` is 2, `a` is the second element in `L`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then the postcondition remains unchanged.***
