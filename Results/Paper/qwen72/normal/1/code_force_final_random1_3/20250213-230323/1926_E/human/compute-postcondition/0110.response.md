To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

### Loop Condition:
```python
while p <= i - 1:
```

### Current State:
- `n` and `k` are input integers and both must be greater than 0.
- `s` is the sum of the series of values calculated by `(d + 1) // 2` until `d` becomes 0 or `s` reaches or exceeds `k`.
- `i` must be at least 3.
- `d` is 0 or a value such that adding `(d + 1) // 2` to `s` would make `s` exceed `k`.
- `h` is now `h - (h + 1) // 2`.
- `p` is now 3.
- `g` is now `g + (h + 1) // 2`.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition depends on `p` and `i`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`.

### Current Values:
- `p` is 3.
- `i` must be at least 3.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`.
- Since `p` is 3, `i - 1` must be at least 3, which means `i` must be at least 4.

### Conclusion:
- The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `i` is at least 4.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are input integers and both must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of the series of values calculated by `(d + 1) // 2` until `d` becomes 0 or `s` reaches or exceeds `k`, `i` must be at least 4, `d` is 0 or a value such that adding `(d + 1) // 2` to `s` would make `s` exceed `k`, `h` is now `h - (h + 1) // 2`, `p` is now 3, `g` is now `g + (h + 1) // 2`**
