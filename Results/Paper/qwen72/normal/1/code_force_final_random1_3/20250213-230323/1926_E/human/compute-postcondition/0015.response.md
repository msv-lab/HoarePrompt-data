Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2 - m`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing three elements `[m, m, m]`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2` (where `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`).**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `L` is a list containing two elements `[m, m]`.
- The code `L.append(m)` adds another element `m` to the list `L`.
- After executing the code, `L` now contains three elements `[m, m, m]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
