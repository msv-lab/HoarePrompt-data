Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `n_input` and `n_input` must be greater than 0, `k` is `k_input`, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `a` is undefined because `L` is empty, `m` is `(n_input + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `(n_input + 1) // 2` since `n` is `n_input`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
