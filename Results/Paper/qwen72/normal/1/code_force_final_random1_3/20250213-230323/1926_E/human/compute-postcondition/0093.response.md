Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `L` is a list containing the values `(n_initial + 1) // 2`, `((n_initial // 2 + 1) // 2)`, ..., until `n` becomes 0, `L` must have at least one element, `a` is the first element in `L`, `tot` is `a`, `pow` is 1, `m` is the last value calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the current conditions remain unchanged.** 

Explanation: The value of `tot` is updated by adding the value of `a` to it. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The new value of `tot` is now equal to the value of `a`.
