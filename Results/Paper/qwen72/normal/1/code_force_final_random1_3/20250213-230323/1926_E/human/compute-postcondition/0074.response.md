The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is the first integer input by the user. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be non-zero.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be non-zero, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `L` is an empty list, `a` is undefined, `tot` is undefined, `pow` is undefined.**
