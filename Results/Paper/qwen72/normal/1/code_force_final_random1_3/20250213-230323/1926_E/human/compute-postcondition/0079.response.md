Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be non-zero, but after the last iteration, `n` must still be greater than 0, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `L` is a list containing the value `(n + 1) // 2`, `a` is undefined, `tot` is undefined, `pow` is undefined, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n - ((n + 1) // 2)` and must be greater than 0, `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
