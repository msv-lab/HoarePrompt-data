Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `n_input - ((n_input + 1) // 2)`, `k` is `k_input`, `L` is `[m]`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `a` is undefined because `L` is now `[m]`, `m` is `((n_input - ((n_input + 1) // 2)) + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated to `((n + 1) // 2)`.
- Since `n` is defined as `n_input - ((n_input + 1) // 2)`, substituting this into the new expression for `m` gives `m` as `((n_input - ((n_input + 1) // 2)) + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `tot`, `pow`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
