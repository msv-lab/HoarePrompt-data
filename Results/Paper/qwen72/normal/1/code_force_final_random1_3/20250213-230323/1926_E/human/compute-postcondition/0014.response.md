Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2 - m`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing two elements `[m, m]`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2` (where `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`).**

Explanation:
- `t` remains unchanged and must be greater than 0.
- `n` was initially `n - (n + 1) // 2`. After the code `n -= m`, `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2 - m`.
- `k` remains an input integer.
- `L` remains a list containing two elements `[m, m]`.
- `m` remains `(n + 1) // 2`, where `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
