Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are input integers and both must be greater than 0.
- `s` is the sum of the series of values calculated by `(d + 1) // 2` until `d` becomes 0 or `s` reaches or exceeds `k`.
- `i` is the total number of iterations the loop ran.
- `d` is 0 or a value such that adding `(d + 1) // 2` to `s` would make `s` exceed `k`.
- `h` is 0.
- `p` is `i`.
- `g` is the sum of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration of the loop.
- `f` is `k - g`.
- `y` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(y)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `y` is explicitly defined as 2 in the initial state.
- The `print(y)` statement will simply print the value of `y`.

### Output:
Output: **2**
