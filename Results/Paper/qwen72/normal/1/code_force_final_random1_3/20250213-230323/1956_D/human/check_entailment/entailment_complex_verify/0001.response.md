### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` using the MEX operation.
   - The MEX operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum with no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function handles the MEX operation on a subarray from `l` to `r`.
     - If `l == r`, it checks if the single element is not zero and sets it to zero if necessary.
     - Otherwise, it recursively processes the subarray from `l+1` to `r`.
     - If the current element `a[l]` is not equal to the length of the subarray, it performs the MEX operation and updates the subarray.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function initializes the operations list and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array.
     - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

   - **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`):**
     - This function recursively maximizes the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
     - It calculates the sum of the subarray and compares it to the maximum possible sum `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
     - If the current sum is less than or equal to the maximum possible sum, it applies the MEX operation and updates the subarray.
     - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the left and right subarrays around this maximum element.

   - **Function 4 (`func_3`):**
     - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the sum, number of operations, and the operations themselves.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The functions seem to follow the logic required to maximize the sum of the array using the MEX operation.
   - The recursive approach in `recursive_maximize_sum` ensures that the subarrays are processed correctly.
   - The base cases and recursive calls in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` are handled appropriately.
   - The operations are stored and printed correctly in `func_3`.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `a` and `ops` parameters, which might lead to issues.
   - However, in the context of the provided code, `a` and `ops` are global variables, so they are accessible within the functions without being explicitly passed.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Despite the potential issue with parameter passing, the overall logic and structure of the functions appear to be correct for solving the problem as described.
   - The use of global variables for `a` and `ops` in the provided code allows the functions to work correctly, even though it is generally not a best practice.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The program is correct as it stands. The functions `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` correctly handle the MEX operation and the recursive processing of subarrays. The use of global variables for `a` and `ops` ensures that the functions can access and modify these variables as needed. While passing `a` and `ops` explicitly would be a better practice, the current implementation works correctly for the given problem.
