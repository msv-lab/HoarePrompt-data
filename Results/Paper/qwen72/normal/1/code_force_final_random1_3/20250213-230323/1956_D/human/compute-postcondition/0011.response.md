The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. The function returns a result based on the input parameters.

Since the specific output conditions are not provided, I will assume the function processes the list `a` in some way and returns a result. However, without more details on the output, I can only describe the parameters and the general expectation that the function will return a result based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18) and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). It processes the list `a` and returns a result based on the input parameters.**
