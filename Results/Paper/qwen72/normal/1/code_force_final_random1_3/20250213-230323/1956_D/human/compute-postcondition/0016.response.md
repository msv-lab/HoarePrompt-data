The function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` is called with the parameters `l` and `pos - 1`. This function call will affect the state of the program, particularly the values of `l` and potentially other variables depending on what the function does internally. However, since the function's implementation is not provided, we can only infer the immediate impact of the function call.

Given the initial state:
- `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`.
- `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
- `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`.
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`.
- `pos` is not equal to `l`.

After calling `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)`, the function will likely modify the state of the program, but without the function's definition, we cannot determine the exact changes. However, we can infer that the function call itself does not change the initial state variables directly, but it may cause side effects or return values that could affect the state.

Since the function call is made, we should note that the function has been called with the specified parameters, and we assume that the function will handle the logic internally.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`, `pos` is not equal to `l`, and `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called.**
