To determine what will be printed by the `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 18\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) is provided by the input and satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
- `s` is the first value returned by `func_2(a)`.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2(a)`.
- `ops` is a non-empty list of pairs returned by `func_2(a)`.

### Analysis:
- The `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement suggests that `l` and `r` are indices or values that are part of the pairs in the `ops` list.
- Since `ops` is a list of pairs, each pair likely represents a range or a segment of the list `a`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Understanding `ops`**:
   - `ops` is a list of pairs, and each pair `(l, r)` represents a range in the list `a`.
   - The indices `l` and `r` are 0-based, meaning they start from 0.

2. **Adjusting Indices**:
   - The `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement increments both `l` and `r` by 1.
   - This adjustment converts the 0-based indices to 1-based indices.

3. **Output**:
   - The output will be the 1-based indices of the first pair in the `ops` list.
   - If `ops` contains multiple pairs, the first pair will be used for the print statement.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the context, the `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement will print the 1-based indices of the first pair in the `ops` list.

Output: **(l + 1, r + 1) (where l and r are the 0-based indices of the first pair in the ops list)**
