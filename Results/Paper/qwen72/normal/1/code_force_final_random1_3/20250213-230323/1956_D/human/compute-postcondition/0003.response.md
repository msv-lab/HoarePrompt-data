To determine what will be printed by the `print(s, m)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the function call step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 18\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) is provided by the input and satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by the function `func_2(a)`, where:
  - `s` is the first value returned.
  - `m` is the second value returned.
  - `ops` is the third value returned.

### Function Call:
The function `func_2(a)` is called with the list `a` as its argument. The function returns three values: `s`, `m`, and `ops`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement `print(s, m)` will print the values of `s` and `m`.

### Analysis:
- Since the exact implementation of `func_2(a)` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `s` and `m`.
- However, based on the context, we can infer that:
  - `s` is likely some computed value derived from the list `a`.
  - `m` is another computed value derived from the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
Without the specific implementation details of `func_2(a)`, we can only describe the output in terms of the values returned by the function.

Output: **s, m (where s and m are the first and second values returned by func_2(a), respectively)**
