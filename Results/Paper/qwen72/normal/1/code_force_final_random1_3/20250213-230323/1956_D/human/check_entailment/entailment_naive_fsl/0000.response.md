Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided solution has a logical issue in the `func_2` function. Specifically, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list, which is required by the `func_1` function. This will result in a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined within the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

Additionally, the logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` is flawed. The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):` is not sufficient to ensure that the MEX operation is applied correctly. The MEX operation should be applied to the segment `[l, r]` to maximize the sum, but the current logic does not guarantee that the MEX value is correctly computed and applied.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
Input:
3
1 2 3
```
The expected output should be:
```
6 0
```
However, the provided code will not handle this case correctly because the MEX operation is not applied in a way that maximizes the sum.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to these issues.
