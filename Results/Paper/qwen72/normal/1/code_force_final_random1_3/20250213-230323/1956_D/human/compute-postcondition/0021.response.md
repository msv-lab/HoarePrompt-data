Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`, `a` is a list of integers, and `s` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`. If `s` is less than or equal to the square of the length of the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, then each element from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) in `a` is set to `r - l + 1`, `s` may no longer be the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, and the tuple `(l, r)` is appended to the list `ops`. If `s` is greater than the square of the length of the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, then `s` remains the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, a recursive call to `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been initiated. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, a recursive call to `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called.***
