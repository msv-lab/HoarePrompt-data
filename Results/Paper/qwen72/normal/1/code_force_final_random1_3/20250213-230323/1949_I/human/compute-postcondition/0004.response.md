Output State: **n is an input integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of None values of length n, y is a list of None values of length n, r is a list of None values of length n, visited is a list of False values of length n, coef is a list of None values of length n.**

Explanation: The code `visited = [False] * n` reassigns the `visited` list to a new list of `False` values of length `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
