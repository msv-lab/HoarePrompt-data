The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `x[1]` is the first integer from the new input, `y[1]` is the second integer from the new input, `r[1]` is the third integer from the new input, `x[0]` is the first integer from the initial input, `y[0]` is the second integer from the initial input, `r[0]` is the third integer from the initial input, the rest of `x`, `y`, and `r` are None, `visited` is a list of False values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of None values of length `n`**
