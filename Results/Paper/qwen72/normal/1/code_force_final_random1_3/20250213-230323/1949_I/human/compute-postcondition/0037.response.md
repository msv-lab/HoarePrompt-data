Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of integers, `y` is a list of integers, `r` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list where the element at index 0 is True if it was initially False, otherwise it remains unchanged, the element at index 1 is True if it was initially False, otherwise it remains unchanged, and the element at index 2 is True if `visited[2]` was initially False, otherwise it remains unchanged, `coef` is a list where the element at index 0 is 1 if `visited[0]` was initially False, otherwise it remains None, the element at index 1 is 1 if `visited[1]` was initially False, otherwise it remains None, and the element at index 2 is 1 if `visited[2]` was initially False, otherwise it remains None, `tot` is 1 if `visited[2]` was initially False, otherwise it remains 0, `bipartite` is True if `visited[2]` was initially False, otherwise it remains True, `ok` is True if either its original value was True or if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains False.***
