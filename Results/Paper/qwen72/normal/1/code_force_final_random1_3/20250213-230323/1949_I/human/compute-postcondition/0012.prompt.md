Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an input integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of None values of length n, y is a list of None values of length n, r is a list of None values of length n, visited is a list of False values of length n, coef is a list of None values of length n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `x` is a list where `x[0]` is the first integer from the input and the rest are None, `y` is a list where `y[0]` is the second integer from the input and the rest are None, `r` is a list where `r[0]` is the third integer from the input and the rest are None, `visited` is a list of False values of length n, `coef` is a list of None values of length n.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 1, `x[1]` is the first integer from the new input, `y[1]` is the second integer from the new input, `r[1]` is the third integer from the new input, `x[0]` is the first integer from the initial input, `y[0]` is the second integer from the initial input, `r[0]` is the third integer from the initial input, the rest of `x`, `y`, and `r` are None, `visited` is a list of False values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of None values of length `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `x[1]` is the first integer from the new input, `y[1]` is the second integer from the new input, `r[1]` is the third integer from the new input, `x[0]` is the first integer from the initial input, `y[0]` is the second integer from the initial input, `r[0]` is the third integer from the initial input, `x[2]` is the first integer from the latest input, `y[2]` is the second integer from the latest input, `r[2]` is the third integer from the latest input, the rest of `x`, `y`, and `r` are None, `visited` is a list of False values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of None values of length `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
