Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `x` is a list where each element `x[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the first integer from the corresponding input line, `y` is a list where each element `y[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the second integer from the corresponding input line, `r` is a list where each element `r[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the third integer from the corresponding input line, `visited` is a list of False values of length `n`, `coef` is a list where the element at index `0` is 1 and the rest are None, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is True, `ok` is False, and the element at index `i` in the `visited` list is False.**

Explanation: The code snippet `tot = 0` initializes the variable `tot` to 0. Since `tot` was already 0 in the initial state, there is no change in the value of `tot`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
