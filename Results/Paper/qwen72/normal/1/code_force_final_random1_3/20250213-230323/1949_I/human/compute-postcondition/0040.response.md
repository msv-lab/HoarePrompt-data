Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element corresponds to the first, second, and third integers from the corresponding input line, respectively.
- `visited` is a list where each element is True if it was initially False, otherwise it remains unchanged.
- `coef` is a list where each element is 1 if the corresponding `visited` element was initially False, otherwise it remains None.
- `tot` is the total number of nodes processed in the last iteration where `bipartite` was True and `tot` was not 0.
- `bipartite` is True if the graph is bipartite, otherwise it is False.
- `ok` is True, indicating that the graph is bipartite and there was at least one node processed.

Given the `print('YES')` statement, the output will be:

Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string 'YES'.
- The value of `ok` is True, which indicates that the graph is bipartite and there was at least one node processed.
- Since `ok` is True, the condition for printing 'YES' is satisfied, and thus the output will be 'YES'.
