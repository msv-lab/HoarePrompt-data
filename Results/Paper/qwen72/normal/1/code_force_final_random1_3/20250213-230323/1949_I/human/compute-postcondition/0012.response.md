Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list where each element `x[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the first integer from the corresponding input line, `y` is a list where each element `y[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the second integer from the corresponding input line, `r` is a list where each element `r[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the third integer from the corresponding input line, `visited` is a list of False values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of None values of length `n`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1` (the last index of the lists). The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` will each contain `n` integers, where each set of three integers corresponds to the input provided for each iteration of the loop. The lists `visited` and `coef` remain unchanged, with `visited` still being a list of `False` values and `coef` still being a list of `None` values, both of length `n`.
