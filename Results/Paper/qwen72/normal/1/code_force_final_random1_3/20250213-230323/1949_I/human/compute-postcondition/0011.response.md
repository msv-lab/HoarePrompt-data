The provided Python code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the elements at index `i` (which is 2) of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r`. Given the initial state, let's determine the output state:

- `n` remains an input integer between 1 and 1000.
- `i` remains 2.
- `x[1]` remains the first integer from the new input.
- `y[1]` remains the second integer from the new input.
- `r[1]` remains the third integer from the new input.
- `x[0]` remains the first integer from the initial input.
- `y[0]` remains the second integer from the initial input.
- `r[0]` remains the third integer from the initial input.
- The rest of `x`, `y`, and `r` remain None except for the updated indices.
- `visited` remains a list of False values of length `n`.
- `coef` remains a list of None values of length `n`.

After executing the code snippet, the elements at index 2 of `x`, `y`, and `r` are updated with the new input values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `x[1]` is the first integer from the new input, `y[1]` is the second integer from the new input, `r[1]` is the third integer from the new input, `x[0]` is the first integer from the initial input, `y[0]` is the second integer from the initial input, `r[0]` is the third integer from the initial input, `x[2]` is the first integer from the latest input, `y[2]` is the second integer from the latest input, `r[2]` is the third integer from the latest input, the rest of `x`, `y`, and `r` are None, `visited` is a list of False values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of None values of length `n`.**
