Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list where each element `x[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the first integer from the corresponding input line, `y` is a list where each element `y[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the second integer from the corresponding input line, `r` is a list where each element `r[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the third integer from the corresponding input line, `visited` is a list where each element is True if it was initially False, otherwise it remains unchanged, `coef` is a list where each element is 1 if the corresponding `visited` element was initially False, otherwise it remains None, `tot` is the total number of nodes processed in the last iteration where `bipartite` was True and `tot` was not 0, `bipartite` is True if the graph is bipartite, otherwise it is False, `ok` is True, indicating that the graph is bipartite and there was at least one node processed.**
