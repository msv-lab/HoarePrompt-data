Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers derived from the user input and must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where `res[0]` is now `mex - ar[0]`, `mex` is `n - ar[-1]` if `ar[-1] > 0`, `i` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` updates the first element of the list `res` (since `i` is 0) to be `mex - ar[0]`.
- The value of `mex` is defined as `n - ar[-1]` if `ar[-1] > 0`.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `mex`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
- The updated state reflects that `res[0]` is now `mex - ar[0]`.
