The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user through the `input()` function. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, `mex` is the smallest value among `t - ar[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`.**
