The code snippet `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `ar`. This changes the value of `ar` from its initial state.

Let's analyze the impact on the program:

- The initial state specifies that `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element. After executing the code, `ar` will be a new list of integers derived from the user input.
- The values of `_`, `t`, `n`, `res`, `mex`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers derived from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]` starting from the last element to the first, `mex` is the result of subtracting all elements of `ar` from `n` (i.e., `n - sum(ar)`), and `i` is -1.**
