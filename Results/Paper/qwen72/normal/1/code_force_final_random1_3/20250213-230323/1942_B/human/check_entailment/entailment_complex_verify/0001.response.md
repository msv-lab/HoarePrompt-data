Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires reconstructing a permutation `p` from the array `a`, where each element of `a` is defined as \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The MEX function returns the smallest non-negative integer not present in the prefix of the permutation up to index `i`.

2. **Reversing the Process**: To find `p`, we need to reverse the process of constructing `a`. Given \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \), we can rearrange this to find \( p_i \):
   \[
   p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i
   \]

3. **Initialization**: The program initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for MEX when considering the entire permutation. This is because initially, all numbers from 0 to n-1 are potential candidates for MEX.

4. **Backward Construction**: The program iterates from the last element of `ar` to the first. For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates \( p_i \) using the formula \( p_i = mex - ar[i] \). It then updates `mex` to the newly calculated \( p_i \) if it is smaller than the current `mex`.

5. **Output**: After constructing the permutation `res`, it prints the elements of `res`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the constraints well, including the possibility of multiple valid permutations. Since the problem guarantees at least one valid permutation, the program should always produce a valid result.

7. **Efficiency**: The program uses a single pass through the array `ar` and performs constant-time operations for each element, making it efficient with a time complexity of \( O(n) \).

8. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The initialization of `mex` to `n` is correct because initially, the MEX of the empty set is `n`.
   - The backward iteration ensures that the MEX is correctly updated as we move through the array.
   - The condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]` ensures that `mex` is updated only if the new value is smaller, which is consistent with the definition of MEX.

Given the above reasoning and the annotated code analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Final: **True**
