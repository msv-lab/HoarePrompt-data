The code snippet `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `ar`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 1
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`
- `mex` is the smallest value among `t - ar[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`

After executing the code snippet:
- The variable `ar` is updated to the list of integers provided by the user.
- The values of `_`, `t`, `n`, `res`, and `mex` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, `mex` is the smallest value among `t - ar[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`.**
