The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `ar`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `ar`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `_` is 0,
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4,
- `n` is equal to `t`,
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element,
- `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None`,
- `i` is `len(ar) - 2`,
- `res[i + 1]` is `t - ar[len(ar) - 1]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, and `ar` must still have at least one more element to process. Since `i` is currently `len(ar) - 2`, decrementing `i` by 1 makes it `len(ar) - 3`. For the loop to continue, `ar` must have at least `len(ar) - 2 + 1 = len(ar) - 1` elements.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `res[i + 1]` is `t - ar[len(ar) - 1]`.**
