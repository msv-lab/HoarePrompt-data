Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`, `mex` is now equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The variable `mex` was initially defined as the smallest value among `t - ar[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`. However, the code snippet sets `mex` to `n`, which is an input integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
