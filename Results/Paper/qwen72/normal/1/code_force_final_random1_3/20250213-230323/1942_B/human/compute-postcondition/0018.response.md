Output State: **_ is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, `mex` is the smallest value among `t - ar[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0.
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the given range.
- The variable `n` remains equal to `t`.
- The list `ar` remains the same as provided by the user.
- The list `res` is now populated with the result of `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`.
- The variable `mex` is updated to the smallest value among `t - ar[i]` for all indices `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`. This is because the loop updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, which effectively reduces `mex` to the smallest possible value encountered during the loop.
