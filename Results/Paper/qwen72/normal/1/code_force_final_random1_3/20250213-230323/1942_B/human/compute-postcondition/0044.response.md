The code snippet `mex = n` assigns the value of `n` to `mex`. This changes the value of `mex` from its previous value, which was `n - sum(ar)`, to simply `n`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

- `_` is 2
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers derived from the user input
- `res` is a list of `n` elements all set to `None`
- `mex` is now equal to `n`
- `i` is -1

Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers derived from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements all set to `None`, `mex` is `n`, `i` is -1**
