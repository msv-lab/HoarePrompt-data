Reasoning:  
The provided solution iterates through the array `ar` in reverse order, constructing the permutation `res` based on the formula `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`. The variable `mex` is initially set to `n`, and it is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if this value is less than the current `mex`. This approach ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation up to the current index.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic of updating `mex`. Specifically, the condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]:` is redundant because `mex - ar[i]` will always be less than or equal to `mex` (since `ar[i]` is a non-negative integer). Therefore, the update `mex = mex - ar[i]` should always be performed without the conditional check.

Despite this redundancy, the core logic of the program is correct in terms of constructing the permutation `res` based on the given constraints and the definition of MEX. The program correctly handles the construction of the permutation and prints the result for each test case.

Given the problem's constraints and the provided execution summary, the program appears to work as intended and produces valid permutations for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
