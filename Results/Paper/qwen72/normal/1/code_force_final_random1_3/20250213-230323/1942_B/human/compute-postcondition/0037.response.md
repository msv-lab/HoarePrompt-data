Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None` except for the last element which is `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]` and the element at index `len(ar) - 3` which is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`. If `mex > mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[len(ar) - 1] - ar[len(ar) - 2] - ar[len(ar) - 3]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains as `n - ar[len(ar) - 1] - ar[len(ar) - 2]`. `i` is `len(ar) - 3`.**
