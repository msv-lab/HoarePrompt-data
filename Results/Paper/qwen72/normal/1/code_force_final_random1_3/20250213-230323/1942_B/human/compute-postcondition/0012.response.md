The value of `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `mex` was previously defined as `mex - ar[i]` or potentially updated to `t - ar[len(ar) - 1]` if the condition `mex > mex - ar[i + 1]` was true, the new value of `mex` is now `mex - ar[i]`.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `res[i + 1]` is `t - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`.**
