Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None` except for the last element which is `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]` and the element at index `len(ar) - 3` which is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `mex` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 1] - ar[len(ar) - 2] - ar[len(ar) - 3]` if `mex > mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` else `n - ar[len(ar) - 1] - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.
- Since `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, the new value of `mex` becomes `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`.
- The condition `if mex > mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` remains unchanged, so the final value of `mex` depends on whether the original `mex` was greater than `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
