Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers derived from the user input and must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where `res[-1]` is now `mex - ar[-1]`, `mex` is `n`, `i` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The code `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` updates the last element of the list `res` (since `i` is -1) to be the value of `mex - ar[-1]`.
- The value of `mex` is `n`, and `ar[-1]` is the last element of the list `ar`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
