Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. The key issue lies in how the MEX value is updated and used to construct the permutation. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **MEX Calculation and Update**: The MEX (Minimum EXcluded value) of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the sequence. The program attempts to update the MEX value by subtracting `ar[i]` from `mex`, but this approach is flawed because it does not correctly reflect the MEX of the current prefix of the permutation.

2. **Backward Construction**: The program constructs the permutation from the end to the beginning. While this approach can work, the MEX value must be correctly maintained and updated to ensure that the permutation is valid.

3. **Incorrect MEX Handling**: The condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]:` is always true because `mex - ar[i]` is always less than or equal to `mex`. This means the MEX value is always updated, which can lead to incorrect values being assigned to the permutation.

To fix the program, a more robust approach is needed to correctly maintain and update the MEX value while constructing the permutation. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        seen = set()
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex + ar[i]
            seen.add(res[i])
            while mex in seen:
                mex += 1
        
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**: Initialize an empty set `seen` to keep track of the numbers that have been used in the permutation and a variable `mex` to store the current MEX value.
2. **Backward Construction**: Iterate from the end of the array `ar` to the beginning.
3. **Calculate Permutation Value**: For each index `i`, calculate the value of `res[i]` as `mex + ar[i]`.
4. **Update Seen Set**: Add the calculated value to the `seen` set.
5. **Update MEX**: Increment the MEX value until it is no longer in the `seen` set.
6. **Output**: Print the constructed permutation.

This corrected approach ensures that the MEX value is correctly maintained and the permutation is constructed according to the given constraints.
