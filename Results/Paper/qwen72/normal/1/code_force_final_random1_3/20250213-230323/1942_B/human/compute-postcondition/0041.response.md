Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]` starting from the last element to the first, `mex` is the result of subtracting all elements of `ar` from `n` (i.e., `n - sum(ar)`), and `i` is -1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to an integer provided by the user. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The new value of `n` is now an input integer, and the rest of the variables retain their original properties and values.
