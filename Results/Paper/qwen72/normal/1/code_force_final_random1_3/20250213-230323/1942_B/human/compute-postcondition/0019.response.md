To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is equal to `t`.
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`.
- `mex` is the smallest value among `t - ar[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `mex`:**
   - `mex` is defined as the smallest value among `t - ar[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`.
   - This means `mex` is the minimum value of the list `[t - ar[i] for i in range(len(ar))]`.

2. **Construct `res`:**
   - `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`.
   - Since `n` is equal to `t`, `res` will have `t` elements.
   - Each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Print `res`:**
   - The code snippet `print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))` will print the elements of `res` separated by spaces.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume an example to illustrate the process:
- Suppose `t = 5` and `ar = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- Calculate `mex`:
  - `t - ar[0] = 5 - 1 = 4`
  - `t - ar[1] = 5 - 2 = 3`
  - `t - ar[2] = 5 - 3 = 2`
  - `t - ar[3] = 5 - 4 = 1`
  - `t - ar[4] = 5 - 5 = 0`
  - The smallest value among these is `0`, so `mex = 0`.

- Construct `res`:
  - `res[0] = mex - ar[0] = 0 - 1 = -1`
  - `res[1] = mex - ar[1] = 0 - 2 = -2`
  - `res[2] = mex - ar[2] = 0 - 3 = -3`
  - `res[3] = mex - ar[3] = 0 - 4 = -4`
  - `res[4] = mex - ar[4] = 0 - 5 = -5`
  - Therefore, `res = [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]`.

- Print `res`:
  - The output will be `-1 -2 -3 -4 -5`.

### General Output:
Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be the elements of the list `res` separated by spaces. Each element of `res` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`, where `mex` is the smallest value among `t - ar[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`.

Output: **' '.join(str(mex - ar[i]) for i in range(len(ar))) (where mex is the smallest value among t - ar[i] for all i from 0 to len(ar) - 1)**
