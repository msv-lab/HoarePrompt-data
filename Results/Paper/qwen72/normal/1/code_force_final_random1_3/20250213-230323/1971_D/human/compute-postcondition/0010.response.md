Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 0, `s` is a binary string of length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is updated to a new input binary string, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, `j` is 0, and the first two characters of `s` are different (i.e., `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1').**
