Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `j` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1, `count` is the total number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `s` plus 1, and `flag` is True because there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in the string `s`.**
