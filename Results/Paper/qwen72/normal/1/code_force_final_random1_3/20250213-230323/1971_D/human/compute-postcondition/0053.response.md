Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 1, `s` is a new input binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `j` is 3, `count` is 2 if the first character of `s` is the same as the second character of `s`, otherwise `count` is 3 if the third character of `s` is different from the fourth character of `s`, otherwise `count` is 4, `flag` is True if the third character of `s` is '0' and the fourth character of `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False, and `len(s)` must be greater than 3.***
