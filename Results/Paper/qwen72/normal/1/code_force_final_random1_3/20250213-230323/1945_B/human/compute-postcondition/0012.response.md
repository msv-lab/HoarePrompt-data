Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is the first integer input by the user.
- `b` is the second integer input by the user.
- `m` is the third integer input by the user.
- `mn` is the value of `min(a, b) + m`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `mn`**:
   - `mn` is calculated as `min(a, b) + m`.
   - `min(a, b)` gives the smaller of the two integers `a` and `b`.
   - Adding `m` to this minimum value gives `mn`.

2. **Calculate the Expression**:
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `mn // a + mn // b + 1`.
   - `mn // a` performs integer division of `mn` by `a`.
   - `mn // b` performs integer division of `mn` by `b`.
   - The results of these two divisions are added together.
   - Finally, 1 is added to the sum of these two results.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume some example values to illustrate the calculation:
- Suppose `a = 5`, `b = 3`, and `m = 7`.
  - `min(a, b) = min(5, 3) = 3`.
  - `mn = 3 + 7 = 10`.
  - `mn // a = 10 // 5 = 2`.
  - `mn // b = 10 // 3 = 3`.
  - The expression becomes `2 + 3 + 1 = 6`.

### General Output:
Given the initial state and the formula, the output will be the result of the expression `mn // a + mn // b + 1`.

Output: **mn // a + mn // b + 1 (where mn is the value of min(a, b) + m, a is the first integer input, b is the second integer input, and m is the third integer input)**
