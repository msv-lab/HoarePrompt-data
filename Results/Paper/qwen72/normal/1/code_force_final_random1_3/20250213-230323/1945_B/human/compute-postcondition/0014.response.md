Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer input by the user, `b` is the second integer input by the user, `m` is the third integer input by the user, and `mn` is the value of `min(a, b) + m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` equals 1, the program behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as specified in the else part, maintaining the same values for `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `mn`.***
