The value of `t` is assigned the integer value entered by the user through the `input()` function, which is expected to be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18.**
