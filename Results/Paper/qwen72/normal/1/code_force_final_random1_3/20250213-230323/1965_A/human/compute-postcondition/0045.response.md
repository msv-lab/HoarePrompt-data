Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`.**

Explanation:
- The code `lis = sorted(set(l))` converts the map object `l` into a set to remove duplicates and then sorts the resulting set to create a new list `lis`.
- The initial state variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- The new variable `lis` is now a sorted list of unique integers from the map object `l`.
- No further changes are made to the initial state variables, and the conditions regarding `1` in `lis` and the behavior of `test` are not evaluated by this code snippet.
