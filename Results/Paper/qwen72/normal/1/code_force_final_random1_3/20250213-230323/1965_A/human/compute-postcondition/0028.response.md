The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. The function evaluates the game state based on the contents of `arr` and returns one of two possible outcomes:

- **Case_1**: The function returns 'Alice'.
- **Case_2**: The function returns 'Alice' if a specific condition (`A`) is met during the evaluation, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. The condition `A` is met if the loop breaks before completing, indicating that a certain game rule was satisfied. If the loop completes without breaking, `A` remains `False`. Additionally, if no two consecutive elements in a set derived from `arr` have a difference greater than 1 (`not_c` is `True`), then `A` remains `False` unless the loop breaks.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of positive integers and returns 'Alice' if a specific condition is met during the evaluation or if the loop breaks early. Otherwise, it returns 'Bob'.**
