The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and the list `lis`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `lis` and the value of `j`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `len(lis)` must be greater than `j`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3, and `lis` must have at least 4 elements.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 4 elements, `j` is 3. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, `test` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `test` remains True.**
