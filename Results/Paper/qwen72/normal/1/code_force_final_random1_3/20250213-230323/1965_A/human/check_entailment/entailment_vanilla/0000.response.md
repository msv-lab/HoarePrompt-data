### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one. This is done correctly using a while loop that runs `t` times.

2. **Reading Input for Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes `arr`. This is also handled correctly.

3. **Function Call**: The program calls a function `func_1` with the list of pile sizes `arr` and prints the result. This is the correct approach to modularize the logic.

4. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` starts by initializing a boolean variable `A` to `False`.
   - It checks if the first element of the array `arr` is not 1. If it is not 1, it immediately returns 'Alice'. This is incorrect because the first element being 1 does not necessarily mean Bob wins. The game logic is more complex than this.
   - It then creates a set of unique elements from `arr`, sorts it, and iterates through the sorted set to check if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1. If it finds such a difference, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - It toggles the value of `A` for each element in the sorted set.
   - If `not_c` is still `True` after the loop, it toggles `A` one more time.
   - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True`, otherwise 'Bob'.

5. **Logical Errors**:
   - The condition `if arr[0] != 1:` is incorrect. The game logic should consider the entire array, not just the first element.
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted set is flawed. The game is about removing the same number of stones from all non-empty piles, and the winner is determined by the parity of the number of moves.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach to determine the winner is to use the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program has logical errors in determining the winner of the game. The correct approach involves calculating the Nim-sum of the pile sizes to determine the winner.
