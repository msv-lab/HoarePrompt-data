Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 3 elements, `j` is 2. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, `test` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `test` remains True.***
