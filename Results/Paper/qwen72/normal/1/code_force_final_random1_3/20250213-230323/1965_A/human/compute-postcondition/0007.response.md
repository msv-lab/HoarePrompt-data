To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive.
- `A` is `False`.
- `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr`, including the number 1.
- `not_c` is `True`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(set_)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the length of `set_`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `len(set_)` is greater than 1. This is because `range(1, len(set_))` will generate values for `i` starting from 1 up to `len(set_) - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` should start at 1.
- **`len(set_)`**: For the loop to execute, `len(set_)` must be greater than 1.

### Conclusion:
The state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `len(set_)` is greater than 1, and `i` starts at 1.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive; `A` is `False`; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr`, including the number 1, and `len(set_)` must be greater than 1; `not_c` is `True`; `i` is 1**.
