The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `lis`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `lis`. The loop will execute if `len(lis)` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `len(lis) - 1`.

Given that `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, for the loop to execute, `lis` must contain at least 2 elements. The variable `j` should start at 1 as specified in the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `test` is True, `j` is 1**
