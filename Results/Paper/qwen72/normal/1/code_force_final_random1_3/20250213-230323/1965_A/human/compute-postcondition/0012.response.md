Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive; `A` is `True`; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr`, including the number 1, and `len(set_)` must be greater than 1; `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element and the first element of `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `not_c` remains `True`.**
