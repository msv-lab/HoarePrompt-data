Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `_` is a placeholder (not relevant to the calculation).
2. `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This means the user inputs a positive integer.
3. `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.
4. `cnt` is calculated as follows:
   - If the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, then `cnt` is `1 +` the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in `a`.
   - Otherwise, `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(cnt)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **User Input**: The user provides a list of integers `a`.
2. **Check First Three Elements**:
   - If the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, then:
     - Calculate `cnt` as `1 +` the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in `a`.
   - Otherwise:
     - Calculate `cnt` as the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in `a`.

3. **Calculate `cnt`**:
   - For each element `x` in `a`, compute `math.floor(x / 2)`.
   - Sum these values.
   - If the first three elements are equal and odd, add 1 to the sum.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example to illustrate the calculation:

- Suppose the user inputs the list `a = [3, 3, 3, 4, 5]`.
  - The first three elements are `[3, 3, 3]`, which are equal and odd.
  - Calculate `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element:
    - `math.floor(3 / 2) = 1`
    - `math.floor(3 / 2) = 1`
    - `math.floor(3 / 2) = 1`
    - `math.floor(4 / 2) = 2`
    - `math.floor(5 / 2) = 2`
  - Sum these values: `1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7`
  - Since the first three elements are equal and odd, add 1: `7 + 1 = 8`
  - Therefore, `cnt = 8`.

### General Output:
Based on the initial state and the calculation, the output will be the value of `cnt` as described above.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of math.floor(x / 2) for all elements x in a, or 1 + the sum of math.floor(x / 2) for all elements x in a if the first three elements of a are equal and odd)**
