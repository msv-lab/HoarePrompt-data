You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, p_i are integers such that 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, representing the counts of the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the sequence.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p` is a list of the nearest even numbers derived from the input integers, the loop has run `t` times, and there are 0 iterations left.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it reads a list of integers `p` (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing counts of the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in a sequence. It then processes these counts to determine and print a value for each test case. The value printed is the sum of two components: 1) 1 if the first three elements of `p` (after being adjusted to the nearest even number) have an odd sum, and 0 otherwise; 2) half the sum of the adjusted `p` values. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is zero.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR is non-zero.
   - The sequence consists of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, and we are given the counts of these numbers.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position that is set to 1 is even.
   - For numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4:
     - 1 (binary: 001)
     - 2 (binary: 010)
     - 3 (binary: 011)
     - 4 (binary: 100)
   - The XOR of these numbers can be simplified by considering their parity (even or odd counts).

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function `func` processes each test case.
   - It reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It uses a lambda function to adjust the counts to be even by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2.
   - It then checks if the sum of the parities of the first three counts (1s, 2s, 3s) is 3, which indicates a special condition.
   - Finally, it prints the result, which is the sum of the adjusted counts divided by 2 plus the special condition check.

4. **Special Condition**:
   - The condition `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if all three counts (1s, 2s, 3s) are odd.
   - If this condition is true, it adds 1 to the result, indicating an additional win for Bob.

5. **Result Calculation**:
   - The main result is calculated as `sum(p) // 2`, which effectively counts the number of pairs of numbers that can be removed to make the XOR zero.
   - Adding the special condition ensures that if all three counts are odd, Bob gets an extra win.

6. **Verification**:
   - The logic aligns with the problem statement and the examples provided.
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.
