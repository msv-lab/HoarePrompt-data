Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This means the user is expected to input a positive integer.
2. `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.
3. `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the list `a`.
4. If `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` are all equal and odd, `cnt` starts with an initial value of 1; otherwise, `cnt` starts with an initial value of 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(cnt)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **User Input**: The user inputs a positive integer, but this input is not directly used in the calculation of `cnt`. It is likely used to determine the number of elements in the list `a`.

2. **List `a`**: The user then inputs a list of integers. For example, if the user inputs `5`, they might enter a list like `[3, 6, 9, 2, 8]`.

3. **Initial Value of `cnt`**:
   - If the first three elements of `a` (`a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`) are all equal and odd, `cnt` starts with an initial value of 1.
   - Otherwise, `cnt` starts with an initial value of 0.

4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - For each element `x` in the list `a`, `math.floor(x / 2)` is calculated.
   - These values are summed up to get the final value of `cnt`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example where the user inputs the list `[3, 3, 3, 6, 9]`:
- The first three elements are `[3, 3, 3]`, which are all equal and odd. Therefore, `cnt` starts with an initial value of 1.
- Now, we calculate `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element:
  - `math.floor(3 / 2) = 1`
  - `math.floor(3 / 2) = 1`
  - `math.floor(3 / 2) = 1`
  - `math.floor(6 / 2) = 3`
  - `math.floor(9 / 2) = 4`
- Summing these values: `1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 = 10`
- Adding the initial value of `cnt`: `1 + 10 = 11`

### Final Output:
The `print(cnt)` statement will print the final value of `cnt` after the calculations.

Output: **11 (where 11 is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the list `a`, plus 1 if the first three elements are all equal and odd)**
