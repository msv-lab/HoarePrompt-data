The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then applies a lambda function to each integer. The lambda function subtracts the remainder of the integer divided by 2 from the integer itself, effectively rounding down to the nearest even number. The result is stored in the list `p`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, representing the counts of the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the sequence.
- The input must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `p` is populated with the nearest even numbers derived from the input integers.
- The values of `t` and `p_i` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, `p` is a list of the nearest even numbers derived from the input integers.**
