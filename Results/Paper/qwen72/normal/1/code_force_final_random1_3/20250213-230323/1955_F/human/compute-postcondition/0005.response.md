Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `p` is a list of the nearest even numbers derived from the input integers.
- The loop has run once, and there are `int(input()) - 1` iterations left.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `p`**:
   - `p` is a list of the nearest even numbers derived from the input integers. This means every element in `p` is an even number.

2. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `p[:3]`: This takes the first three elements of the list `p`.
   - `map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])`: This applies a lambda function to each element in the first three elements of `p`. The lambda function checks if the element is odd (`x % 2 > 0`). Since all elements in `p` are even, this will always return `False`.
   - `list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))`: This converts the map object to a list, resulting in `[False, False, False]`.
   - `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))`: This sums the list of boolean values, where `False` is treated as 0. Therefore, the sum is 0.
   - `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)`: This checks if the sum is equal to 3. Since the sum is 0, this evaluates to `False`, which is equivalent to 0 in integer context.
   - `sum(p) // 2`: This calculates the sum of all elements in `p` and then performs integer division by 2.

3. **Final Expression**:
   - The expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2` simplifies to `0 + sum(p) // 2`.

### Conclusion:
- The final output will be the integer division of the sum of all elements in `p` by 2.

### Output:
Output: **sum(p) // 2 (where sum(p) is the sum of all elements in the list p)**
