### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is zero.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR is non-zero.
   - The sequence consists of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, and we are given the counts of these numbers.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position that is set to 1 is even.
   - For numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4:
     - 1 (binary: 001)
     - 2 (binary: 010)
     - 3 (binary: 011)
     - 4 (binary: 100)
   - The XOR of these numbers can be simplified by considering their parity (even or odd counts).

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function `func` processes each test case.
   - It reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It uses a lambda function to adjust the counts to be even by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2.
   - It then checks if the sum of the parities of the first three counts (1s, 2s, 3s) is 3, which indicates a special condition.
   - Finally, it prints the result, which is the sum of the adjusted counts divided by 2 plus the special condition check.

4. **Special Condition**:
   - The condition `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if all three counts (1s, 2s, 3s) are odd.
   - If this condition is true, it adds 1 to the result, indicating an additional win for Bob.

5. **Result Calculation**:
   - The main result is calculated as `sum(p) // 2`, which effectively counts the number of pairs of numbers that can be removed to make the XOR zero.
   - Adding the special condition ensures that if all three counts are odd, Bob gets an extra win.

6. **Verification**:
   - The logic aligns with the problem statement and the examples provided.
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.
