Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in `a`.**

### Explanation:
- The initial condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
- The list `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, and this also remains unchanged.
- The variable `cnt` is updated within the loop to accumulate the value of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the list `a`. After the loop has completed all its iterations, `cnt` will hold the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements in the list `a`.
