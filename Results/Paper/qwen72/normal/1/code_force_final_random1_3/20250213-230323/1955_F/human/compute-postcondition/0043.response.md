Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a series of test cases, each consisting of four integers. For each test case, it calculates a count (`cnt`) based on the following rules: If the first three integers are equal and odd, `cnt` starts at 1; otherwise, it starts at 0. Then, for each integer in the test case, `cnt` is incremented by the floor division of the integer by 2. The function prints the final value of `cnt` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the program state reflects the number of test cases processed and the results printed for each. **
