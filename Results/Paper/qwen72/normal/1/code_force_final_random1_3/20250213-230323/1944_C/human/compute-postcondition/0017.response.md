Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each element satisfies the condition 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`).
- The length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5).
- `nums` is a `Counter` object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
- `nums[0]` is decremented by 1.
- `start` is 1.
- `vis` is a set containing the elements 0 and 1.
- `nums[1]` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(start + 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `start` is explicitly given as 1.
- The expression `start + 1` will evaluate to `1 + 1`, which is 2.

### Output:
The code will print the result of the expression `start + 1`.

Output: **2**
