The value of `nums[start]` is decremented by 1. Since `start` is 0, `nums[0]` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `nums[0]` is now `nums[0] - 1`. `start` is 0. `vis` is a set containing the element 0.**
