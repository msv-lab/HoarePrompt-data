Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem of finding the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play their game optimally. The key to solving this problem is understanding how both players can manipulate the array to either maximize or minimize the MEX value.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in `arr`.
   - It initializes `start` to 0 and a set `vis` to keep track of visited elements.
   - The loop continues until the current `start` value is no longer present in the `nums` counter.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It marks the current `start` value as visited.
     - Decrements the count of the current `start` value in the `nums` counter.
     - Checks if the next value (`start + 1`) is present in the `nums` counter.
       - If it is, it decrements the count of `start + 1` and increments `start`.
       - If it is not, it prints `start + 1` and returns.
   - If the loop completes without encountering a condition where `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is false, it prints `start`.

### Correctness Check:

- **Optimal Play:**
  - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
  - The logic in the loop ensures that Alice and Bob are making optimal moves by always choosing the smallest available number that can still be chosen.
  - The loop correctly simulates the game by decrementing the counts of the chosen numbers and moving to the next number if possible.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where the array is empty or contains only one element correctly.
  - The program also handles the case where all elements are the same or where the elements are in a sequence.

- **Output:**
  - The output is the MEX of the array `c` after the game is played optimally.
  - The program correctly prints the MEX value for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play their game optimally. The logic and the implementation are consistent with the problem description and handle all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
