Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`. `start` is 0. `vis` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new set called `vis` which is initially empty. The other variables (`arr`, `nums`, and `start`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
