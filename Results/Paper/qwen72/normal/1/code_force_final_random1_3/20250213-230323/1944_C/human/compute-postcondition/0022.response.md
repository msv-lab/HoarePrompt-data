The code snippet `nums[start] -= 1` decrements the value of `nums[start]` by 1. Given the initial conditions:

- `arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5).
- `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
- `nums[0]` is now `nums[0] - 1`.
- `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - 1` and must be greater than 0.
- `start` is 1.
- `vis` is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 1.
- If `nums.get(2, 0)` is true, `start` is updated to 2, and `nums[2]` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0.

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. **Initial Value of `start`:**
   - `start` is initially 1.
   - If `nums.get(2, 0)` is true, `start` is updated to 2, and `nums[2]` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0.

2. **Decrementing `nums[start]`:**
   - If `start` is 1, `nums[1]` is decremented by 1.
   - If `start` is 2, `nums[2]` is decremented by 1.

Given the conditions, let's consider both cases:

### Case 1: `start` is 1
- `nums[1]` is decremented by 1.
- `nums[1]` was already decremented by 1 initially, so it is now `nums[1] - 2`.

### Case 2: `start` is 2
- `nums[2]` is decremented by 1.
- `nums[2]` was already decremented by 1 initially, so it is now `nums[2] - 2`.

### Final Output State:
- If `start` is 1:
  - `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - 2`.
  - All other conditions remain unchanged.

- If `start` is 2:
  - `nums[2]` is now `nums[2] - 2`.
  - All other conditions remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`. `nums[0]` is now `nums[0] - 1`. If `start` is 1, `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - 2`. If `start` is 2, `nums[2]` is now `nums[2] - 2`. `start` is either 1 or 2. `vis` is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 1.**
