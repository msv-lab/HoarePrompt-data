Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`. `start` is 0.** 

The variable `start` has been initialized to 0, while the other variables (`arr` and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
