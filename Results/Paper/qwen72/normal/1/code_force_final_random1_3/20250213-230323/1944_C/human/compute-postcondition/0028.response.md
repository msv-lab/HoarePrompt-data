Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `arr` remains a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). `nums` is a Counter object where the frequencies of the integers in `arr` have been adjusted according to the loop's operations. Specifically, for each integer `i` that was visited (`i` in `vis`), `nums[i]` has been decremented by 1, and if `i + 1` was also visited, `nums[i + 1]` has been decremented by 1. The variable `start` will be the last index that was processed before the loop terminated, and `vis` will contain all the indices that were visited during the loop's execution. If the loop completes without encountering a condition where `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is false, it will print `start + 1` and terminate.**
