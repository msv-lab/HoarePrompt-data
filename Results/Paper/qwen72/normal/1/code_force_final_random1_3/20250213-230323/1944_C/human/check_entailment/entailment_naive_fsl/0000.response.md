Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not ensure that Alice always maximizes the score and Bob always minimizes it. Here is a counterexample:

### Counterexample:
**Input:**
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

### Explanation:
- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - Alice should pick the smallest number available to maximize the MEX.
  - Bob should pick the next smallest number to minimize the MEX.

**Optimal Play:**
1. Alice picks 0. Array becomes `[1, 2, 3]`, `c = [0]`.
2. Bob picks 1. Array becomes `[2, 3]`, `c = [0]`.
3. Alice picks 2. Array becomes `[3]`, `c = [0, 2]`.
4. Bob picks 3. Array becomes `[]`, `c = [0, 2]`.

The MEX of `[0, 2]` is 1, so the expected output is 1.

However, the provided code outputs 2, which is incorrect. This indicates that the logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the optimal strategies of both players.
