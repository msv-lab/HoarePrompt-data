The value of `start` is incremented by 1. Since `start` is either 1 or 2 initially, after the increment, `start` will be either 2 or 3. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`. `nums[0]` is now `nums[0] - 1`. If `start` was 1, `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - 2` and `nums[2]` is now `nums[2] - 1`. If `start` was 2, `nums[2]` is now `nums[2] - 2` and `nums[3]` is now `nums[3] - 1`. `start` is now either 2 or 3. `vis` is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 1.**
