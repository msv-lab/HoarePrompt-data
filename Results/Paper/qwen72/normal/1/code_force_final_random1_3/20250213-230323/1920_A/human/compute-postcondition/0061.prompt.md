You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. start and end are floating-point numbers initialized to -1 and 1000000000.0 respectively. num is an initially empty list.
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000.0
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` is the number of iterations completed, `i` is `n-1`, `start` is the maximum value encountered when `t` was 1, `end` is the minimum value encountered when `t` was 2, and `num` is a list containing all values of `v` encountered when `t` was 3. The initial values of `start` (-1) and `end` (1000000000.0) are updated only if conditions within the loop are met.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` is the total number of elements in `num`, `i` is the last element in `num`, `start` remains the maximum value encountered when `t` was 1, `end` remains the minimum value encountered when `t` was 2, `num` contains all values of `v` encountered when `t` was 3, and `count_num` is the count of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive).
    if (start > end) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` is the total number of elements in `num`, `i` is the last element in `num`, `start` remains the maximum value encountered when `t` was 1, `end` remains the minimum value encountered when `t` was 2, `num` contains all values of `v` encountered when `t` was 3, and `count_num` is the count of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive). Additionally, `start` is less than or equal to `end`.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `end` is the minimum value encountered when `t` was 2, `start` is the maximum value encountered when `t` was 1, and `count_num` is the count of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function evaluates the range between `start` and `end` and the count of elements in `num` within this range. It returns 0 if the range is less than the count of elements. Otherwise, it returns the adjusted difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus the count of elements in `num` within the range.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `end` is the minimum value encountered when `t` was 2, `start` is the maximum value encountered when `t` was 1, and `count_num` is the count of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
