Functionality: ** The function `func_7` reads an integer `n` and processes `n` pairs of integers `(t, v)` from the user. It updates two boundary values, `start` and `end`, based on the type `t` of each pair. If `t` is 1, `start` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `v`. If `t` is 2, `end` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `v`. If `t` is 3, `v` is added to a list `num`. After processing all pairs, the function counts the number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive), denoted as `count_num`. If `start` is greater than `end`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num`, unless this difference is less than `count_num`, in which case it also returns 0. **
