The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0, as it is the initial value for the range function.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list**
