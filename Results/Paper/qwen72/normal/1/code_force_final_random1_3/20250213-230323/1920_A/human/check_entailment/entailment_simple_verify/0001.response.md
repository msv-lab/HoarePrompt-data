### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_7` correctly reads the number of constraints `n` and initializes the range for `k` with `start` set to `-1` and `end` set to `1000000000.0`. This initialization ensures that any valid constraints will update these values appropriately.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - For type 1 constraints (`k >= x`), the function updates `start` to the maximum of its current value and `x`. This ensures that `start` is the highest lower bound.
   - For type 2 constraints (`k <= x`), the function updates `end` to the minimum of its current value and `x`. This ensures that `end` is the lowest upper bound.
   - For type 3 constraints (`k != x`), the function appends `x` to the list `num`. This list keeps track of all values that `k` cannot be.

3. **Range Validation**:
   - After processing all constraints, the function checks if `start` is greater than `end`. If so, it returns `0` because no integer can satisfy the constraints. This is a correct check to ensure the range is valid.

4. **Counting Excluded Values**:
   - The function iterates through the list `num` to count how many of these excluded values fall within the range `[start, end]`. This count is stored in `count_num`. This step is necessary to exclude the values that are explicitly forbidden by the constraints.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]` and subtracts the number of excluded values. It ensures the result is non-negative by returning `0` if the calculated value is negative. This calculation is correct and ensures that the final count is accurate.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the range is invalid (i.e., `start > end`) by returning `0`. This is a correct handling of such cases.

### Final Evaluation:
The function `func_7` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
