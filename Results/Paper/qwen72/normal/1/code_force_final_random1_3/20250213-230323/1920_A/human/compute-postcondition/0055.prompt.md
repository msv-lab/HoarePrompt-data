Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` is the number of iterations completed, `i` is `n-1`, `start` is the maximum value encountered when `t` was 1, `end` is the minimum value encountered when `t` was 2, `num` is a list containing all values of `v` encountered when `t` was 3, and `count_num` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in num:
    if i < start or i > end:
        continue
    else:
        count_num += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`num` is a list containing at least one element, and `i` is the first element in `num`. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the loop continues to the next iteration. If `i` is greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`, `count_num` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`num` is still a list containing at least one element. `i` will be the next element in `num` (the second element if the list has at least two elements). If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `count_num` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`num` is a list containing at least one element. `i` is the next element in `num` (the third element if the list has at least three elements). If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `i` is within the range defined by `start` and `end` (inclusive), `count_num` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_num` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
