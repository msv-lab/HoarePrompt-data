The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `t` and `v`, respectively. This operation does not affect the initial state of `n`, `i`, `end`, or `num`. However, it sets the stage for potential changes in subsequent logic based on the values of `t` and `v`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `t` and `v` are input integers.**
