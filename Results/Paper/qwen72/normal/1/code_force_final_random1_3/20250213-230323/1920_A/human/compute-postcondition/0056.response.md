Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` is the total number of elements in `num`, `i` is the last element in `num`, `start` remains the maximum value encountered when `t` was 1, `end` remains the minimum value encountered when `t` was 2, `num` contains all values of `v` encountered when `t` was 3, and `count_num` is the count of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive). Additionally, `start` is greater than `end`.**
