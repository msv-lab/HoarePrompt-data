Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input and output as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the problem requires processing multiple test cases, but the provided program only processes a single test case. Additionally, the functions `func_1` through `func_6` are not used in the main logic of the program, and their presence suggests that the program might be incomplete or incorrectly structured.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
2
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
2
1 5
2 4
```
The expected output is:
```
7
0
```
However, the provided program will only process the first test case and will not handle the second test case, leading to incorrect output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
