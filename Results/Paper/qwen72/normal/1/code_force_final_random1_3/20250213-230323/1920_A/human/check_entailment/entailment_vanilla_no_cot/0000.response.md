Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_7` reads the number of constraints and processes each constraint accordingly.
2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - For type 1 constraints (`k ≥ x`), it updates the minimum value `start`.
   - For type 2 constraints (`k ≤ x`), it updates the maximum value `end`.
   - For type 3 constraints (`k ≠ x`), it adds the value to a list `num`.
3. **Range Calculation**:
   - It calculates the range of valid `k` values as `end - start + 1`.
   - It subtracts the count of invalid values from this range.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `start > end`, it returns 0, indicating no valid `k` values.
   - If the calculated range is less than the count of invalid values, it returns 0.

The program handles all the constraints and edge cases correctly, ensuring that it produces the correct output for the given problem description.
