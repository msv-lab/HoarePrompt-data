Postcondition: ***`num` is a list containing at least one element. `i` is the next element in `num` (the third element if the list has at least three elements). If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `i` is within the range defined by `start` and `end` (inclusive), `count_num` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_num` remains unchanged.***
