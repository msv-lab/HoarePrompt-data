Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of elements in an array that can be made equal by adding a permutation to the array. The key insight here is that adding a permutation (which consists of unique numbers from 1 to n) to the array can potentially make several elements equal, especially if the original array has elements that are close to each other.

However, the provided program does not actually solve this problem. It contains several functions that read input data in different formats, but none of these functions address the core logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program lacks any function or logic that:

1. Reads the number of test cases and iterates over them.
2. Reads the length of the array and the array itself for each test case.
3. Implements the logic to add a permutation to the array and count the maximum frequency of any element after the addition.
4. Outputs the result for each test case.

The functions `func_1` to `func_7` are just different ways to read input, and `func_8` and `func_9` are for calculating prefix and suffix products, which are not relevant to the problem at hand.

Given that the program does not contain any logic to solve the problem, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
