Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers with at least one element, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, `tem` is equal to `arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`**

Explanation: The value of `tem` is updated to be the product of the last element of `arr` and the second-to-last element of `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
