### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements in an array that can be made equal by adding a permutation of the same length to the array.
   - The permutation must consist of distinct integers from 1 to n.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The main loop iterates over multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, the program reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - The array is sorted and converted to a set to remove duplicates.
   - The program then iterates over the unique elements of the array and uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1()`**: Reads an integer from the input. This is used to read the number of test cases and the length of the array.
   - **`func_3()`**: Reads a list of integers from the input. This is used to read the array elements.
   - **Main Logic**:
     - The array is sorted and converted to a set to remove duplicates.
     - The program then iterates over the unique elements of the array.
     - For each element, it uses `bisect_left` to find the position of the element plus `n` in the sorted array.
     - The difference between the current index and the found index gives the count of elements that can be made equal.
     - The maximum of these counts is stored and printed.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - The use of `set` and `sorted` ensures that the unique elements are considered.
   - The logic using `bisect_left` to find the maximum count of elements that can be made equal is correct.
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

**Correctness: **True****
