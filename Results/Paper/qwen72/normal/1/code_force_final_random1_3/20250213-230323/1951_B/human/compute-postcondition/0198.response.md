Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of cows `n`, the index `k` of the cow of interest, and a list `a` of distinct Cowdeforces ratings. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of cows whose ratings are less than or equal to the rating of the cow at index `k` when the cow at index `k` is swapped with the first cow in the list, or when the cow at index `k` is swapped with the first cow and then moved to the position where the next higher-rated cow is found. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `s` retain their last assigned values or states as described in the annotations. **
