To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - `i`: This variable will take on the values of elements in the list `s` starting from the second element (`s[1:]`).
   - `s`: This is the list of integers, with the first element (`s[0]`) and the `k-1`-th element (`s[k-1]`) swapped.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if there are elements in `s[1:]`.
   - Therefore, `s` must have at least two elements for the loop to execute.

3. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - `s` must have at least two elements.
   - `i` will be the first element of `s[1:]`, which is `s[1]`.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `n` and `k` retain their original values.
   - `ans1` will be incremented based on conditions described in the loop body.
   - `z` will be 1 if any element in `s` equals `h`, otherwise it will remain 0.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `h` is now equal to the value of `s[0]` (which was originally the value of `s[k-1]`).
   - `j` is -1.

### Adjusted State:
- `s` must have at least two elements.
- `i` is the first element of `s[1:]`, which is `s[1]`.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is `s[1]`, `n` and `k` retain their original values, `ans1` will be incremented based on conditions described, `z` will be 1 if any element in `s` equals `h`, otherwise it will remain 0, `ans` is 0, `h` is now equal to the value of `s[0]` (which was originally the value of `s[k-1]`), `j` is -1**.
