The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of cows, and an index specifying a particular cow. Here are the details:

- The function accepts the following parameters:
  - `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
  - For each test case:
    - `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cows.
    - `k`: An integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the index of your cow.
    - `a`: A list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and all `a_i`'s are distinct.
  - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

- The function returns the result for each test case, which is the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at the specified index `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of cows `n`, the index `k` of the cow of interest, and a list `a` of distinct Cowdeforces ratings. It returns the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at the specified index `k` for each test case.**
