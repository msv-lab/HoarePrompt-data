To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans, ans1))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from input.
   - `s` is a list of integers read from input with at least two elements.
   - The first element of `s` (s[0]) and the `k-1`th element of `s` (s[k-1]) have been swapped back to their original positions.
   - `h` is now the value of `s[k-1]` after the swap.
   - `j` is the index of the last element processed in `s[1:]` before breaking out of the loop or reaching the end of `s[1:]`.
   - `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` until the loop breaks or ends.
   - `p` is equal to `j`.
   - `i` is the last element of `s` that was processed before the loop broke or ended.
   - If `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are equal to `h` and come after the first occurrence of `h` in `s[1:]`, and `z` is 1.
   - If `i` is greater than `h`, the loop broke out because `i` is greater than `h`, and `ans1` and `z` remain as they were before the loop broke.
   - If `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are equal to `h` and come after the first occurrence of `h` in `s[1:]`, and `z` is 1.
   - If `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is 0, `ans1` and `z` remain unchanged.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `ans` counts the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` until the loop breaks or ends.
   - `ans1` counts the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are equal to `h` and come after the first occurrence of `h` in `s[1:]`.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - The `print(max(ans, ans1))` statement will print the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1`.
   - `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`.
   - `ans1` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are equal to `h` and come after the first occurrence of `h`.

Given the conditions and the definitions of `ans` and `ans1`, the output will be the maximum of these two counts.

Output: **max(ans, ans1) (where ans is the number of elements in s[1:] that are less than or equal to h, and ans1 is the number of elements in s[1:] that are equal to h and come after the first occurrence of h in s[1:])**
