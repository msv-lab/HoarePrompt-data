#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #An error occurs because `b` cannot be unpacked into `dx` and `dy`. The program does not return any values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, both expected to be tuples or lists containing two elements. However, due to an error in the code, it attempts to unpack `b` into `dx` and `dy`, which fails if `b` is not a tuple or list with exactly two elements. As a result, the function does not return any values and results in an error.
