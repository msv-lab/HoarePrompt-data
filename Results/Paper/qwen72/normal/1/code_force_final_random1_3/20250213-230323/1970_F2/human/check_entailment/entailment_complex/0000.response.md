Reasoning:

The annotated program has a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure its correctness:

1. **Function `func_1` Error**: The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the movement of entities on the grid. However, the function definition and usage are incorrect. Specifically, the function should take two tuples (or lists) as arguments, where the first argument represents the current position and the second argument represents the direction of movement. The function should return a new position after applying the movement. The current implementation attempts to unpack `b` into `dx` and `dy`, which will fail if `b` is not a tuple or list with exactly two elements. This is a critical error that would cause the program to fail.

2. **Handling of Player Elimination**: The logic for handling player elimination when a player is on the same cell as a Bludger is mostly correct. However, the way the `quidditch` variable is updated when a player carrying the Quaffle is eliminated is incorrect. The Quaffle should remain on the cell where the player was eliminated, but the current implementation sets `quidditch` to the position of the eliminated player, which is not correct.

3. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic is mostly correct, but there are some edge cases that might not be handled correctly. For example, when a player scores in the wrong goal, the program should award the point to the opposing team. The current implementation seems to handle this correctly, but it's important to verify that the conditions are checked in the correct order.

4. **Quaffle Reset Position**: When a goal is scored, the Quaffle should be reset to the middle of the field. The current implementation handles this correctly, but it should be double-checked to ensure that the Quaffle is always reset to the correct position.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it stands. The function `func_1` needs to be fixed, and the handling of the Quaffle when a player is eliminated needs to be corrected.

Correctness: **False**
