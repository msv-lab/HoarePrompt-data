The code attempts to unpack the integer `b` into two variables `dx` and `dy`. Since `b` is an integer and not an iterable, this operation will raise a `ValueError` indicating that the integer cannot be unpacked. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, an error occurs because `b` cannot be unpacked into `dx` and `dy`.**
