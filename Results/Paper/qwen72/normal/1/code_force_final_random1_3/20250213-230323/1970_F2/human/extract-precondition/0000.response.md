Precondition: **a and b are integers.** 

However, based on the problem description provided, the function definition `def func_1(a, b):` does not seem to match the complexity of the problem described. The problem involves a detailed simulation of a Quidditch game, which would require a more complex function signature and parameters to handle the game state, player movements, and scoring. If you intended to provide a function definition that aligns with the problem description, it might look something like this:

```python
def simulate_quidditch_game(N, M, field, T, actions):
```

For this function, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **N and M are integers such that 3 <= N, M <= 99 and N, M are odd; field is a list of N strings, each string containing M pairs of characters representing the initial state of the field; T is an integer such that 0 <= T <= 10000; actions is a list of T strings, each describing an action in the game.**
