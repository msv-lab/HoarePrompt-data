Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as specified. The program sorts the array and then prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values (`a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`). This approach does not align with the problem's requirement to calculate the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

To further illustrate the issue, let's consider another test case:

Input:
```
1
5
100 54 80 43 90
```

Expected Output:
```
57
```

Actual Output from the provided program:
```
47
```

The expected output is calculated as follows:
1. Sort the array: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
2. Calculate the sum of differences: `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`

The provided program, however, simply prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values: `100 - 43 = 47`.

Thus, the program's logic is fundamentally flawed and does not meet the problem's requirements. The correct approach, as suggested in the original assessment, involves sorting the array and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Final: **False**
