Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ntest` must be greater than 1, `itest` is 1.** 

The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer, which is within the range 2 to 100. All other variables remain unchanged.
