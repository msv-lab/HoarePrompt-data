Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `ntest` must be greater than 2, `itest` is 2**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to the integer input provided by the user, which is constrained to be between 2 and 100. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `ntest`, and `itest`) remain unchanged.
