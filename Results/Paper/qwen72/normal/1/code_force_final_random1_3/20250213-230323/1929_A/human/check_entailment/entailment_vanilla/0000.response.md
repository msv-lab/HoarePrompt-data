Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the "beauty" of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. Mathematically, this is expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})
   \]

2. **Optimal Rearrangement**: To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. The optimal way to do this is to sort the array in ascending order. This ensures that the differences \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) are as large as possible for the largest elements and as small as possible for the smallest elements.

3. **Simplification**: When the array is sorted, the beauty can be simplified to:
   \[
   \text{Beauty} = (a_n - a_{n-1}) + (a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}) + \cdots + (a_2 - a_1)
   \]
   Notice that all intermediate terms cancel out, leaving:
   \[
   \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1
   \]
   This means the maximum beauty is simply the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the array.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It prints the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted array.

5. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly sorts the array.
   - It computes the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, which is the correct approach to maximize the beauty.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as required.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
