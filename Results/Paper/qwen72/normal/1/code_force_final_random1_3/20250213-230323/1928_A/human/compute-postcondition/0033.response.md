Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The variable `i` is equal to `t - 1`. For each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated to the positive integers provided by the input for that specific test case. The loop prints 'yes' if both `a` and `b` are even, or if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd. It prints 'no' if the conditions `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` are met, or if the difference between `a` and `b` is even.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be one less than the total number of test cases (`t`). For each test case, the values of `a` and `b` are read from the input, and the loop checks the conditions specified in the code. The loop will print 'yes' if both `a` and `b` are even or if their difference is odd. It will print 'no' if the conditions `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` are met, or if the difference between `a` and `b` is even. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` for each test case are determined by the input provided.
