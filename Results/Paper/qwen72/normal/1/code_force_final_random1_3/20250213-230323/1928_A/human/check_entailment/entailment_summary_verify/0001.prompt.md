You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. The function then checks the following conditions for each pair of `a` and `b`: 
- If both `a` and `b` are even, it prints 'yes'.
- If the conditions `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` are met, it prints 'no'.
- If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, it prints 'yes'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'no'. 
After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate output ('yes' or 'no') has been printed for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to determine if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then recombined to form a new rectangle that is not identical to the original (considering rotations).

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle**:
   - If both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are even, we can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and recombine them to form a new rectangle. For example, a \(4 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into two \(4 \times 3\) rectangles and recombined to form a \(6 \times 4\) rectangle.
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is odd, the problem becomes more complex. We need to check if the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is such that it allows for forming a new rectangle.

3. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - It checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are even and prints 'yes' if true.
   - It then checks some conditions involving the differences between \(a\) and \(b\), but these conditions are not clear and do not seem to correctly handle all cases.

4. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0` is correct for the case where both dimensions are even.
   - The conditions `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` and `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` are incorrect and do not make logical sense in the context of the problem.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, the answer is 'yes'.
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is odd, we need to check if the other dimension is at least twice the odd dimension. For example, a \(2 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and recombined to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.

Given the issues in the logic, the program is incorrect.
