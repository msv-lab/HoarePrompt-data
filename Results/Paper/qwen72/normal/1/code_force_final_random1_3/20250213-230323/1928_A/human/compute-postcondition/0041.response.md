The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow of control within a loop.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `a1` is `a // 2`, `a2` is `a // 2`. We skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
