Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` and `b` are updated to the positive integers provided by the input, and `i` is 2. If `(a - b) % 2` is not equal to 0, the program behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as specified in the else part.*** 

However, since the if and else parts result in the same postconditions, the overall postcondition simplifies to: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` and `b` are updated to the positive integers provided by the input, and `i` is 2.***
