The `print('Yes')` statement will simply print the string `'Yes'` to the console. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, and `a2`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the content of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Output: **Yes**
