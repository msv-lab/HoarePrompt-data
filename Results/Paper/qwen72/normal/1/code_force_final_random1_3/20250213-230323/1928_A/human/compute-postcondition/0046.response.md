Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user. If `a` is even, `a1` is set to `a // 2`, and `a2` is set to `a // 2`. `b1` is set to `b // 2`, and `b2` is set to `b // 2`. If `a1` is not equal to `b`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped and the program moves to the next iteration.** 

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. No variables are updated by the `continue` statement itself, so the state remains unchanged except for the fact that the loop control will proceed to the next iteration.
