To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`.
- The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop will execute if the input value is greater than 0.
- The variable `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

### Final State:
- The input value must be a positive integer.
- The variable `i` should be 0.

### State:
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\), `i` is 0, and the input value must be a positive integer.**
