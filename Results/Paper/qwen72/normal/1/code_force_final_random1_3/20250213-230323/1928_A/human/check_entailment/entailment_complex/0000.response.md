Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle from an existing one by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. The logic in the program is flawed in several ways:

1. **Even Check**: The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` correctly identifies that if both dimensions are even, Bob can always form a new rectangle by cutting and rearranging. This part is correct.

2. **Incorrect Conditions**: The conditions `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are logically incorrect and do not make sense in the context of the problem. These conditions are always false because they compare a tuple with a boolean value, which is not meaningful.

3. **Odd Difference Check**: The condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is intended to check if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd. However, the expression `(a - b) % 2` will always be either 0 or 1, so the condition `or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is redundant and always false. A simpler and correct way to check if the difference is odd is `if (a - b) % 2 != 0`.

4. **Default Case**: The default case `else: print('no')` is incorrect because it does not cover all possible scenarios where Bob can form a new rectangle. For example, if one dimension is even and the other is odd, Bob can still form a new rectangle by cutting the even dimension in half and rearranging the pieces.

A correct implementation should check if at least one of the dimensions is even, as this is sufficient to ensure that Bob can form a new rectangle. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
