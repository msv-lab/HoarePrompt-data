Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` and `b` are updated to the positive integers provided by the input, `i` is 0, and the input value must be a positive integer. Additionally, either `a` is odd or `b` is odd. The condition \((a - b == -a, a)\) or \((b - a == -b, b)\) is false.**
