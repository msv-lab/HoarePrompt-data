Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` remains the same, `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned new values from the input where `q` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are not yet updated, `ad` and `bd` are not yet updated, `i` is 1, `v` is not yet updated, `m` is not yet computed, `ql` is not yet updated, `s` is not yet determined, and `l` is not yet updated.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `_` is 1 and `t` remains the same, which are not affected by the given code snippet.
- The code snippet `n, k, q = map(int, input().split())` assigns new values to `n`, `k`, and `q` based on user input. These values are taken from the input, and `q` must be greater than 0.
- The variables `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `m`, `ql`, `s`, and `l` are not updated by this code snippet, so they remain in their initial state or are not yet determined.
