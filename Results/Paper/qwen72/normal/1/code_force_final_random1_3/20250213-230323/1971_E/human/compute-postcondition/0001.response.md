The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly set.

Since `t` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), this ensures that `t` is always greater than 0, and thus the loop will execute at least once.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. However, if we strictly follow the format and consider the initial state, we can state:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration**
