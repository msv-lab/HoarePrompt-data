Output State: **All variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `i`, `v`, `s`) retain their original values. If `a[s] == ql`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`. `m` is increased by `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- The value of `m` is increased by `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
