Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `ad` is a list containing `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `bd` is a list containing `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`, `i` is `len(b)`, `len(a) <= len(b)`, `v` is `[0, ad[i-1] / bd[i-1], ad[i] / bd[i]]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` is calculated and appended to the list `v`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The list `v` now contains three elements: `[0, ad[i-1] / bd[i-1], ad[i] / bd[i]]`.
