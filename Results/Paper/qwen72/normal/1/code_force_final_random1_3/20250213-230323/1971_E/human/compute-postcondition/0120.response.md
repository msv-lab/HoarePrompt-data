To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation of `m` step by step.

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0.
- `t` remains the same (not used in the print statement).
- `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned new values from the input, with `q` being greater than 0.
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers provided by the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements.
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers provided by the input and must have at least `len(a) + 1` elements.
- `ad` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `a`: `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`.
- `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`: `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `v` is a list of ratios of corresponding elements of `ad` and `bd`: `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`.
- `m` is computed as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.
- `ql` is the input integer minus `a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`.
- If `a[s]` is equal to the original `ql`, the next iteration will be skipped.
- `l` is incremented by 1.
- `q` must be greater than the new value of `l`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `s`**: 
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`.
   - Let's assume `ql` is some integer `Q` and `a` is a sorted list of integers.

2. **Compute `ql`**:
   - `ql = Q - a[s - 1]`.

3. **Compute `m`**:
   - `m = b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.
   - Here, `b[s - 1]` is the element in `b` at index `s - 1`.
   - `bd[s]` is the difference between `b[s]` and `b[s - 1]`.
   - `ad[s]` is the difference between `a[s]` and `a[s - 1]`.

4. **Print `int(m)`**:
   - The `print` statement will print the integer part of `m`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume:
- `a = [0, 1, 3, 5]`
- `b = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`
- `ql = 4`

1. **Determine `s`**:
   - The first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to 4 is `a[2] = 3`.
   - So, `s = 2`.

2. **Compute `ql`**:
   - `ql = 4 - a[1] = 4 - 1 = 3`.

3. **Compute `m`**:
   - `b[s - 1] = b[1] = 2`.
   - `bd[s] = b[2] - b[1] = 4 - 2 = 2`.
   - `ad[s] = a[2] - a[1] = 3 - 1 = 2`.
   - `m = 2 + 2 * (3 - 1) / 2 = 2 + 2 * 2 / 2 = 2 + 2 = 4`.

4. **Print `int(m)`**:
   - The integer part of `m` is 4.

### Final Output:
Output: **4**
