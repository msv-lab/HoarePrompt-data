Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It processes multiple test cases, reads the necessary inputs, and computes the time taken to reach each queried point, rounding down to the nearest integer. The use of `bisect_left` from the `bisect` module efficiently finds the position where the query point fits within the known points, allowing for accurate calculation of the travel time based on the speeds between known points. The logic for handling the queries and calculating the times is sound and aligns with the requirements of the problem statement.
