Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `ad` is a list containing `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `bd` is a list containing `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`, `i` is `len(b) + len(a) - 2`, `len(a) <= len(b)`, `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the list `a` starting from 1 up to `len(a) - 1`.
- In each iteration, the value `ad[i] / bd[i]` is appended to the list `v`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `len(b) + len(a) - 2` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
- The list `v` will contain the initial value `0` followed by the results of the division `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
