Output State: **`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `l` (incremented by 1), `m` (now `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`), `i` (now 1), `s` (index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order), `ql` (decremented by `a[s - 1]`). If `a[s] == ql`, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. `q` must be greater than the new value of `l`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, except for the changes already mentioned in the initial state.
