Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` remains the same, `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned new values from the input, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the input and must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the input, `ad` is now `[0, a[1] - a[0]]`, `bd` is `[0]`, `i` is 1, all other variables (`v`, `l`, `m`, `s`, `ql`) retain their values as they were at the end of the previous iteration.**
