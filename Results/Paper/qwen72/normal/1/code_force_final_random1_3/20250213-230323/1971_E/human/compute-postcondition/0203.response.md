The function `func` accepts no direct parameters but is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, representing the final destination.
  - `k`: An integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, representing the number of known time points.
  - `q`: An integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries.
  - `a`: A list of k integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, with a_k = n, representing the positions at which the car reaches certain points.
  - `b`: A list of k integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, representing the times at which the car reaches the corresponding points in `a`.
  - `d`: A list of q integers where 0 ≤ d ≤ n, representing the distances for each query.

The function processes each test case and, for each query `d`, returns the time at which the car reaches the distance `d`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `d`. For each test case, it returns the time at which the car reaches the specified distance `d` for each query.**
