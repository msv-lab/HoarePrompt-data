To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the transformations applied to the variables step by step.

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0.
- `t` remains the same.
- `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned new values from the input, where `q` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements.
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the input and must have at least `len(a) + 1` elements.
- `ad` is now `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`.
- `bd` is now `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `v` is now `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`.
- `m` is now `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- `ql` is now `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`.
- If `a[s]` is equal to the original `ql`, we continue to the next iteration.
- All other variables (`l`) retain their values as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of Lists and Variables:**
   - `a` and `b` are lists derived from input values.
   - `ad` and `bd` are lists of differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - `v` is a list of ratios of corresponding elements in `ad` and `bd`.

2. **Finding `s`:**
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`.

3. **Updating `m` and `ql`:**
   - `m` is updated using the formula `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
   - `ql` is updated using the formula `ql - a[s - 1]`.

4. **Printing `m`:**
   - The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer value of `m`.

### Final Output:
Given the complexity of the transformations and the lack of specific values for `a`, `b`, and `ql`, we can only describe the output in terms of the given formulas and conditions.

Output: **int(m) (where m is the updated value of m based on the given formula and conditions)**

This output reflects the integer value of `m` after it has been updated according to the specified formula and conditions.
