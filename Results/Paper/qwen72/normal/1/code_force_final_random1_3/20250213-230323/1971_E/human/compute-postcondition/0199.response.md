Let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement.

### Initial State:
1. `_` is 1 (This variable is not used in the subsequent operations).
2. `t` remains the same (This variable is not used in the subsequent operations).
3. `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned new values from the input where `q` must be greater than 2.
4. `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations.
5. `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements.
6. `ad` is now `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`.
7. `bd` is now `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`.
8. `i` is 1.
9. `v` is now `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`.
10. `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
11. `ql` is now `ql - a[s - 1]`.
12. `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`.
13. `l` is 2. If `a[s]` equals the original `ql`, the state remains unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine `s`:**
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`.

2. **Update `ql`:**
   - `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.

3. **Calculate `m`:**
   - `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following values for simplicity:
- `a = [0, 1, 3, 5]`
- `b = [0, 2, 4]`
- `ql = 4`

1. **Determine `s`:**
   - The first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to 4 is `a[2] = 3` (index 2).

2. **Update `ql`:**
   - `ql = 4 - a[2 - 1] = 4 - 1 = 3`.

3. **Calculate `ad` and `bd`:**
   - `ad = [0, 1 - 0, 3 - 1, 5 - 3] = [0, 1, 2, 2]`.
   - `bd = [0, 2 - 0, 4 - 2] = [0, 2, 2]`.

4. **Calculate `v`:**
   - `v = [0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ad[3] / bd[3]] = [0, 1 / 2, 2 / 2, 2 / 2] = [0, 0.5, 1, 1]`.

5. **Calculate `m`:**
   - `m = b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s] = b[2 - 1] + bd[2] * 3 / ad[2] = b[1] + 2 * 3 / 2 = 2 + 3 = 5`.

### Final Output:
The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer value of `m`.

Output: **5**
