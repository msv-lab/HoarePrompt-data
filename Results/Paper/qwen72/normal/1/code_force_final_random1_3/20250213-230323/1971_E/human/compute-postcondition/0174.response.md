Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` remains the same, `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned new values from the input where `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `ad` is now `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `bd` is now `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`, `i` is 1, `v` is now `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`, `ql` is now `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`, `l` is 0. If `a[s]` is exactly equal to the original `ql`, the current iteration ends and the loop continues to the next iteration.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged or retain their previously defined values.
