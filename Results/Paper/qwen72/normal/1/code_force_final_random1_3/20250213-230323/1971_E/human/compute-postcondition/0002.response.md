The code snippet `n, k, q = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n`, `k`, and `q` after converting them to integers.

- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `k` is assigned the second integer from the input.
- `q` is assigned the third integer from the input.

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration. These variables are not affected by the code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer.**
