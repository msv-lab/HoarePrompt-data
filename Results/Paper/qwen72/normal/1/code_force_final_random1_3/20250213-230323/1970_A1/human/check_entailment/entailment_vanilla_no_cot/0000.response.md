Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function is not directly used in the main logic but seems to be a comparison function that could be used for sorting. However, the actual sorting in `func_2` uses a lambda function, so this function is not necessary for the solution to work.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - It initializes the balance and an empty list `balance_info` to store the balance information for each character.
   - It iterates through the string `s`, updating the balance and appending a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info` for each character.
   - The `BalanceInfo` object stores the balance at the current position, the position itself, and the character.
   - After processing the entire string, it sorts the `balance_info` list based on the balance and, in case of ties, in decreasing order of position.
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list and prints it.

The program correctly follows the steps required to perform the balanced shuffle operation, ensuring that the output is the balanced shuffle of the input string. Therefore, the program is correct.
