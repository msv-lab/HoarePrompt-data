### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires implementing a balanced shuffle operation on a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The operation involves calculating the balance of each prefix, sorting the characters based on their balance and position, and then constructing the shuffled sequence.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Class Definition**:
     - The `BalanceInfo` class is defined to store the balance, position, and character of each prefix.
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function is used to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects for sorting.
     - It returns the difference in balance if the balances are different.
     - If the balances are the same, it returns the difference in positions in reverse order (i.e., higher positions come first).
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function processes the input string `s` to create a list of `BalanceInfo` objects.
     - It iterates through the string, updating the balance and appending `BalanceInfo` objects to the list.
     - After processing the string, it sorts the list using the `func_1` comparator.
     - Finally, it constructs the shuffled string from the sorted list and prints it.

3. **Annotated Code Verification**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - The `BalanceInfo` class is correctly initialized with the balance, position, and character.
   - **Processing**:
     - The loop correctly updates the balance and appends `BalanceInfo` objects to the list.
     - The final balance is 0, confirming that the input is a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - **Sorting**:
     - The sorting key is correctly defined to sort by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order for ties.
   - **Result Construction**:
     - The result string is correctly constructed by joining the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the input constraints (non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000).
   - The sorting logic ensures that the output is always a valid balanced parentheses sequence.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It accurately calculates the balance of each prefix, sorts the characters based on the specified criteria, and constructs the shuffled sequence. The program handles the input constraints and ensures that the output is the balanced shuffle of the input string.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
