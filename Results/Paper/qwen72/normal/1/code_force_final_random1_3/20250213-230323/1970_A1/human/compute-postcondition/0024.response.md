The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function processes this string and returns a value based on the input.

Since the specific output is not provided, I will assume that the function returns a boolean indicating whether the parentheses sequence is balanced (which, given the constraints, it always will be).
