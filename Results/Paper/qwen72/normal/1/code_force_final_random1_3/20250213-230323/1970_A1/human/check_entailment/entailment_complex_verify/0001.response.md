### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to perform a balanced shuffle operation on a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The balanced shuffle involves computing the balance of each prefix, sorting the characters based on their balance and position, and then constructing the new sequence from the sorted characters.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - **Class `BalanceInfo`:**
     - This class is used to store the balance, position, and character for each position in the input string.
     - It is correctly implemented and serves its purpose.

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function is intended to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position.
     - It returns the difference in balance if the balances are different.
     - If the balances are the same, it returns the difference in positions in reverse order (i.e., higher positions come first).
     - However, this function is not actually used in the main logic of the program. The sorting is done using a lambda function in `func_2`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function takes a string `s` as input.
     - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
     - It iterates over the string `s`, computing the balance at each position and appending a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info`.
     - After computing all balances, it sorts the `balance_info` list based on the balance and position (using the lambda function).
     - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list and prints it.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The balance is correctly computed by incrementing for '(' and decrementing for ')'.
   - The sorting logic is correct: it sorts by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order when balances are equal.
   - The construction of the result string from the sorted list is correct.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the input constraints (non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with length up to 500,000) efficiently.
   - The sorting step is efficient enough for the given constraints.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.
   - The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
**True**
