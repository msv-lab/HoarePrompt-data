Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; n is the length of s; balance_info is an empty list; balance is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
    if s[i] == '(':
        balance += 1
    else:
        balance -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `balance_info` is a list containing one element, which is a `BalanceInfo` object with `i` set to 0 and `s[i]` set to the first character of `s`. If the first character of `s` is '(', then `balance` is set to 1. If the first character of `s` is ')', then `balance` is set to -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1; `balance_info` is a list containing two elements, each a `BalanceInfo` object. The first `BalanceInfo` object has `i` set to 1, `s[i]` set to the second character of `s`, and `balance` set to 3 if the second character of `s` is '(', or set to -1 if the second character of `s` is ')'. The second `BalanceInfo` object has `i` set to 1, `s[i]` set to the second character of `s`, and `balance` set to the same value as the first `BalanceInfo` object's `balance`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2; `balance_info` is a list containing three `BalanceInfo` objects, each with `i` set to 2, `s[i]` set to the third character of `s`. If the third character of `s` is '(', the `balance` of each `BalanceInfo` object is set to 4. If the third character of `s` is ')', the `balance` of each `BalanceInfo` object is set to -2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
