Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `aOnes` < `bOnes`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1.***
