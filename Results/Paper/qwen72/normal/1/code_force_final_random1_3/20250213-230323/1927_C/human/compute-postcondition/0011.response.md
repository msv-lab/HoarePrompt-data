Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, the current value of `i` (which is 1) is present in both lists `a` and `b`. The number of ones in list `a` (`aOnes`) is less than the number of ones in list `b` (`bOnes`).**
