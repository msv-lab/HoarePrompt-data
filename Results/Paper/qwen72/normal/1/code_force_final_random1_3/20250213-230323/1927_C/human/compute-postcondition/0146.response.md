Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `t` is `t + 1`, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `b` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, and `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
