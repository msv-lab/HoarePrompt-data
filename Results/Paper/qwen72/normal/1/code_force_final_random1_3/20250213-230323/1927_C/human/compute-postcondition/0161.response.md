- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `t` is incremented by 1.
- `a` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `b` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input.
- `newk` is set to `k // 2`.
- `i` is set to `k + 1`.
- `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both set to `newk`.

None of these variables or their values are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement only outputs the string `'yes'`.
