Postcondition: ***`t` is incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `b` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`, and if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
