Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, the current value of `i` (which is 1) is present in both lists `a` and `b`. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 0. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1.***
