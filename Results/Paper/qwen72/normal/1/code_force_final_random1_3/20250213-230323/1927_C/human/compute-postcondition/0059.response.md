Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `b` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is the number of elements in the updated `b` that are also in the new `a` and meet the condition `bOnes < aOnes` up to `newk`. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.**
