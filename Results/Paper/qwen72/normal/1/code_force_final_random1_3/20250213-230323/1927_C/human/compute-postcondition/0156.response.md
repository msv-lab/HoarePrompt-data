Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `t` is `t + 1`, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `b` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3, and `k` is greater than or equal to 3. If `i` (which is 3) is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `i` (which is 3) is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. If neither of these conditions is met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
