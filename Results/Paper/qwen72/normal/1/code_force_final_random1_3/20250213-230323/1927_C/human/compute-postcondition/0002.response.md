The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
