Postcondition: ***`t` is incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `b` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3, and `k` is greater than or equal to 4. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
