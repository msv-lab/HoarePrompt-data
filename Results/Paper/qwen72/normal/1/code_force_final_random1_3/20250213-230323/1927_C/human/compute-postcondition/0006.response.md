Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `newk` is assigned the value of `k` divided by 2 using integer division (`//`). All other variables remain unchanged.
