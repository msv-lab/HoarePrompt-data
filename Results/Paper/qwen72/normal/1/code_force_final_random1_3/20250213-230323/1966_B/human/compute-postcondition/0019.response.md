Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is 1, `impossible` is False.**

Explanation:
- The variable `impossible` is explicitly set to `False`.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`, `j`) retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
- The condition about the first character of the first string in `gr` being different from the last character of the last string in `gr` remains unchanged.
- The condition about the first character of the first string in `gr` being different from the second character of the first string in `gr`, or the first character of the last string in `gr` being different from the second character of the last string in `gr`, remains unchanged. However, `impossible` is now explicitly set to `False`.
