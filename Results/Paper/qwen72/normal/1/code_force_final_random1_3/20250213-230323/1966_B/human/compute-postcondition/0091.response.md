The code snippet `gr = []` reassigns the variable `gr` to an empty list. This overrides the previous value of `gr`, which was a list containing `n` input strings. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `False`.**
