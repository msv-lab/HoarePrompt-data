The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by a grid of dimensions `n` x `m` filled with characters 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, it checks if the top-left corner cell (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner cell (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) are the same color. If they are different, it further checks if all rows and columns have consistent colors except possibly the corners. If these conditions are met, the function prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
