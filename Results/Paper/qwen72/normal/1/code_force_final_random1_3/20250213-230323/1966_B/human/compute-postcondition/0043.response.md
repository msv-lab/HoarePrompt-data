Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, and `ans` is 'YES'. If `gr[0][0]` is different from `gr[n-1][m-1]`, then `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is 'NO', and if `impossible` is `True`, the program maintains all these conditions. If `impossible` is `False`, the program also maintains all these conditions, but `impossible` is `False`, indicating that at least one pair of consecutive strings in `gr` has a different first character or a different last character. If `gr[0][0]` is the same as `gr[n-1][m-1]`, then the program maintains the original conditions with `ans` still being 'YES'.***
