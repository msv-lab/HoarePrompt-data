The code snippet sets the variable `impossible` to `True`. This changes the state of `impossible` from its initial value (which was `False`) to `True`. The value of `ans` is updated to 'NO' because the condition `if impossible is True` is now satisfied. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, the first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is `m-2`, `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is 'NO'.**
