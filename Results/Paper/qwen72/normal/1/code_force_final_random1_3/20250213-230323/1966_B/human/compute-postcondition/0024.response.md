Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is `m-2`. If any pair of consecutive characters in the first string of `gr` or the last string of `gr` are different, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `m-1` times, so after all iterations, `j` will be `m-2`.
- The condition inside the loop checks if any consecutive characters in the first string (`gr[0]`) or the last string (`gr[n-1]`) are different.
- If any such pair is found, `impossible` is set to `False`.
- If no such pair is found throughout all iterations, `impossible` remains `True`.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `i`, `ans`, and the initial condition about the first and last characters) remain unchanged.
