Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value 'YES' to the variable `ans`. Since `ans` was already set to 'YES' in the initial state, there is no change in the state of the program. All other variables remain unchanged.
