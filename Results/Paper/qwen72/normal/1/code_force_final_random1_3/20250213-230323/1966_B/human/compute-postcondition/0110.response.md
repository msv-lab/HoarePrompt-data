Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is greater than 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 'YES', `j` is 2, the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `impossible` is `False`.** 

The variable `impossible` is initialized to `False`, and no other variables are affected by this initialization. Therefore, all other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
