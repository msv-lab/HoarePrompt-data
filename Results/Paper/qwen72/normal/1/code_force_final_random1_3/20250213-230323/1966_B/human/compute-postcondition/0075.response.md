Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is 0, `j` is `m - 1`, `impossible` is `False`, `ans` is 'YES', and either the first character of the string at index `i` in `gr` is different from the first character of the string at index `i + 1` in `gr`, or the last character of the string at index `i` in `gr` is different from the last character of the string at index `i + 1` in `gr`.**

Explanation: The variable `impossible` was initially `True` and is now set to `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
