Output State: **t is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500), representing the dimensions of the grid, followed by n lines each containing m characters ('W' or 'B'), representing the initial colors of the grid. The total number of cells across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
