Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, the first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is 'NO'. If any pair of consecutive strings in `gr` has a different first character or a different last character, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-2` (inclusive), so after all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`.
- The condition inside the loop checks if the first character or the last character of consecutive strings in the list `gr` are different. If any such pair is found, `impossible` is set to `False`.
- If no such pair is found throughout the entire loop, `impossible` remains `True`.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `j`, `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
