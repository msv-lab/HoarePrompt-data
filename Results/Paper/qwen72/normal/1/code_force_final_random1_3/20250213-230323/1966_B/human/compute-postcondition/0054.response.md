Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `False`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, appending one input string to the list `gr` in each iteration.
- After `n` iterations, the list `gr` will contain exactly `n` input strings.
- The variable `i` starts at `n-1` and is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
- The variables `t`, `tc`, `m`, `ans`, and `impossible` are not modified within the loop, so they retain their initial values.
- Therefore, after the loop completes, `gr` will be a list of `n` strings, `i` will be `n-1`, and `ans` will still be 'YES' with `impossible` remaining `False`.
