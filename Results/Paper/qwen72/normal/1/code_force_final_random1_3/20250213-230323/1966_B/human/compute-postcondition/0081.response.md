The code snippet sets the variable `impossible` to `False`. This changes the state of `impossible` from its previous condition (which was not explicitly defined but could have been `True` or `False`) to `False`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is 2, `j` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `False`.**
