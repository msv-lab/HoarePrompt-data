Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `True`. Additionally, either the character at position `j` in the first string of `gr` is different from the character at position `j + 1` in the same string, or the character at position `j` in the last string of `gr` is different from the character at position `j + 1` in the same string.**
