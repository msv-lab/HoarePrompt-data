Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is 0, the first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is 'NO'. If `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.***
