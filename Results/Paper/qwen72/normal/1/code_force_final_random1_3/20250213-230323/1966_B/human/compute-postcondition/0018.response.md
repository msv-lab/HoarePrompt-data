The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the expression `m - 1`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The condition `m - 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is 1. If the first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the second character of the first string in `gr`, or the first character of the last string in `gr` is different from the second character of the last string in `gr`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.**
