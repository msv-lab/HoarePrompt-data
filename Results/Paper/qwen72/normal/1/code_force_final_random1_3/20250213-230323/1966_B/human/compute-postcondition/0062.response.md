The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j`, `m`, and the implicit condition that `j` must be less than `m - 1` for the loop to execute.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m - 2` (since the loop iterates from `0` to `m - 2`). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `m - 1`. However, for the loop to actually execute, `j` must still be less than `m - 1`. Therefore, `m` must be greater than `j + 1`, which means `m` must be greater than `m - 1`.

Given that `m` must be greater than 1, and `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the new state is:

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `j` is `m - 1`, `impossible` is `False` if the conditions in the problem statement are met, otherwise `impossible` remains `True`**. 

However, since `j` is now `m - 1`, the loop will not execute again because `j` is no longer less than `m - 1`. Thus, the loop will terminate.
