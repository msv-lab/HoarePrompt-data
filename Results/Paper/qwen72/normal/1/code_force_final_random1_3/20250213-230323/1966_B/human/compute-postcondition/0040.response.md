Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, the first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is 'NO', and `impossible` is `True`.** 

This postcondition includes all the conditions from the precondition and adds the condition that `impossible` is `True` as specified by the if condition.
