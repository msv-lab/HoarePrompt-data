Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `j` is `m - 1`, `impossible` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `impossible` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this update while keeping all other initial conditions intact.
