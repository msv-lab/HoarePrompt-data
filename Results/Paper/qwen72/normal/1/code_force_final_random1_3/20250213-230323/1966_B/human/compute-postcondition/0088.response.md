Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `tc` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `ans` is 'YES'.
   - `impossible` is `False`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is set to 'NO'.
   - If `impossible` is `True` (because at least one pair of consecutive strings in `gr` has different first or last characters), `ans` is set to 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.

3. **Determine the Value of `ans`:**
   - We need to check the two conditions:
     - `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`: This checks if the first character of the first string is different from the last character of the last string.
     - `impossible` is `True`: This indicates that there is at least one pair of consecutive strings in `gr` with different first or last characters.

4. **Possible Outcomes:**
   - If either of these conditions is true, `ans` will be set to 'NO'.
   - If neither of these conditions is true, `ans` will remain 'YES'.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the value of `ans` will be determined as follows:
- If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]` or `impossible` is `True`, then `ans` will be 'NO'.
- Otherwise, `ans` will be 'YES'.

Since the exact values of `gr`, `n`, and `m` are not provided, we cannot definitively determine the exact outcome. However, based on the given conditions, the print statement will output the value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is 'YES' if neither `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]` nor `impossible` is `True`, otherwise 'NO')**
