The function `func` is designed to process multiple test cases, where each test case involves a grid of dimensions `n` x `m` filled with characters 'W' or 'B'. The function accepts no direct parameters but reads input data structured as follows:

- The first input is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500), representing the dimensions of the grid.
  - This is followed by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters ('W' or 'B'), representing the initial state of the grid.

The function processes each test case and returns the result for each test case. However, the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case includes a grid of dimensions `n` x `m` filled with 'W' or 'B'. It reads the input for each test case and returns the result for each test case.**
