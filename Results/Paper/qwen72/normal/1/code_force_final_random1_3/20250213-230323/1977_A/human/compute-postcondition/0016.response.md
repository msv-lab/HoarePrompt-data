Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, and `n` is not equal to `m`.
- `m` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.
- Both `m` and `n` are odd integers.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This `print` statement simply prints the string `'Yes'` to the console. The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or conditions.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Yes**
