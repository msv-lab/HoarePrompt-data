The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`) but does not influence the content of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of these variables and simply prints the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
