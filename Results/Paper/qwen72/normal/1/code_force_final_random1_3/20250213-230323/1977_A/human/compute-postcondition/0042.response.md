Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- The parity (even or odd) of `n` and `m` is determined by the input values.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This code snippet simply prints the string `'Yes'`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Yes**
