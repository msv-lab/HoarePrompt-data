Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where `n` is odd and `m` is even, or vice versa, but `n >= m`. For example, consider the input `(n=5, m=2)`:

- According to the problem, it is possible to achieve a tower of 2 cubes after 5 moves. One way to do this is:
  - Add a cube (1)
  - Add a cube (2)
  - Remove a cube (1)
  - Add a cube (2)
  - Remove a cube (1)

However, the program incorrectly outputs "No" for this case because it checks `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:` and `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:` which are not sufficient conditions to determine the possibility of achieving the desired tower height. The correct condition should be simply checking if `n >= m`, as any number of moves greater than or equal to the desired number of cubes can always result in the desired tower height by adding and removing cubes appropriately.
