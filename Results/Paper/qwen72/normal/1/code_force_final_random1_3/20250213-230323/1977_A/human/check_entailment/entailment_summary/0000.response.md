Reasoning:

The program aims to determine whether, after `n` moves, a tower can have exactly `m` cubes. The logic implemented in the program checks several conditions to decide if this is possible:

1. **If `n` equals `m`:**
   - This means Nikita can simply add `m` cubes one by one, which is always possible. Hence, the output is 'Yes'.

2. **If `m` is greater than `n`:**
   - It's impossible to have more cubes (`m`) than the number of moves (`n`), so the output is 'No'.

3. **If `m` is `n - 1`:**
   - This means Nikita can add `n` cubes and then remove one, leaving `m` cubes. Hence, the output is 'Yes'.

4. **If both `m` and `n` are even:**
   - If both `m` and `n` are even, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes in such a way that the parity (evenness or oddness) remains consistent. Hence, the output is 'Yes'.

5. **If both `m` and `n` are odd:**
   - Similarly, if both `m` and `n` are odd, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes by ensuring the parity remains consistent. Hence, the output is 'Yes'.

6. **Otherwise:**
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it's not possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves, so the output is 'No'.

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1: `n = 3`, `m = 3`**
  - `n` equals `m`, so the output is 'Yes'.

- **Test Case 2: `n = 2`, `m = 4`**
  - `m` is greater than `n`, so the output is 'No'.

- **Test Case 3: `n = 5`, `m = 3`**
  - Both `m` and `n` are odd, so the output is 'Yes'.

The program correctly handles all these cases and produces the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
