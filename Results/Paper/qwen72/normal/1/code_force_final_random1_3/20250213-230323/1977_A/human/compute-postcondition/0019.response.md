Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 0. `i` is 0. `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, and `n` is not equal to `m`. Additionally, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `m` is not equal to `n - 1`. If both `m` and `n` are odd integers, then both remain odd. Otherwise, either `m` is even, or `n` is even, or both, while still maintaining the conditions that `m` is less than or equal to `n` and `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.***
