The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides several details about the variables and their conditions:
  - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 2.
  - `i` is set to 2.
  - `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
  - The parity (even or odd) of `n` and `m` is determined by the input values.

However, none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`.

Output: **Yes**
