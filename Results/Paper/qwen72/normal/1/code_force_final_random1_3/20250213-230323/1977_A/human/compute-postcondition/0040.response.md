The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- The parity (even or odd) of `n` and `m` is determined by the input values.

However, none of these variables or their values are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **No**
