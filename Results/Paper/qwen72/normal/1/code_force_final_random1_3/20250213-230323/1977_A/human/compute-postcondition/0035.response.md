Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 1; `i` is 1; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. If `m` is greater than `n`, the relationship `m > n` holds true, and the parity (even or odd) of `m` and `n` remains unchanged. If `m` is not greater than `n`, then `m` can be less than `n` or equal to `n - 1`. If `m` is equal to `n - 1`, then `m` is exactly one less than `n`, and the parity (even or odd) of `m` and `n` remains unchanged. If `m` is less than `n` but not equal to `n - 1`, the relationship `m < n` holds true, and the parity (even or odd) of `m` and `n` remains unchanged.***
