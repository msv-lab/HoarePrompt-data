Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, each grid is a list of `n` strings, each string containing `n` characters ('0' or '1'), the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1', `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list if the string representation of `b` does not contain '1', otherwise `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in the string representation of `b`, and `b` is a positive integer input by the user.***
