You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid. Each grid is represented by a list of n strings, each string containing n characters ('0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.

    #State: The loop counter `i` is equal to `a`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `k` is a list that may contain multiple counts of '1's from each input string `b` that contained at least one '1' during the iterations. The variable `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` remains an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, and the grid remains a list of `n` strings, each string containing `n` characters ('0' or '1'). The grid still contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'. The variable `a` is now 0, as it has been decremented by the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it only checks the first two rows of the grid to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle. This approach fails for several scenarios:

1. **Upside-down Triangle**: The program does not account for an upside-down triangle. For example, consider the following grid:
   ```
   0000
   0000
   1110
   0100
   ```
   This is an upside-down triangle, but the program will incorrectly identify it as a triangle because it only checks the first two rows.

2. **Non-central Triangles**: The program assumes that the central 1s are located in one column, but it does not verify this. For example, consider the following grid:
   ```
   0000
   0100
   0110
   0111
   ```
   This is a valid triangle, but the program will incorrectly identify it as a square because it only checks the number of 1s in the first two rows.

3. **Non-square Shapes with Equal First Two Rows**: The program will incorrectly identify shapes that have the same number of 1s in the first two rows but are not squares. For example, consider the following grid:
   ```
   0000
   1100
   1100
   0000
   ```
   This is not a square, but the program will incorrectly identify it as a square.

To ensure the program is correct, it needs to verify the entire grid and check for both the structure of a triangle and a square, including handling upside-down triangles and ensuring the central 1s are aligned correctly.
