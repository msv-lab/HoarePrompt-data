The code snippet `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of the character '1' in the string `b` to the list `k`. Since the initial state specifies that `b` is the user input and contains the character '1', the number of '1's in `b` is counted and added to the list `k`.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder for the loop counter, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, `b` is the user input and contains the character '1', `k` now includes the count of '1's in `b`.**
