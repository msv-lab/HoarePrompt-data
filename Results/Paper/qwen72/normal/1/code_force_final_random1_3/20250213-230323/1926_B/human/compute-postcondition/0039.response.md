Based on the initial state provided:

- The loop counter `_` has reached the value of `int(input())`, which indicates the number of iterations specified at the beginning.
- The variable `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from each input string `b` that contained at least one '1'.
- The variable `i` remains 1, and `a` remains greater than 1 as they were not modified within the loop.
- Additionally, the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`.

Given this information, the `print` statement is simply printing the string `'SQUARE'`.

Output: **SQUARE**
