Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10.
- Each grid is a list of `n` strings, each string containing `n` characters ('0' or '1').
- The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.
- `a` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's in the string representations of `b` for each iteration where '1' was found in `b`.
- The first two elements of `k` are equal (`k[0] == k[1]`).

Given these conditions, the key point is that the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's. Since the first two elements of `k` are equal (`k[0] == k[1]`), this suggests that the counts of '1's in the first two iterations are the same. This is more consistent with a square shape rather than a triangle, as a triangle would typically have different counts of '1's in consecutive rows.

Therefore, the code snippet:
```python
print('SQUARE')
```
will print the string 'SQUARE'.

Output: **SQUARE**
