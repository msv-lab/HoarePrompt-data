Based on the initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10.
- Each grid is a list of `n` strings, each string containing `n` characters ('0' or '1').
- The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.
- `a` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's in the string representations of `b` for each iteration where '1' was found in `b`.
- Additionally, `k[0]` is not equal to `k[1]`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('TRIANGLE')
```

This code snippet simply prints the string `'TRIANGLE'`. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **TRIANGLE**
