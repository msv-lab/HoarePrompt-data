The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the given signature, but based on the problem description, it implicitly accepts the following parameters:

- An integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid.
- A list of `n` strings, each string containing `n` characters ('0' or '1'), representing the grid.

The function processes each test case to determine if the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'. The function returns the type of shape found for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a grid of `n` x `n` characters ('0' or '1'). It returns the type of shape (triangle or square) that includes all the '1's in the grid, ensuring the shape does not consist of exactly one '1'.**
