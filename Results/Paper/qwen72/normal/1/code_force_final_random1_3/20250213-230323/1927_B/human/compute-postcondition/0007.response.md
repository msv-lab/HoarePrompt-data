Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers derived from the input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing the letter corresponding to the count of the first element in `rev_array` in the sublist starting from the first element, `j` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a letter from the `alp` list to the `ans` list.
- The index used to select the letter from `alp` is calculated as the count of the first element in `rev_array` in the sublist starting from the first element, minus 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `l`, `array`, `alp`, `rev_array`, `j`) remain unchanged.
