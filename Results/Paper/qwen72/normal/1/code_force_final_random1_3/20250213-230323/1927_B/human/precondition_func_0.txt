t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the lost string. a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
