The code snippet `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `array`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 1
- `l` is an input integer greater than 0
- `array` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'
- `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`
- `ans` is a list of length `l` where each element corresponds to the letter in `alp` based on the count of the respective element in `rev_array` starting from that index
- `j` is `l-1`

After executing the code snippet:
- `array` is updated to a new list of integers derived from the input.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of the new `array`, `ans` is a list of length `l` where each element corresponds to the letter in `alp` based on the count of the respective element in the new `rev_array` starting from that index, `j` is `l-1`.**
