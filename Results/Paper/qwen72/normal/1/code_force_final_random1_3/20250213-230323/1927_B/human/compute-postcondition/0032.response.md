Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing `l` elements where each element is the letter corresponding to the count of the respective element in `rev_array` minus 1 in the alphabet, `j` is `l-1`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'.**

Explanation:
- The code `rev_array = array[::-1]` reverses the `array` and assigns the result to `rev_array`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `l`, `array`, `ans`, `j`, `int(input())`, `alp`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.
