Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list of characters where each character corresponds to the count of the respective element in `rev_array` minus 1, mapped to the alphabet, `j` is `l`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `l` is still the input integer greater than 0.
- The `array` remains a list of integers derived from the input.
- The `rev_array` is still the reversed version of `array`.
- The `ans` list now contains characters from the alphabet, where each character corresponds to the count of the respective element in `rev_array` minus 1, starting from the end of `rev_array` and moving towards the beginning.
- The value of `j` is now equal to `l`.
- The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
- The `alp` list still contains the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'.
