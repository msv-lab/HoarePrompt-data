Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is an empty list, `j` is `l-1`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans = []` initializes the variable `ans` as an empty list.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `l`, `array`, `alp`, `rev_array`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
