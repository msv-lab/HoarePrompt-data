You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `t-1`, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers derived from the last input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list of characters where each character corresponds to the count of the respective element in `rev_array` minus 1, mapped to the alphabet, `j` is `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. The function processes each test case to generate a string based on the counts of elements in the reversed list, mapping these counts to corresponding characters from the alphabet. After processing all test cases, the function prints the resulting strings for each test case. The final state of the program includes the processed test cases being outputted, with no modifications to the initial inputs or any other global state.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This is done using a loop that iterates `int(input())` times.

2. **Array Reading**: For each test case, it reads the length of the trace array `l` and the trace array itself, converting the input into a list of integers.

3. **Alphabet Initialization**: The function initializes a list `alp` containing all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z'. This list will be used to map the counts to specific characters.

4. **Reversing the Array**: The trace array `array` is reversed to facilitate the counting process. This is a crucial step because the problem requires counting occurrences of elements before the current index, and reversing the array allows us to count occurrences from the end of the array.

5. **Constructing the Answer**: The function constructs the answer string by iterating through the reversed array. For each element in the reversed array, it counts how many times that element appears in the remaining part of the array (from the current position to the end). This count is then used to index into the `alp` list to select the corresponding character.

6. **Character Selection**: The character selection logic is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`. This ensures that the character selected is the one that has appeared the required number of times before the current position in the original (non-reversed) array.

7. **Output**: The constructed answer is printed as a string.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Reversing the Array**: Reversing the array is a clever way to handle the counting of previous occurrences. By counting from the end, we can easily determine the number of times a value has appeared before the current position in the original array.
- **Counting Occurrences**: The use of `rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j])` is efficient for small arrays but may become inefficient for larger arrays due to the repeated counting operation. However, given the constraints, this approach is acceptable.
- **Character Mapping**: The mapping from counts to characters is done correctly using the `alp` list.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly reconstructs a string that matches the given trace for each test case. The logic is sound and handles the problem requirements effectively.

### Final Verdict:
Correctness: **True**
