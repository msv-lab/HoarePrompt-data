To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. **Variable `i`:** This variable is automatically managed by the `range` function and starts from 0 by default.
2. **Result of `int(input())`:** This represents the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, this value must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the lost string.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, representing the trace of the string.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

We need to ensure that the input provided to the loop (which should be `t`) is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
