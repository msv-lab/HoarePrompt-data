Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is an empty list, `j` is `l-1`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(l):
    ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `l` must be greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is a letter from the alphabet corresponding to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist `rev_array[j:]` minus 1, `j` is `l-1`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `l` must be greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` now contains the original element plus the new character from the `alp` list, `j` is `l`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `l` must be greater than 2, `array` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` now contains the original elements plus the new character from the `alp` list, which is the letter corresponding to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist `rev_array[j:]` minus 1, `j` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
