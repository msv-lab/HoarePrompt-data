Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is a placeholder, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s[:n-1]`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s[:n-1]`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where the conditions were met during the loop. Otherwise, `lst` contains only those indices where the conditions were met.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and an element `ele` from `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s[:n-1]`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s[:n-1]`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` must contain at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and the current `ele` from `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s[:n-1]`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s[:n-1]`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` must contain at least two elements, `ele` is the next element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and the next `ele` from `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s[:n-1]`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s[:n-1]`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` must contain at least three elements, `ele` is the next element in `lst`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the current `ele`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
