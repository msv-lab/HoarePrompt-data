Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a binary string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it determines the optimal position `i` to place a road such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side, and `i` is as close to the middle of the village as possible. The function prints the optimal position for each test case. If no such position exists, it prints the position that maximizes the satisfaction of the majority, either at the start (0) or the end (`n`) of the village. **
