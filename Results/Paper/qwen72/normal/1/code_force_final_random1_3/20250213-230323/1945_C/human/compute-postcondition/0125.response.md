Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of the original `mini` and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of times '0' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of times '1' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` must contain at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `lst`, and `final` is a list containing `elem` regardless of the condition.**

Explanation:
- The code `final.append(elem)` appends the second element of `lst` to the list `final`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The condition that `final` should only contain `elem` if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini` is ignored, and `elem` is appended to `final` regardless.
