Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of times '0' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of times '1' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` is a list containing all indices `i + 1` where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, and `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, and if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes `0` as its last element. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` includes `n` as its last element. If `len(final) != 0`, `final` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of the original `mini` and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of times '0' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of times '1' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` is a list containing at least one element, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, and if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes `0` as its last element. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` includes `n` as its last element. If `len(final) != 0`, `final` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of the original `mini` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the previous `ele`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of times '0' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of times '1' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` is a list containing at least two elements, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, and if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes `0` as its last element. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` includes `n` as its last element. If `len(final) != 0`, `final` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of the original `mini` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the current `ele`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of times '0' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of times '1' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` is a list containing at least three elements, `ele` is the next element in `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, and if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes `0` as its last element. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` includes `n` as its last element. If `len(final) != 0`, `final` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
