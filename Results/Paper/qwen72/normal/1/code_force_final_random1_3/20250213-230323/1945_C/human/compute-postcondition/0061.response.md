Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s[:n-1]`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s[:n-1]`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` is a list containing all indices `i + 1` where the conditions were met during the loop, `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in `lst`.
- For each element `elem` in `lst`, it checks if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.
- If the condition is true, `elem` is appended to the `final` list.
- After the loop completes, `final` will contain all elements from `lst` that satisfy the condition.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
