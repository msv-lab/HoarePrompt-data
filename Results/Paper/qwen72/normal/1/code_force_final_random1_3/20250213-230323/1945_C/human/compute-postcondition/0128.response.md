Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of the original `mini` and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of times '0' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of times '1' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` must contain at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in `lst`, `final` is a list containing `elem`.**

Explanation: The code appends the third element of `lst` to the list `final`. All other variables remain unchanged. The new state reflects that `final` now contains `elem`.
