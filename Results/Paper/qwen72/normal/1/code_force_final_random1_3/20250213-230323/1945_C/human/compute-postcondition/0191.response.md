Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the processed part of `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the remaining part of `s`, `lst` contains at least one element, `mini` is the minimum of its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, and `final` remain unchanged, except `final` is now an empty list. Additionally, the absolute difference between `pk` and the current element `elem` in `lst` is equal to `mini`.**
