Output State: **_ is a placeholder, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s[:n-1]`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s[:n-1]`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where the conditions were met during the loop. Otherwise, `lst` contains only those indices where the conditions were met.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n - 1` times, updating the counts of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[:i+1]`.
- After each iteration, it calculates the percentage of '0's and '1's seen so far (`zero_perc` and `one_perc`).
- If both percentages are at least 50%, the current index `i + 1` is added to the list `lst`.
- At the end of the loop, `i` will be `n - 2`, `zero` will be the count of '0's in `s[:n-1]`, and `one` will be the count of '1's in `s[:n-1]`.
- The final `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the first `n - 1` characters, and `one_perc` is the percentage of remaining '1's in the last character.
- The list `lst` will contain all indices where the conditions were met during the loop.
