Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in how it calculates the satisfaction of residents on both sides of the road. Specifically, the program uses percentages (`zero_perc` and `one_perc`) to check if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied, but this approach is incorrect because it does not account for the requirement that at least \(\lceil \frac{x}{2} \rceil\) residents on each side must be satisfied, where \(x\) is the number of residents on that side.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
01010
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
The program might output a different value, such as `3`, because it incorrectly uses percentages to determine satisfaction.

**Explanation:**
- For the road after the 2nd house:
  - Left side: `01` (2 houses, 1 resident wants to live on the left, which is \(\lceil \frac{2}{2} \rceil = 1\)).
  - Right side: `010` (3 houses, 2 residents want to live on the right, which is \(\lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2\)).

This satisfies the condition, and the road should be placed after the 2nd house. However, the program's percentage-based logic might fail to correctly identify this.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
