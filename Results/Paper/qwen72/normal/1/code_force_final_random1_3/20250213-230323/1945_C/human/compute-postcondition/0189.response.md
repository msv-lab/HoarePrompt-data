Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the processed part of `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the remaining part of `s`, `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%, `mini` is the minimum of its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. The values of `n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, and `final` remain unchanged, except `final` is now an empty list.**
