The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `n - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the condition `i < n - 1` to hold true.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is 0, `one_perc` is `n * 100 // (n - 1)` if the first character of `s` is '0'. If the first character of `s` is not '0': `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is 100. If `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, `lst` is [1].**
