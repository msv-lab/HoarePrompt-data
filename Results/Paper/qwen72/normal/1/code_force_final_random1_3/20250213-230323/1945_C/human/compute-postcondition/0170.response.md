To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1
- If `s[i]` is '0':
  - `zero` is 2
  - `zero_perc` is 200 // 2 = 100
  - `one` is 0
  - `one_perc` is `n * 100 // (n - 1)` if the first character of `s` is '0'
- If the first character of `s` is not '0':
  - `one` is 1
  - `zero_perc` is 0
  - `one_perc` is 100
- If `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, `lst` is [1]
- If `s[i]` is not '0':
  - `zero` is 1
  - `zero_perc` is 100 // 2 = 50
  - `one` is 1 or 2
  - `one_perc` is `n * 100 // (n - 1)` if the first character of `s` is '0'
- If the first character of `s` is not '0':
  - `one` is 2
  - `zero_perc` is 0
  - `one_perc` is 100
- If `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, `lst` is [1]

### Code Snippet:
```python
one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `o` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it is a typo and should be `one`.
- The code updates the value of `one_perc` using the formula `(one - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.
- Since `one - one` is 0, the expression simplifies to `0 * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, which results in `0`.

### Updated Variables:
- `one_perc` is now 0.

### Output State:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1
- If `s[i]` is '0':
  - `zero` is 2
  - `zero_perc` is 100
  - `one` is 0
  - `one_perc` is 0
- If the first character of `s` is not '0':
  - `one` is 1
  - `zero_perc` is 0
  - `one_perc` is 0
- If `s[i]` is not '0':
  - `zero` is 1
  - `zero_perc` is 50
  - `one` is 1 or 2
  - `one_perc` is 0
- If the first character of `s` is not '0':
  - `one` is 2
  - `zero_perc` is 0
  - `one_perc` is 0
- If `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, `lst` is [1]

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `one_perc` is 0. If `s[i]` is '0': `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is 0. If the first character of `s` is not '0': `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 0. If `s[i]` is not '0': `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 50, `one` is 1 or 2. If the first character of `s` is not '0': `one` is 2, `zero_perc` is 0. If `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, `lst` is [1].**
