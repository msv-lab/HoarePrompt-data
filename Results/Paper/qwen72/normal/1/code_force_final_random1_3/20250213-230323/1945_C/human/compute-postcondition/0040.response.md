The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given the initial state, let's determine the updated state:

- `i` is 2.
- `lst` is initially [1, 2] if the conditions `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` are met, otherwise it is an empty list.

If `lst` is [1, 2]:
- `i + 1` is 3.
- After appending, `lst` becomes [1, 2, 3].

If `lst` is an empty list:
- `i + 1` is 3.
- After appending, `lst` becomes [3].

Therefore, the output state depends on whether `lst` was initially [1, 2] or an empty list. However, since the initial state specifies that `lst` is [1, 2] if the conditions are met, we will assume `lst` is [1, 2].

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 2, if `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is 2 and `one` is 0, if `s[i]` is '1', `zero` is 1 and `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 3`, `one_perc` is \((o - one) * 100 // (n - 3)\), if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is [1, 2, 3], otherwise `lst` is [3].**
