Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `lst` is an empty list, `t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a new input string, `sl` is a list of characters from the new `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is \(10^8\), `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If the length of `final` is 0, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, and if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes the element 0. Otherwise, `final` includes the value `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *If the first character of `s` is '0': `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is 0, `one_perc` is `n * 100 // (n - 1)`. If the first character of `s` is not '0': `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is 100. If `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, `lst` is [1].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `one_perc` is 0. If `s[i]` is '0': `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is 0. If the first character of `s` is not '0': `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 0. If `s[i]` is not '0' and `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 50, `one` is 1 or 2, and `lst` is [1, 2]. Otherwise, `lst` remains [1].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `one_perc` is 0, `zero` is 3 if `s[i]` is '0' or 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', `zero_perc` is 100 if `s[i]` is '0' or 33 if `s[i]` is not '0', `one` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0' or 2 if `s[i]` is not '0'. If `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, `lst` is [1, 3] if `s[i]` is '0' or [1, 2, 3] if `s[i]` is not '0'. Otherwise, `lst` remains [1].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
