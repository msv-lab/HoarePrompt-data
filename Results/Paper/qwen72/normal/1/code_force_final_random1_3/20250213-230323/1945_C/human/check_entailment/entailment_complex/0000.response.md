Reasoning:

The function `func` is designed to solve the problem as described. It iterates through each test case, reads the input values, and calculates the optimal position `i` to place the road. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `s` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Middle Position Calculation**:
   - The variable `pk` is set to `n / 2` regardless of whether `n` is even or odd. This is correct because the goal is to find the position closest to the middle of the village.

3. **Counting Preferences**:
   - The function converts the string `s` to a list `sl` and counts the number of '1's (`o`) and '0's (`z`).

4. **Iterating Through Possible Positions**:
   - The function iterates through possible positions `i` (from 0 to `n-1`).
   - For each position, it updates the counts of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the road.
   - It calculates the percentage of '0's on the left side and '1's on the right side.
   - If both percentages are at least 50%, the position `i + 1` is added to the list `lst`.

5. **Finding the Optimal Position**:
   - The function finds the position in `lst` that is closest to `pk`.
   - If no valid position is found, it checks the overall satisfaction:
     - If more than half of the residents prefer the right side, it sets the position to 0.
     - Otherwise, it sets the position to `n`.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the optimal position for each test case.

The logic and steps implemented in the function align with the problem requirements. The function correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, ensuring that the optimal position is found and printed for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
