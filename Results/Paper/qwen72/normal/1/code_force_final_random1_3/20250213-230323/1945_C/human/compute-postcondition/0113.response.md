Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of the original `mini` and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of times '0' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of times '1' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` is a list containing at least one element, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, and if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes `0` as its last element. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` includes `n` as its last element. If `len(final) != 0`, `final` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
