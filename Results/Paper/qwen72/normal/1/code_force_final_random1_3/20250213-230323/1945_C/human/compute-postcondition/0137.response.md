The code snippet `final.append(n)` adds the value of `n` to the list `final`. Given that the initial state specifies that `final` is a sorted list and its length is 0, appending `n` to `final` results in `final` containing a single element, which is `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of the original `mini` and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of times '0' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of times '1' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a sorted list containing the element `n`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, and the length of `final` is 1. Additionally, `c1` is less than 50.**
