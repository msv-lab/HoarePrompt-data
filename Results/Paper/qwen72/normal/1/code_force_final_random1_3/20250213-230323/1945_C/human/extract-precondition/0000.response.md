Precondition: **The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving a series of test cases, each containing a string `a` of length `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5), where `a` consists only of '0' and '1'. The function should determine the optimal position `i` to place a road such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side, and `i` should be as close to the middle of the village as possible. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, with the total number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4) and the sum of all `n` values not exceeding 3·10^5.**
