Postcondition: ***`one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 1, `zero` is 2 if `s[1]` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 1, `one` remains unchanged, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 2`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is a list containing `[1, 2]`. Otherwise, `lst` is a list containing `[2]`. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, and if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes `0` as its last element. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` includes `n` as its last element. If `len(final) != 0`, `final` remains unchanged.***
