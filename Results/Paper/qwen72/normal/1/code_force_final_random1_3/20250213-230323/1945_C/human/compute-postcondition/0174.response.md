The value of `zero` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `one_perc` is 0, `zero` is 3 (if `s[i]` is '0' initially), `zero_perc` is 100 (if `s[i]` is '0' initially), `one` is 0 (if `s[i]` is '0' initially). If the first character of `s` is not '0': `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 0. If `s[i]` is not '0' and `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one` is 1 or 2, and `lst` is [1, 2]. Otherwise, `lst` remains [1].**
