To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be greater than 1. Since `n` is already given as an input integer greater than 1, no adjustment is needed for `n`.

However, the variable `i` needs to be set correctly for the loop to start. In Python, the `range` function generates numbers starting from 0 up to but not including the specified stop value. Therefore, `i` should start at 0.

Given these considerations, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` should be 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1 (which is already given).

All other variables mentioned in the state before the loop starts do not affect the loop's ability to execute and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1**
