To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and the initial conditions step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an input integer greater than 2
- `one_perc` is 0
- If `s[i]` is '0':
  - `zero` is 3
  - `zero_perc` is 100
  - `one` is 0
- If the first character of `s` is not '0':
  - `one` is 1
  - `zero_perc` is 0
- If `s[i]` is not '0' and `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50:
  - `zero` is 1
  - `zero_perc` is 50
  - `one` is 1 or 2
  - `lst` is [1, 2]
- Otherwise, `lst` remains [1]
- If `s[i]` is not '0':
  - `one` is 2
  - `zero` is 1
  - `zero_perc` is 50
  - `lst` is [1, 2] if `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains [1]

### Code:
```python
zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `zero` and `i`:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - The value of `zero` depends on the conditions:
     - If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is 3.
     - If `s[i]` is not '0', `zero` is 1 (if `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50) or 1 (if `s[i]` is not '0' and `zero_perc` is 50).

2. **Calculate `zero_perc`:**
   - `zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)`
   - Since `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3.
   - If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is 3:
     - `zero_perc = 3 * 100 // 3 = 100`
   - If `s[i]` is not '0', `zero` is 1:
     - `zero_perc = 1 * 100 // 3 = 33`

### Output State:
- If `s[i]` is '0':
  - `i` is 2
  - `n` is an input integer greater than 2
  - `one_perc` is 0
  - `zero` is 3
  - `zero_perc` is 100
  - `one` is 0
  - `lst` is [1]
- If `s[i]` is not '0':
  - `i` is 2
  - `n` is an input integer greater than 2
  - `one_perc` is 0
  - `zero` is 1
  - `zero_perc` is 33
  - `one` is 2
  - `lst` is [1, 2] if `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains [1]

Output State: **If `s[i]` is '0': `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `one_perc` is 0, `zero` is 3, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is 0, `lst` is [1]. If `s[i]` is not '0': `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `one_perc` is 0, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 33, `one` is 2, `lst` is [1, 2] if `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains [1].**
