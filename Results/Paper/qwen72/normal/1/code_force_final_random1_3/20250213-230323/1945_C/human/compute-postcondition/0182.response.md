To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object in the loop head, which is `lst`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`
- `one` is the number of '1's in `s`
- `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the processed part of `s`
- `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the remaining part of `s`
- `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%
- The values of `n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `mini`, and `final` remain unchanged

For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `lst` is not empty.

State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the processed part of `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the remaining part of `s`, `lst` must contain at least one element, the values of `n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `mini`, and `final` remain unchanged**
