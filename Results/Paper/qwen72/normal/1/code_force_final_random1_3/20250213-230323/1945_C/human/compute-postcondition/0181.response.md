Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the processed part of `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the remaining part of `s`, and `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%. The values of `n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `mini`, and `final` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `i` will be `n - 2` because the loop runs from `0` to `n - 2` (inclusive).
- `zero` will be the total count of '0's in the string `s`.
- `one` will be the total count of '1's in the string `s`.
- `zero_perc` will be the percentage of '0's in the processed part of the string `s` (from index `0` to `i`).
- `one_perc` will be the percentage of '1's in the remaining part of the string `s` (from index `i + 1` to `n - 1`).
- `lst` will contain all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%.
- The other variables (`n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `mini`, and `final`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
