The code appends the value of `missing` to the list `results`. The value of `missing` is calculated as the sum of the differences between `m` and each frequency in `freq` where the frequency is less than `m`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the values of `missing` (one more value added), `n` is the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `a` is a non-empty list, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of the character 'A' + i in `a`, `missing` is the sum of the differences between `m` and each frequency in `freq` where the frequency is less than `m`.**
