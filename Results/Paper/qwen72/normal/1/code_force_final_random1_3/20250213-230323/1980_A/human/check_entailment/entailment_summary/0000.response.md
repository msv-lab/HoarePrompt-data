Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case, which includes the number of problems (`n`), the number of rounds (`m`), and the string of problem difficulties (`a`).

2. **Frequency Calculation**: For each test case, the program initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (one for each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'). It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `freq` array based on the character's position in the alphabet.

3. **Missing Problems Calculation**: The program calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by using the formula `max(0, m - f)` for each frequency `f` in the `freq` array. This ensures that if the current frequency of a difficulty level is less than `m`, the difference is added to the total count of missing problems.

4. **Result Collection**: The calculated number of missing problems for each test case is appended to the `results` list.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the results for each test case.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, and the execution summary confirms that it behaves as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
