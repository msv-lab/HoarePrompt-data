The only object in the loop head is the variable `prob` and the string `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `a`. If there are more characters left in `a`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `prob` was the first character in the string `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least two characters, and `prob` will be the second character in the string `a`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `missing`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string consisting of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G' and must have at least two characters, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is 1 and the rest are 0, `missing` is the sum of the differences between `m` and each frequency in `freq` where the frequency is less than `m`, `prob` is the second character in the string `a`.**
