The only object in the loop head is the variable `prob`, which is an element from the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `a` to assign to `prob`.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty list, and `prob` was set to the current element being processed. For the loop to execute again, `prob` must be set to the next element in `a`.

Since `a` is a non-empty list, if there are more elements left in `a`, the loop will continue to the next element. Therefore, the state of `prob` changes to the next element in `a`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the values of `missing` (one more value added), `n` is the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `a` is a non-empty list, `freq` is a list of 7 zeros except the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` which is now 1, `missing` is the sum of the differences between `m` and each frequency in `freq` where the frequency is less than `m`, `prob` is the next element in `a`**
