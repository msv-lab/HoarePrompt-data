Output State: **The program returns a list `results` containing `t` values of `missing`, where each `missing` value corresponds to the result of processing one tuple from `test_cases`. Each `missing` value represents the sum of the differences between `m` and the frequency of each character from 'A' to 'G' in the string `a`, where the frequency is less than `m`.**
