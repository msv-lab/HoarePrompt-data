The code snippet `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1` increments the value at the index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` in the list `freq`. This means that the frequency count for the character `prob` (assuming `prob` is a capital letter from 'A' to 'G') is incremented by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 0 < t <= 1000
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples
- `results` is a list containing the values of `missing` (one more value added)
- `n` is the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`
- `m` is the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`
- `a` is a non-empty list
- `freq` is a list of 7 zeros
- `missing` is the sum of the differences between `m` and each frequency in `freq` where the frequency is less than `m`

After executing the code snippet:
- The value at the index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` in `freq` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the values of `missing` (one more value added), `n` is the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `a` is a non-empty list, `freq` is a list of 7 zeros except the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` which is now 1, `missing` is the sum of the differences between `m` and each frequency in `freq` where the frequency is less than `m`.**
