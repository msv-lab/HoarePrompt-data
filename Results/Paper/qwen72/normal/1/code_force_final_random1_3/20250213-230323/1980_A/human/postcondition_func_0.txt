The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases` as inputs. Each tuple in `test_cases` consists of a tuple `(n, m)` and a string `a`, where `n` is the number of problems, `m` is the number of rounds, and `a` is a string of problem difficulties. The function calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case to ensure that each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') appears at least `m` times. It returns a list `results` containing `t` integers, each representing the number of additional problems required for the corresponding test case.
