You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

The loop has completed all its iterations for all test cases. For each query `(x, y)`, if `y` > `x`, the program prints the result of `d1[y] - d1[x]`. If `y` ≤ `x`, the program prints the result of `d2[y] - d2[x]`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given `n` cities on a number line with unique positions.
   - Each city has a unique closest city.
   - We need to answer `m` queries about the minimum cost to travel from one city to another using either direct travel (costing the absolute difference in positions) or traveling to the closest city (costing 1 coin).

2. **Algorithm Overview:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming to precompute the minimum cost to travel from each city to its closest city in both directions (left and right).
   - It then uses these precomputed values to answer the queries efficiently.

3. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **Input Reading:**
     - The program reads the number of test cases, the number of cities, their positions, and the queries.
   - **Precomputation:**
     - `d1` is a dictionary that stores the minimum cost to travel from city `i` to the rightmost city.
     - `d2` is a dictionary that stores the minimum cost to travel from city `i` to the leftmost city.
     - The program initializes `d1[2]` and `d2[n-1]` to 1 because the cost to travel to the closest city is 1 coin.
     - For each city `i` (from 1 to `n-1`), it updates `d1` based on whether the next city is closer than the previous city.
     - Similarly, for each city `i` (from `n-2` to 1), it updates `d2` based on whether the previous city is closer than the next city.
   - **Query Handling:**
     - For each query `(x, y)`, it checks if `y` is greater than `x` and prints the difference in costs from `d1` or `d2` accordingly.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program assumes that the closest city is always unique, which is given in the problem statement.
   - The program does not handle the case where `x` and `y` are the same city, but the problem statement guarantees that `x_i ≠ y_i`.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The logic for precomputing the minimum costs in both directions is correct.
   - The query handling correctly uses the precomputed values to find the minimum cost.
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and should work as expected for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
