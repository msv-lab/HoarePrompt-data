Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 where `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is an input integer greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input. If `y` > `x`, the program does not modify any of these variables. If `y` ≤ `x`, the program also does not modify any of these variables.***
