To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers from user input.
   - `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0.
   - `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is set to 1.
   - `m` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input, and `y` is greater than `x`.

2. **Relevant Variables:**
   - `d1` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0. This means that any key that is not explicitly set in `d1` will return 0 when accessed.
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input, and `y` is greater than `x`.

3. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` will print the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.
   - Since `d1` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0, if `y` and `x` are not keys in `d1`, both `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` will be 0.
   - Therefore, `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `0 - 0 = 0`.

Given the initial state and the nature of the defaultdict `d1`, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **0**
