Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of: n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities; a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, representing the coordinates of the cities; m is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries; and queries is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the queries. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    d1 = defaultdict(int)
    d2 = defaultdict(int)
    d1[2] = 1
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
            d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
        else:
            d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]
    d2[n - 1] = 1
    for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
        if l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]:
            d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]
        else:
            d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]
    m = int(input())
    for j in range(m):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        if y > x:
            print(d1[y] - d1[x])
        else:
            print(d2[y] - d2[x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 where `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `j` is `m-1`, and `x` and `y` are integers provided by the last user input. If `y` > `x`, the program prints the result of `d1[y] - d1[x]`. If `y` ≤ `x`, the program prints the result of `d2[y] - d2[x]`. The loop has completed all its iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers from the latest user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is the new input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the integers provided by the last user input. The loop has executed `m` times, and the values of `d1` and `d2` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `y` are the inputs from the last iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than or equal to 3), `l` is a new list of integers from the latest user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d1[2]` is 1, `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is the new input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the integers provided by the last user input. If `y` > `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`. If `y` ≤ `x`, then `y` is less than or equal to `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
