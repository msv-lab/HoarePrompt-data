Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers from the latest user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `m` is an input integer, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the last user input. If the difference between the second and first elements of `l` is less than the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`, then `d1[3]` is 2. Otherwise, `d1[3]` is `l[2] - l[1] + d1[2]`.***
