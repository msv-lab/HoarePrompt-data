Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers from the latest user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `m` is an input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the last user input. If the difference between the third and second elements of `l` is less than the difference between the second and first elements of `l`, then `d1[3]` is 2 and `d1[4]` is 4. Otherwise, `d1[3]` is `l[2] - l[1] + d1[2]` and `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2] + 1`.**
