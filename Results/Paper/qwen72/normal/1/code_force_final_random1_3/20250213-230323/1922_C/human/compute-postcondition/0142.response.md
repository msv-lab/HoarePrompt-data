Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` must be greater than 3, `l` is a new list of integers from the latest user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d1[2]` is 1, `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`, `m` is the new input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, and `x` and `y` are the integers provided by the last user input.**

Explanation:
- The code `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]` updates the value of `d2[i]` to be `1 + d2[i + 1]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- The value of `d2[i]` is now `1 + d2[i + 1]`, which means it depends on the value of `d2[i + 1]`.
- The initial state information for all other variables remains valid.
