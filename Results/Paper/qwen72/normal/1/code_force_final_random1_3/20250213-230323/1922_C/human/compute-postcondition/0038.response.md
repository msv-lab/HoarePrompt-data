Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 where `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The variable `m` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `m` now holds an integer value provided by the user.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial conditions for `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, and `d2` are still valid and are included in the output state.
