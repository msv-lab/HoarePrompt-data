The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 0
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0

After executing the code snippet:
- The variable `l` is now a list of integers, where each integer is derived from the input provided by the user.

The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers from user input.**
