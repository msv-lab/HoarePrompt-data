Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d1[2]` is 1, `d1[3]` is 2, `d1[4]` is 3, `d1[5]` is `l[4] - l[3] + 3`, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0. If the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is less than the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`, then the difference between the second and first elements of `l` is less than the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`. Otherwise, `d1[3]` is `l[2] - l[1] + 1`, `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`, and the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`.**
