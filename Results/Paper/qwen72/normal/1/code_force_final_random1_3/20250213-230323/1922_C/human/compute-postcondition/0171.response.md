Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a list of city coordinates and a set of queries. It calculates two sets of distances (`d1` and `d2`) based on the city coordinates. For each query, it returns the difference in these distances between the specified cities. Specifically, for each query `(x, y)`, if `y` > `x`, it prints `d1[y] - d1[x]`; otherwise, it prints `d2[y] - d2[x]`. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final state includes the processed test cases and printed results for each query. **
