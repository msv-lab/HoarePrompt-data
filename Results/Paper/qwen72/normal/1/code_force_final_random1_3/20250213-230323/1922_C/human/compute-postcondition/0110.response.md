Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `l` is a list of integers from the latest user input.
- `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, and `d1[2]` is 1.
- `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is 1.
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `j` is 2.
- `x` and `y` are the new integers provided by the latest user input.
- If `y` > `x`, the state remains unchanged.
- If `y` ≤ `x`, the state also remains unchanged.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(d2[y] - d2[x])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Defaultdict Initialization**:
   - `d2` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0.
   - `d2[n - 1]` is explicitly set to 1.

2. **Values of `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` and `y` are provided by the latest user input.
   - The conditions `y > x` and `y ≤ x` do not change the state, so we can assume `x` and `y` are valid integers.

3. **Lookup in `d2`**:
   - `d2[y]` will return the value associated with `y` in `d2`. If `y` is not a key in `d2`, it will return the default value of 0.
   - `d2[x]` will return the value associated with `x` in `d2`. If `x` is not a key in `d2`, it will return the default value of 0.

4. **Possible Values**:
   - If `y == n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 1.
   - If `x == n - 1`, then `d2[x]` will be 1.
   - For any other values of `y` and `x`, `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` will be 0.

### Conclusion:
- If `y == n - 1` and `x != n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `1 - 0 = 1`.
- If `x == n - 1` and `y != n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `0 - 1 = -1`.
- If neither `y` nor `x` is equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `0 - 0 = 0`.

### Final Output:
Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] is 1 if y == n - 1, otherwise 0, and d2[x] is 1 if x == n - 1, otherwise 0)**
