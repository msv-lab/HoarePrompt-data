Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers from the latest user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `m` is an input integer, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the last user input.**

Explanation: The code reinitializes `d2` as a new defaultdict with a default value of 0, which overwrites the previous initialization where `d2[n - 1]` was set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
