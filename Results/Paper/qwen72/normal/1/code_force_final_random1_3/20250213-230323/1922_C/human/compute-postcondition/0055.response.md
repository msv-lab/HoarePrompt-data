Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 where `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is an input integer greater than 2, `j` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the latest user input. If `y` > `x`, the program follows the postcondition of the if part. Otherwise, the program follows the postcondition of the else part.*** 

Note: Since the if and else parts do not specify any changes to the variables, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
