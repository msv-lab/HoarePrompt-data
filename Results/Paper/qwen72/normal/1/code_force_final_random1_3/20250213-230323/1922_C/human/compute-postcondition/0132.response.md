Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 3), `l` is a new list of integers from the latest user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d1[2]` is 1, `d1[3]` is either 1 or `l[2] - l[1] + 1`, `d1[4]` is either 2, `l[2] - l[1] + 2`, or `l[3] - l[2] + 1` or `l[3] - l[1] + 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 (and no longer contains the entry `d2[n - 1]`), `m` is the new input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, and `x` and `y` are the integers provided by the last user input. If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[4]` is either 2 or `l[2] - l[1] + 2` and `d1[5]` is 1 + `d1[4]`. Otherwise, `d1[4]` is either `l[3] - l[2] + 1` or `l[3] - l[1] + 1` and `d1[5]` is `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`.***
