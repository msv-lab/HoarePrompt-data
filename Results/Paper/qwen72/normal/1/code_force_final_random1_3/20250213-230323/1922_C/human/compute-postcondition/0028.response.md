The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. The loop iterates backward from `n - 2` down to `1` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `n - 3`. For the loop condition to still hold (`i > 0`), `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 where `d2[n - 1]` is 1. If the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is less than the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`, then `d2[n - 2]` is 2. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + 1`.**
