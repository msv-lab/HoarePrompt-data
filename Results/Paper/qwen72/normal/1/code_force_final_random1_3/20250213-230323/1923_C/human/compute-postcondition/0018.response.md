The code snippet `c.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `c`. The initial state specifies that `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j]`. After appending `j` to `c`, the list `c` will contain three elements: `[0, j, j]`.

The values of `t`, `int(input())`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is also unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing the elements [0, `i`, `i`], `c` is a list containing the elements [0, `j`, `j`]. If `x` == 1, then `i` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `i` remains unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1 if `x` == 1 (if `j` was 0, it becomes 1; if `j` was 1, it becomes 2); otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.**
