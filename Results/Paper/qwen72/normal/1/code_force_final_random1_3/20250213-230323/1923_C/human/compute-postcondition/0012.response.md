The code snippet `c.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Given the initial state, `c` initially contains a single element `[0]`. The value of `j` depends on the value of `x`: if `x` is 1, then `j` is 1; otherwise, `j` remains 0.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- If `x` is 1, `c` becomes `[0, 1]`.
- If `x` is not 1, `c` becomes `[0, 0]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing the elements [0, `i`], `c` is a list containing the elements [0, `j`], `i` is `x`, and if `x` is 1, then `j` is 1. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
