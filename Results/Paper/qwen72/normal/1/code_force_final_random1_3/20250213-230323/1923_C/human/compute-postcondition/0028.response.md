The value of `i` is assigned the result of `c[b] - c[a - 1]`. The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are input integers, and `m` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` remains unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are used to index into the list `c`, and the difference between the elements at these indices is stored in `i`.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`**.
