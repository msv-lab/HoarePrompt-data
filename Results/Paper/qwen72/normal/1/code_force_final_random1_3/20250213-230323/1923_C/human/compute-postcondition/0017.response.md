The code snippet `p.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. Here’s the step-by-step impact:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` and `m` are integers read from input.
   - `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements.
   - `p` is a list containing the elements [0, `i`].
   - `c` is a list containing the elements [0, `j`].
   - If `x` == 1, then `i` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.
   - `j` is incremented by 1 if `x` == 1 (if `j` was 0, it becomes 1; if `j` was 1, it becomes 2); otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The value of `i` is appended to the list `p`.
   - The list `p` now contains the elements [0, `i`, `i`].

3. **Updated State**:
   - `p` is now a list containing the elements [0, `i`, `i`].
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing the elements [0, `i`, `i`], `c` is a list containing the elements [0, `j`]. If `x` == 1, then `i` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `i` remains unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1 if `x` == 1 (if `j` was 0, it becomes 1; if `j` was 1, it becomes 2); otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.**
