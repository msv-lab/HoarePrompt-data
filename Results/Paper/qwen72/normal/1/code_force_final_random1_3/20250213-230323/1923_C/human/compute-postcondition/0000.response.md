To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object in the loop head, which is the variable `_`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This value represents the number of test cases, denoted as `t` in the state description.

Given the state before the loop starts, we know that `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `int(input())` should be at least 1, which aligns with the given constraint for `t`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `int(input())` is at least 1, and the loop variable `_` is initialized to 0 (as it is typically the case for loop counters).

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
