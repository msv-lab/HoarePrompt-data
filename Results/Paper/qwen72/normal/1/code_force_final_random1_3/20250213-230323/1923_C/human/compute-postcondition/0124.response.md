The code `c.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Based on the initial state, the value of `j` is either 3 (if `x` is 1) or 1 (if `x` is not 1). Therefore, the updated list `c` will be:

- If `x` is 1, `c` was initially `[0, 2, 2]`, and after appending `j` (which is 3), `c` becomes `[0, 2, 2, 3]`.
- If `x` is not 1, `c` was initially `[0, 0, 0]`, and after appending `j` (which is 1), `c` becomes `[0, 0, 0, 1]`.

The rest of the variables (`_`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `i`, `x`, `a`, `b`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers read from user input that must have at least 3 elements, `p` is `[0, x, 2 * x, 3 * x]`, `i` is `3 * x`, `x` is the third element of `l`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `x` is 1, then `c` is `[0, 2, 2, 3]` and `j` is 3. Otherwise, if `x` is not 1, then `c` is `[0, 0, 0, 1]` and `j` is 1.**
