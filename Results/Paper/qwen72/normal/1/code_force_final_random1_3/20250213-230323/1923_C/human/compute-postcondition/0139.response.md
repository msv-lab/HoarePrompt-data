Based on the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down the situation step by step:

1. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `_` is incremented by 1. This doesn't affect the `print` statement directly.
   - `n` and `m` are integers read from user input.
   - `l` is a list of integers read from user input.
   - `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
   - `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative counts of 1s in `l`.
   - `i` is now `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, which represents the count of 1s in the sublist `l[a-1:b]`.
   - `j` is the count of 1s in the entire list `l`.
   - `a` and `b` are integers read from user input.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `s` is the difference between `p[b]` and `p[a-1]`, which represents the sum of the elements in the sublist `l[a-1:b]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Given the initial state and the provided code, the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned. It only prints a fixed string.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **YES**
