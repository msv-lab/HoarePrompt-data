The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own set of parameters. The function accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer representing the length of the list `c`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
  - `q`: An integer representing the number of queries, where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5.
  - `c`: A list of `n` integers, where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
  - `l_i` and `r_i`: Integers for each query, where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.

The function processes each test case and each query within the test case to produce a result. However, the specific output for each query is not detailed in the provided information. Based on common patterns in such functions, it is likely that the function returns a list of results corresponding to each query for each test case.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept multiple test cases, each defined by `n`, `q`, `c`, and a series of queries `(l_i, r_i)`, and return the results of processing these queries.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of elements `n`, the number of queries `q`, a list of integers `c`, and a series of query ranges `(l_i, r_i)`. It returns the results of processing these queries for each test case.**
