Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `m` remain as input integers with `m` being greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` remain as input integers, `i` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative sums of elements in `l`, `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative counts of 1s in `l`, `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
    s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `m` remain as input integers with `m` being greater than 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is the difference between the cumulative count of 1s up to index `b` and the cumulative count of 1s up to index `a - 1` in the list `c`, `s` is now `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative sums of elements in `l`, `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative counts of 1s in `l`, `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`. If the length of the subarray from index `a` to `b` (inclusive) is greater than 1 and the difference between the sum of elements in the subarray from index `a` to `b` and the length of this subarray is greater than or equal to the difference in the cumulative count of 1s between these indices, then the condition holds true. Otherwise, either the length of the subarray from index `a` to `b` is 1 or less, or the difference between the sum of elements in the subarray from index `a` to `b` and the length of this subarray is less than the difference in the cumulative count of 1s between these indices.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `m` remain as input integers with `m` being greater than 0, `a` and `b` are new input integers, `i` is now `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is now `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative sums of elements in `l`, `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative counts of 1s in `l`, `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`. The loop will execute `m-1` more times. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the program follows the conditions specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program follows the conditions specified in the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `m` remain as input integers with `m` being greater than 0, `a` and `b` are new input integers, `i` is now `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is now `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative sums of elements in `l`, `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative counts of 1s in `l`, `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the loop will execute `m-2` more times. Otherwise, the loop will also execute `m-2` more times.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
