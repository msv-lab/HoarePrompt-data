Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if a subarray of the given array `c` is "good" based on the criteria specified in the problem statement. A subarray is considered good if there exists another array `b` of the same length such that the sum of elements in both arrays is equal, no element in `b` is the same as the corresponding element in the subarray of `c`, and all elements in `b` are positive.

### Key Points in the Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `p` is initialized as a list with a single element `0` to store the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
   - `c` is initialized similarly to store the cumulative count of `1`s in `l`.

2. **Cumulative Sums and Counts**:
   - The program iterates through the list `l` and updates `p` with the cumulative sum of elements.
   - It also updates `c` with the cumulative count of `1`s encountered so far.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `c[a:b]` using the cumulative sums stored in `p`.
   - It also calculates the count of `1`s in the subarray using the cumulative counts stored in `c`.
   - The program checks if the subarray is good by verifying two conditions:
     - The length of the subarray is greater than 1 (`b - a + 1 > 1`).
     - The sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of `1`s in the subarray (`s - (b - a + 1) >= i`).

### Analysis:
- **Condition 1**: `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has at least two elements, which is necessary to construct a different array `b` where no element is the same as the corresponding element in `c`.
- **Condition 2**: `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that there is enough "slack" in the sum to allow for the construction of `b` such that all elements are positive and different from the corresponding elements in `c`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given criteria. The conditions used in the program are logically sound and align with the problem requirements.
