Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is the first element of `l`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `l` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i]`, `c` is `[0]`, `x` is the first element of `l`. If `x` is 1, then `j` is 1. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` (which is the first element of `l`) is appended to the list `p`.
- Initially, `p` was `[0]`, so after appending `i`, `p` becomes `[0, i]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `l`, `c`, `x`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
