Output State: **`n` and `m` remain as input integers with `m` being greater than 0, `a` and `b` are new input integers, `i` is now `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is now `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative sums of elements in `l`, `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative counts of 1s in `l`, `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`. The loop will execute `m-2` more times.**

Explanation:
- The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The values of `i` and `s` are calculated based on the new values of `a` and `b` using the existing lists `c` and `p`.
- The loop will still execute `m-2` more times, as the initial state indicated.
