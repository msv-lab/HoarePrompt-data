You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; l_i and r_i are integers for each query where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [0]
        
        c = [0]
        
        i, j = 0, 0
        
        for x in l:
            if x == 1:
                j += 1
            i += x
            p.append(i)
            c.append(j)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
            s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `_` has been decremented to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The lists `p` and `c` have been updated to contain the cumulative sums and counts of 1s, respectively, for each list `l` of integers provided in the input. The variables `n` and `m` retain their values as the number of elements in `l` and the number of queries, respectively, for each test case. The variables `i` and `s` are updated for each query based on the cumulative sums and counts stored in `p` and `c`. For each query, if the conditions `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` are met, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The final state of the loop is such that all test cases and their respective queries have been processed, and the appropriate outputs have been generated for each query.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of elements `n`, the number of queries `q`, a list of integers `c`, and a series of query ranges `(l_i, r_i)`. It returns the results of processing these queries for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
