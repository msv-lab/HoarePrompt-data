### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input for multiple test cases, the number of elements `n`, the number of queries `m`, and the list of integers `l`.

2. **Cumulative Sums and Counts**:
   - The program initializes two lists, `p` and `c`, to store cumulative sums and counts of 1s, respectively.
   - For each element `x` in the list `l`, it updates the cumulative sum `i` and the count of 1s `j`.
   - These values are appended to `p` and `c` respectively.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `a` and `b`.
   - It calculates the sum of the subarray `s` using the cumulative sums stored in `p`.
   - It also calculates the count of 1s in the subarray `i` using the cumulative counts stored in `c`.
   - The program checks if the subarray is "good" by verifying the conditions:
     - `b - a + 1 > 1`: This ensures the subarray has more than one element.
     - `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`: This ensures that the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is at least the count of 1s in the subarray.

4. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as specified, and the conditions for determining if a subarray is "good" are correctly checked.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
