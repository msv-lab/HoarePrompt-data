To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 1.
- `m` is greater than 1.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

### Condition:
- The condition checks if the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than 1 and if the value of `s` minus the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than or equal to `i`.
- If the condition is met, the code prints 'YES'.
- If the condition is not met, the code does not print anything (or it could be assumed that it prints nothing).

### Analysis:
1. **Difference Calculation**:
   - The difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is `(b - a + 1)`.
   - This value must be greater than 1 for the first part of the condition to be true.

2. **Value of `s`**:
   - `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition is: `(b - a + 1) > 1` and `(s - (b - a + 1)) >= i`.
   - If both parts of this condition are true, the code prints 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the condition, the code will print 'YES' if the condition is met. Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `p` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `i` and `s`. However, based on the structure of the problem, if the condition is met, the print statement will output 'YES'.

Output: **YES (if the condition is met)**

If the condition is not met, the output would be nothing, but since the question asks for what will be printed, and the only print statement is 'YES', the output is:

Output: **YES**
