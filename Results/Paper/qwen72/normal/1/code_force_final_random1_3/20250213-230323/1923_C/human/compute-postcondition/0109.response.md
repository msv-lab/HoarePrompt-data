Postcondition: ***`_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers read from user input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0]`, `c` is `[0]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x` is the first element of `l`, all other variables (`a`, `b`, `s`) remain unchanged. If `x` is equal to 1, `j` is set to 1.***
