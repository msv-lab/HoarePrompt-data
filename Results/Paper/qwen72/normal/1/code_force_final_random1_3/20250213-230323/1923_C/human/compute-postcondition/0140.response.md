Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is incremented by 1 (though this doesn't affect the print statement).
- `n` and `m` are integers read from user input.
- `l` is a list of integers read from user input.
- `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative counts of 1s in `l`.
- `i` is now `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `j` is the count of 1s in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from user input.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `s` is the difference between `p[b]` and `p[a-1]`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables and objects described in the initial state.

Output: **NO**
