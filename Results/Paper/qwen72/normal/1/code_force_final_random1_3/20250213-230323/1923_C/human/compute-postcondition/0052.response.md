The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are input integers, with `m` being greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

After executing the code snippet, the variable `l` is assigned a list of integers from the input.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `l` is a list of integers from the input.**
