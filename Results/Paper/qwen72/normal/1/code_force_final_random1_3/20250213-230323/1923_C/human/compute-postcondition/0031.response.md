To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `_` is 0.
2. `m` is greater than 0.
3. `a` and `b` are input integers.
4. `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
5. `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
6. The difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than 1, which means \( b - a + 1 > 1 \).
7. The value of `s` minus the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than or equal to `i`, which means \( s - (b - a + 1) \geq i \).

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will always print the string `'YES'` because the conditions provided do not affect the content of the `print` statement itself. The conditions only ensure that the code reaches this point without any errors or contradictions.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
