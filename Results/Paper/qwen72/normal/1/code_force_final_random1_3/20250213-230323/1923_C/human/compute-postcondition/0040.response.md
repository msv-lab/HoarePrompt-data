To determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 1.
- `m` is greater than 1.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

### Condition:
- The condition is checked as follows:
  - If the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than 1 (i.e., `b - a + 1 > 1`).
  - And the value of `s` minus the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than or equal to `i` (i.e., `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`).

### Analysis:
- The `print('NO')` statement is executed regardless of the condition being true or false. This means that the output will always be 'NO', because the `print` statement is not inside any conditional block.

### Conclusion:
The `print('NO')` statement will always print 'NO' based on the given code snippet.

Output: **NO**
