Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are input integers, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is the first element of `l`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `l` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is `[0, i]`, `c` is `[0, j]`, `x` is the second element of `l`. If `x` is 1, then `j` is 2. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.***
