The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing the elements [0, `i`], `c` is a list containing the elements [0, `j` + 1], `i` is the next element in `l`, and if the next element in `l` is 1, then `j` was 1 before the increment and is now 2. Otherwise, `j` was 0 before the increment and is now 1.**
