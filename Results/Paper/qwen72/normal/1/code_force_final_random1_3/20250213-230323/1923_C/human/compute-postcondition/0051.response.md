The values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the input provided by the user. The input is split and converted to integers using the `map` function. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**
