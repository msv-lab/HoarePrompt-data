Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a new list of integers converted from the new input string such that `a[0] == b[0]`, `new[0]` is `a[0]` (or `b[0]`), `new[1]` is `a[1]` (or `b[1]`), `new[2]` is the maximum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`, `new2[0]` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `new2[1]` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `b[1]`, `new2[2]` is the minimum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`, `i` is 2, `len(a) > 1`, `a[1] == b[1]`.**
