To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - `i`: This is the index used to iterate through the lists `a` and `b`.
   - `len(a)`: The length of the list `a`.
   - `a[i]`: The element at index `i` in list `a`.
   - `b[i]`: The element at index `i` in list `b`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `b` is a new list of integers.
   - `len(a)` is the length of list `a`.

3. **Loop Condition Breakdown:**
   - `i < len(a)`: This ensures that the index `i` is within the bounds of the list `a`.
   - `a[i] == b[i]`: This checks if the elements at index `i` in both lists `a` and `b` are equal.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes:**
   - For the loop to execute, both conditions must be true:
     - `i < len(a)`: Since `i` is 0, this condition will always be true as long as `len(a)` is greater than 0.
     - `a[i] == b[i]`: This condition depends on the values of `a[0]` and `b[0]`.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - `i` is already 0, so no adjustment is needed.
   - `len(a)` must be greater than 0 for the loop to start. This is already implied by the initial state where `a` is a list of integers.
   - `a[0]` and `b[0]` must be equal for the loop to execute the first time.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes the first time, we need to ensure that `a[0]` and `b[0]` are equal. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, we need to adjust the state to reflect this requirement.

### Final State:
State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a new list of integers converted from the new input string, `i` is 0, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, and `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`**.
