Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where \(1 \leq x, y < 10^{100}\), and each digit in `x` and `y` is from 1 to 9.
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers.
- `new` is a list that contains the maximum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`.
- `new2` is a list that contains the minimum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`.
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, then:
  - `new` will have the minimum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` from the first index where `a[i] != b[i]` to the end of the list.
  - `new2` will have the maximum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` from the first index where `a[i] != b[i]` to the end of the list.
- `i` is the first index where `a[i] != b[i]` or the length of `a` if all elements are equal.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Values of `new` and `new2`:**
   - For indices where `a[i] == b[i]`, `new` will contain the maximum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` (which is the same as `a[i]` or `b[i]` since they are equal), and `new2` will contain the minimum value (also the same as `a[i]` or `b[i]`).
   - For indices where `a[i] != b[i]`, starting from the first such index `i`:
     - `new` will contain the minimum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
     - `new2` will contain the maximum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

2. **Construct the Output:**
   - The `print` statement joins the elements of `new2` into a single string and prints it.
   - Since `new2` contains the maximum values for indices where `a[i] != b[i]` and the minimum values for indices where `a[i] == b[i]`, the output will be a string representation of these values concatenated together.

### Final Output:
The output will be a string formed by concatenating the elements of `new2`, which contains the maximum values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for indices where `a[i] != b[i]` and the minimum values for indices where `a[i] == b[i]`.

Output: **''.join(str(x) for x in new2) (where new2 is a list containing the maximum values of a[i] and b[i] for indices where a[i] != b[i] and the minimum values for indices where a[i] == b[i])**
