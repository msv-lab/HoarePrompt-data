You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, x and y are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        b = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        new = [None] * len(a)
        
        new2 = [None] * len(a)
        
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
        
        if i != len(a):
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
            while i < len(a):
                new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
                new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
                i += 1
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9. For each iteration, `a` and `b` are lists of integers converted from the input strings `x` and `y`, respectively. The lists `new` and `new2` are generated for each pair of `a` and `b` such that: 
    #- `new` contains the maximum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`, and the minimum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` from the first index where `a[i] != b[i]` to the end of the list.
    #- `new2` contains the minimum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`, and the maximum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` from the first index where `a[i] != b[i]` to the end of the list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `x` and `y` are strings representing large integers (each digit from 1 to 9) within the range 1 to 10^100. The function returns the result of an operation involving these parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
