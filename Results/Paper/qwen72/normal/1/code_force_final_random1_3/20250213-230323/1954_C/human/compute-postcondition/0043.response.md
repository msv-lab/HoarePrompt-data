Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a new list of integers converted from the new input string, `new` is a list of `None` with the same length as `a`, `new2` is a list of `None` with the same length as `a`, `i` will be equal to the first index where `a[i] != b[i]` or the length of `a` if all elements are equal.**
