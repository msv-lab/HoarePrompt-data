Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple pairs of large integer strings (`x` and `y`) based on an integer `t` indicating the number of pairs. For each pair, it generates two new strings: one where the digits are the maximum of the corresponding digits in `x` and `y` up to the first differing digit, and the minimum thereafter; and another where the digits are the minimum of the corresponding digits in `x` and `y` up to the first differing digit, and the maximum thereafter. These two strings are printed for each pair. The function does not return any values but modifies and prints the results directly. After the function completes, `t` remains unchanged, and `x` and `y` retain their original values. **
