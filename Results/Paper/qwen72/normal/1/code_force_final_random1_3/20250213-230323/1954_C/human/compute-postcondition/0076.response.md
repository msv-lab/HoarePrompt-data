To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9.
- `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string `x`.
- `b` is a new list of integers converted from the input string `y` such that `a[i] == b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to the point where the loop stops.
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, `new` is a list where `new[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to the length of `a` - 1.
- `new2` is a list where `new2[i]` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to the length of `a` - 1.
- If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new` and `new2` retain their previous definitions up to the point where the loop stopped.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Conversion of Strings to Lists of Integers:**
   - `a` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the string `x`.
   - `b` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the string `y`.

2. **Comparison and Construction of `new` and `new2`:**
   - For each index `i` from 0 to the length of `a` - 1, `new[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
   - Similarly, `new2[i]` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement joins the elements of the `new` list into a single string and prints it.

### Example:
Let's consider an example to illustrate this:
- Suppose `x = "12345"` and `y = "67890"`.
- Then `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `b = [6, 7, 8, 9, 0]`.
- The `new` list will be `[min(1, 6), min(2, 7), min(3, 8), min(4, 9), min(5, 0)]`, which is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 0]`.
- The `print` statement will join these elements into a string: `'12340'`.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the logic described, the `print` statement will output the string representation of the `new` list, which contains the minimum values of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`.

Output: **''.join(str(x) for x in new) (where new is a list where new[i] is the minimum of a[i] and b[i] for all i from 0 to the length of a - 1)**

In simpler terms:
Output: **The string formed by joining the minimum values of corresponding elements from the lists `a` and `b`**.
