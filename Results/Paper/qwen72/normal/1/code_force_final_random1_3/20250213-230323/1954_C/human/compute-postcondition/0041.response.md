The code `b = list(map(int, list(input())))` reads a new input string, converts each character of the input string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9
- The list `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string
- The lists `b`, `new`, and `new2` remain unchanged
- The variable `i` will be equal to the first index where `a[i] != b[i]` or the length of `a` if all elements are equal

After executing the code:
- `b` is updated to a new list of integers converted from the new input string
- The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `new`, `new2`, and `i`) remain unchanged

Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a new list of integers converted from the new input string, `new` and `new2` remain unchanged, `i` will be equal to the first index where `a[i] != b[i]` or the length of `a` if all elements are equal.**
