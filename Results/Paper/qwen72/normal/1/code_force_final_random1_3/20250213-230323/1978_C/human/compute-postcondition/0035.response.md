Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is `k - n + 3`, and `1 + i` is less than or equal to `k`. The list `l` has `x` inserted at the beginning. If `1 + i` is greater than `k`, `x` is inserted at the position `-k` (which is `n - 3 - k`) from the end of the list `l`, and `x` is no longer at the beginning of the list `l`. If `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned with `x` inserted at the beginning.***
