The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and `k` is a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value such that 0 <= k <= 10^12. The function returns a modified list `l` based on the following cases:

- **Case_1:** The program returns the value of `l`, which is not defined in the initial state.
- **Case_2:** The program returns the list `l` with `x` inserted at the position `-k` from the end, and `x` is no longer the last element of `l`.
- **Case_3:** The program returns the list `l` with `x` inserted at the beginning, and `x` is no longer the last element of the list.
- **Case_4:** The program returns the list `l` with `x` inserted at the position `-k` from the end, and `x` is no longer at the end of the list `l`. If `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned as modified.
- **Case_5:** The program returns the list `l` with `x` inserted at the beginning if `1 + i` is less than or equal to `k`. If `1 + i` is greater than `k`, `x` is inserted at the position `-k` from the end of the list `l`. If `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned as modified.
- **Case_6:** The program returns the list `l` with the element `x` at the position `-k` (which is `n - 3 - k`), and `x` is no longer the last element of the list `l`. The list `l` has been modified such that the element `x` is placed at the specified index, and the rest of the elements in the list remain unchanged except for the removal of `x` from its original position at the end of the list.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and `k` is a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value. The function returns a modified list `l` based on the specified conditions, inserting the element `x` at different positions depending on the value of `k` and the current state of the list.**
