The function `func_3` accepts a positive integer `c` and a list `l` of integers with a length of at least 2*c. It swaps the elements at indices `c - 1` and `-c` in the list `l`. After the function executes, the list `l` is returned with these two elements swapped. The element originally at index `c - 1` is now at index `-c`, and the element originally at index `-c` is now at index `c - 1`.
