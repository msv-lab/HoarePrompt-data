To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given Loop:
```python
for i in range(n, -1, -2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `k` is now `k - (n - 2) + 1`
- `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `k` is greater than or equal to `(n - 2) - 1`

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1` and decreases by 2 each iteration.

### Adjusting the State:
- **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. For the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 2. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `n - 4`.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.

### New State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `k` is now `k - (n - 2) + 1`
- `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`
- `i` is `n - 4`
- `k` is greater than or equal to `(n - 2) - 1`

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is now `k - (n - 2) + 1`, `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, `i` is `n - 4`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `(n - 2) - 1`**
