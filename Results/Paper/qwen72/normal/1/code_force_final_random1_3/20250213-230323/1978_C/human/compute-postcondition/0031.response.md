Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, and `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000. It modifies `k` by dividing it by 2 and initializes a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n`. The function iterates over a range starting from `n` down to 0, decrementing by 2 in each step. During each iteration, it increments a counter `c` and checks conditions involving `k` and the current iteration index `i`. Depending on these conditions, the function may return the list `l`, call `func_2` with specific arguments, or update `l` using `func_3`. The final state of the program is determined by the value of `k` and the number of iterations completed. If `k` becomes 0, the function returns the current state of `l`. If `k` becomes less than `i - 1`, the function returns the result of `func_2`. Otherwise, it continues to update `k` and `l` until the loop completes, at which point it returns the final state of `l` or the result of `func_2` or `func_3`. **
