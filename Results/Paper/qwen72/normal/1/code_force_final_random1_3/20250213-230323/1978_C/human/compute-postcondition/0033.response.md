The code `l.insert(-k, x)` inserts the value `x` into the list `l` at the position `-k`. Since `1 + i` is less than or equal to `k`, and `i` is `n - 3`, we know that `-k` is a valid index within the bounds of the list `l`.

The value of `k` is `k - n + 3`, which means that `-k` is equivalent to `n - 3 - k`. This index is used to insert `x` into the list `l`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is `k - n + 3`, `1 + i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` now contains `x` at the position `-k` (which is `n - 3 - k`), and `x` is no longer the last element of the list `l`.**
