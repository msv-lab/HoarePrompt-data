The values of `n` and `k` are updated by the function `func_4()`. Since the specific implementation of `func_4()` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact new values of `n` and `k`. However, we know that `n` and `k` will still satisfy the conditions 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12 after the function call.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated by `func_4()`, and 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= 10^12.**
