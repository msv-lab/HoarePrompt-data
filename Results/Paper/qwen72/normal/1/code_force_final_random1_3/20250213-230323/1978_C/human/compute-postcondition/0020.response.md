Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is now `k - (n - 2) + 1`, `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, `i` is `n - 2`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `(n - 2) - 1`. If `k` is 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(2, l)` where `l` is the initial value of `l`. If `k` is less than `i - 1`, the program returns the result of `func_2(2, k, l)` where `k` is `k // 2 - (n - 2) + 1`, and `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)` with `l` being the initial value of `l`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is updated to the result of `func_3(2, l)`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged from the initial state.
