The function `func_5(l)` is called with the argument `l`, which is the result of `func_1(n, k)`. Since the specific implementation of `func_5` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the state. However, we can infer that `func_5` may modify `l` or other variables, or it might return a value.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are updated by `func_4()`.
- 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
- 0 <= k <= 10^12
- `n` is not equal to 0
- `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`

After executing `func_5(l)`, the state could be one of the following:
1. `l` is modified by `func_5`.
2. A new variable is returned or modified by `func_5`.
3. No changes are made to the state.

Since we don't have the details of `func_5`, we will assume that `func_5` does not modify any global variables and only affects the local variable `l`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated by `func_4()`, 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= 10^12, `n` is not equal to 0, `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`, and `func_5(l)` has been called.**
