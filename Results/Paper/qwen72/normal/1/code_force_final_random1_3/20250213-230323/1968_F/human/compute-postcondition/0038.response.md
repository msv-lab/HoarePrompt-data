The value of `idx` is incremented by 2. The initial value of `idx` is `3 + n`, so after the increment, `idx` becomes `3 + n + 2`, which simplifies to `5 + n`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `5 + n`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and is greater than or equal to 2, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `results` is an empty list, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `mp` is a dictionary, `l` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`.**
