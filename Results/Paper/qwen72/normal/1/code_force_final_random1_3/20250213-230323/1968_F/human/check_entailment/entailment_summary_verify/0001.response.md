### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It iterates through the list to parse the number of test cases, the size of the array, the number of queries, and the elements of the array and queries.
   - This approach is efficient and appropriate for the given constraints.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - It also maintains a dictionary `mp` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
   - This is a crucial step for efficiently handling the queries.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XOR array.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is zero, it means the subarray is interesting, and the program appends 'YES' to the results.
   - If the XOR is not zero, it checks if there exist indices `i` and `j` such that `pf[i] == pf[r]` and `pf[j] == pf[l-1]` and `l <= i <= r` and `l <= j <= r`. This is done using binary search with the `bisect` module.
   - The logic here is to find if there are any subarrays within the queried range that have the same prefix XOR, which would imply that the subarray can be split into parts with the same XOR value.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all queries for all test cases, the program prints the results.
   - The output format is correct and matches the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly parses the input and processes each test case and query.
- The logic for determining if a subarray is interesting is sound and follows the problem's requirements.
- The use of prefix XOR and binary search ensures efficient query processing.
- The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: **True**
