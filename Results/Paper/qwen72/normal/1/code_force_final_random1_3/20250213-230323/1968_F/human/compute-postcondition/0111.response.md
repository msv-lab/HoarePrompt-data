Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `a[3]` is set to `int(data[idx-1])`, `idx` is increased by 1, `pf[3]` is set to `pf[2] ^ a[3]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `pf[3]` is updated to the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `pf[2]` and `a[3]`. All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
