Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is 5, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, each test case consists of two integers `n` and `q` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, the array `a` contains `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[3])` and `a[2]` which is now `int(data[4])`, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `results` is an empty list, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is `int(data[3])` and the value is a list containing `[1]`, `i` is 2, `pf[1]` is `int(data[3])`, `pf[2]` is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The line `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` updates the value of `pf[2]` to be the result of the XOR operation between `pf[1]` and `a[2]`.
- `pf[1]` is `int(data[3])`.
- `a[2]` is `int(data[4])`.
- Therefore, `pf[2]` is calculated as `int(data[3]) ^ int(data[4])`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
