Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `3 + n + 2 * q`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where the prefix XOR equals that key, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end, `q` is now the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`.**
