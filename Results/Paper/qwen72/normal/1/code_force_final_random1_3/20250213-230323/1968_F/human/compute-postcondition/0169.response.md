The code snippet `idx += 2` increments the value of `idx` by 2. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- `idx` was initially defined as `3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1 + 2 * q`. After the increment, `idx` becomes `3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1 + 2 * q + 2`.

All other variables (`t`, `data`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `results`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1 + 2 * q + 2`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` is set to `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to index `i`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end, and `i` is `n`.**
