Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `4 + n + 2 * q + n + 1 + 2 * q + 2`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[1]` is `int(data[idx - 1])` and `a[2]` is `int(data[idx])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers initialized to 0, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1]}`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end, `i` is 2, and `pf[1]` is `a[1]`.**
