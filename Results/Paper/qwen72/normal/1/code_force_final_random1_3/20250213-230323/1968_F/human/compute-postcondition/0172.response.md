Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1 + 2 * q + 2`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers initialized to 0, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers initialized to 0, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{0: [0]}`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end, and `i` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `mp = {(0): [0]}` updates the dictionary `mp` to contain a single key-value pair where the key is `0` and the value is a list containing `[0]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `data`, `idx`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `results`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
