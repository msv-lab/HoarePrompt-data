Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `3 + n + 2 * q + n + 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` is set to `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to index `i`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional element at the end. If `x` (which is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`) is equal to 0, the last element of `results` is 'YES'. Otherwise, the last element of `results` remains an empty string. `i` is `n`, `l` is `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1])`, `r` is `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + n + 2])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[r]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])` retrieves the list of indices from the dictionary `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[r]`. If `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`, `v1` is set to an empty list `[]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
