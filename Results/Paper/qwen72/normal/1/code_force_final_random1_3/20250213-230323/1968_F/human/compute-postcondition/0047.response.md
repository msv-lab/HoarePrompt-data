Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `5 + n`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and is greater than or equal to 2, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' if `x` is 0, otherwise `results` remains an empty list, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `l` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the value associated with `pf[r]` in the dictionary `mp` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`, `v2` is the value associated with `pf[l - 1]` in the dictionary `mp` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost element in `v1` that is greater than or equal to `l`, `it2` is the index of the rightmost element in `v2` that is less than `r`.**

Explanation:
- The code `it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1` calculates the index of the rightmost element in `v2` that is less than `r`. This is done using the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module, which finds the insertion point for `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order, and then subtracts 1 to get the index of the element just before `r`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
