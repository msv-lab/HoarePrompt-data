Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `3 + n`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and is greater than or equal to 2, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, each test case consists of two integers `n` and `q` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, the array `a` contains `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `a[1]` to `a[n]` which are populated with the integer values from `data[3]` to `data[3 + n - 1]`, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `results` is an empty list, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where the prefix XOR equals that key.**
