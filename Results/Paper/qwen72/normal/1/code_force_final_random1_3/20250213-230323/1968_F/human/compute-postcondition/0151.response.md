Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `5 + n + 2 * q + n + 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` is set to `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to index `i`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional element at the end. `i` is `n`, `l` is `int(data[idx])`, `r` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[r]`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[l - 1]`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index in `v2` where `r` would be inserted to maintain sorted order minus 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `r = int(data[idx + 1])` updates the value of `r` to be the integer value of the element in the `data` list at the index `idx + 1`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- The updated value of `r` is now `int(data[idx + 1])`.
