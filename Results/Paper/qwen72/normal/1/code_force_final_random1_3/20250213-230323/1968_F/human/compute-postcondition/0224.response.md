Output State: **`v2` is updated to the list associated with the key `pf[l - 1]` in the dictionary `mp`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`. `it1` is the index of the first element in `v1` that is greater than or equal to `l`. All other variables (`_`, `it2`, `results`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`) remain unchanged.**
