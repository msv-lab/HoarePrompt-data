To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input
- `idx` is `4 + n + 2 * q + n + 1 + 2 * q + 2`
- `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be greater than 0
- `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`
- `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[1]` is now `int(data[idx - 1])`
- `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers initialized to 0
- `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1]}`
- `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end
- `i` is 1
- `pf[1]` is `a[1]`

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1` (exclusive), meaning the loop will run `n` times.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
- The condition `i < n + 1` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `4 + n + 2 * q + n + 1 + 2 * q + 2`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[1]` is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers initialized to 0, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1]}`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end, `i` is 2, and `pf[1]` is `a[1]`**
