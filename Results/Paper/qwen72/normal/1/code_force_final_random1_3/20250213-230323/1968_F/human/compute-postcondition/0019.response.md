Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is 4, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, each test case consists of two integers `n` and `q` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, the array `a` contains `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[3])`, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `results` is an empty list, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is `int(data[3])` and the value is a list containing `[1]`, `i` is 1, `pf[1]` is `int(data[3])`.**

Explanation:
- The code `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the list associated with the key `pf[1]` in the dictionary `mp`.
- Since `pf[1]` is `int(data[3])`, the list associated with the key `int(data[3])` in `mp` is updated to contain `[1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
