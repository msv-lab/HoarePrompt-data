Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `3 + n + 2 * q + n + 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` is set to `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to index `i`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional 'YES' at the end, `i` is `n`, `l` is `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1])`, `r` is `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + n + 2])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and `x` is equal to 0, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
