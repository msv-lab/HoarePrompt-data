Output State: **`it1` is the index in `v1` such that `v1[it1]` is the first element in `v1` that is greater than or equal to `l`, `it2` is the index in `v2` such that `v2[it2]` is the last element in `v2` that is less than `r`. Additionally, `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`. The list `results` now contains the string 'YES'.**
