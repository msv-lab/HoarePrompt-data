Output State: **t is the integer value of `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is 0, each test case consists of two integers n and q where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, the array a contains n integers a_1, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, each query is represented by two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases and the sum of q over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
