Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `5 + n`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and is greater than or equal to 2, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' if `x` is 0, otherwise `results` remains an empty list, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `l` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the value associated with `pf[r]` in the dictionary `mp` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`. If `x` is 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
