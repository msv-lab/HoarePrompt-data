Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is 4, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, each test case consists of two integers n and q where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, the array `a` contains `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[3])`, each query is represented by two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases and the sum of q over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `results` is an empty list, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is (0) and the value is a list containing a single element [0], `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
