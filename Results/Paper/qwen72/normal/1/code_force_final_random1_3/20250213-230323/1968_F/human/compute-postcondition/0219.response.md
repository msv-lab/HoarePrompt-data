Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `it1` is the index in `v1` such that `v1[it1]` is the first element in `v1` that is greater than or equal to the new value of `l`, and `it2` is the index in `v2` such that `v2[it2]` is the last element in `v2` that is less than the new value of `r`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to the new value of `l`, then the list `results` contains the strings 'YES' (one additional 'YES' added). Otherwise, either `it1` is equal to or greater than the length of `v1`, or `it2` is less than 0, or `v1[it1]` is greater than `r`, or `v2[it2]` is less than the new value of `l`, and the list `results` contains the strings 'NO' (one additional 'YES' added). `l` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, and `r` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`. `idx` is incremented by 2. `x` is now equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.**
