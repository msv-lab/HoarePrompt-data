Postcondition: ***`v2` is updated to the list associated with the key `pf[l - 1]` in the dictionary `mp`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`. `it1` is the index of the first element in `v1` that is greater than or equal to `l`. `it2` is the index of the last element in `v2` that is less than `r`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r` and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, then `results` includes the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` includes the string 'NO'. All other variables (`_`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`) remain unchanged.***
