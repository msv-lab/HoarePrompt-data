The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n_cases`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n_cases` is greater than 1

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2
- `n_cases` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 2, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1. If `n` is greater than or equal to `power - 1`, then if `power` equals `n`, `power` remains `n + 1`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `n`, and `power` is not equal to `n + 1`. If `n` is not 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1.**
