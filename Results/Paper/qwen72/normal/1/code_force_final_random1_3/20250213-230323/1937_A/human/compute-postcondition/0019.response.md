Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `power - 1`.
   - `power` is `n`.
   - `power` is not equal to `n + 1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `n_cases` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
   - `n` is an integer such that `n >= power - 1`.
   - `power` is equal to `n`.
   - Since `power` is equal to `n`, the condition `power != n + 1` is always true because `n` cannot be equal to `n + 1`.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2 ** power)
   ```

4. **Calculating the Output:**
   - The expression `2 ** power` computes 2 raised to the power of `power`.
   - From the initial state, we know that `power` is equal to `n`.
   - Therefore, the expression becomes `2 ** n`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the result of `2 ** n`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the value of `2 ** n`.

Output: **2 ** n (where n is the value of n and power is equal to n)**
