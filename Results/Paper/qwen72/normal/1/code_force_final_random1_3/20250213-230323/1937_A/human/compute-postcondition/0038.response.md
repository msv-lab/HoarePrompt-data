The value of `power` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer and `power` was not equal to `n`, after decrementing `power` by 1, `power` is still not equal to `n`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer, `power` is not equal to `n`, and `power` is now `power - 1`.**
