The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `power` must be less than `n`.

- Right before the loop, `power` is 1.
- `n` is defined as `log2(n)`, but this definition seems circular and might be a typo or a misunderstanding. Assuming `n` is meant to be a positive number (since `n_cases` must be greater than 0 and `n` is derived from `n_cases` in some way, likely through a logarithmic transformation), `n` should be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given that `power` starts at 1, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. Since `n` is derived from `n_cases` and `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` should be a valid positive number greater than 1.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `power` since it already satisfies the condition to enter the loop when `n` is greater than 1. However, we need to ensure that `n` is indeed greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `power` is 1**
