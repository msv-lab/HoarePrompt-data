Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n_cases` is greater than 1.
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer.
- `power` is equal to `n`.
- The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `n` and `power`:**
   - `n` is defined as the base-2 logarithm of the input integer. This means if the input integer is \( x \), then \( n = \log_2(x) \).
   - `power` is set to be equal to `n`.

2. **Calculating the Output:**
   - The print statement `print(2 ** power)` will compute \( 2 \) raised to the power of `power`.
   - Since `power` is equal to `n`, and `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer \( x \), we have:
     \[
     2 ** power = 2 ** n = 2 ** \log_2(x) = x
     \]
   - Therefore, the print statement will output the original input integer \( x \).

### Final Output:
Output: **x (where x is the input integer whose base-2 logarithm is n)**
