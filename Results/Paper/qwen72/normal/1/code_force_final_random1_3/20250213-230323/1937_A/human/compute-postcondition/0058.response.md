Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n_cases` is greater than 2.
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer.
- `power` is `power - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `power`**:
   - The initial state mentions that `power` is `power - 1`. This implies that `power` is being decremented by 1 from some initial value.
   - However, the initial value of `power` is not explicitly given. We need to infer it from the context.

2. **Understanding `n`**:
   - `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer. Let's denote the input integer as `x`. Therefore, `n = log2(x)`.
   - Since `n` is the base-2 logarithm of `x`, `x` can be expressed as `2^n`.

3. **Understanding `power` in relation to `n`**:
   - If `power` is initially `n` and then decremented by 1, then `power` would be `n - 1`.
   - Therefore, `2 ** power` would be `2 ** (n - 1)`.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - Since `n = log2(x)`, we have `2 ** (n - 1) = 2 ** (log2(x) - 1)`.
   - Using the properties of logarithms, `2 ** (log2(x) - 1) = 2 ** log2(x) / 2 = x / 2`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the value of `2 ** power`, which is `x / 2` where `x` is the input integer.

Output: **x / 2 (where x is the input integer)**
