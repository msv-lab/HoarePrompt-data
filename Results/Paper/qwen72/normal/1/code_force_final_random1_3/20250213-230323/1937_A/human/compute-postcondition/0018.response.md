Output State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to `power - 1`, `power` is `n`, and `power` is not equal to `n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `power` is decremented by 1, so `power` is now equal to `n`.
- The conditions `n_cases` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0 remain unchanged.
- The condition `n` must be greater than or equal to `power - 1` remains valid because `power` is now `n`.
- The condition `power` is not equal to `n + 1` is updated to reflect the new value of `power`, which is now `n`.
