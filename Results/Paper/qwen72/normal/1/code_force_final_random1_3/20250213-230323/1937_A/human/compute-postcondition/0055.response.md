Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n_cases` is greater than 2.
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer.
- `power` is equal to `n`.
- The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `n`**: 
   - `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer. This means if the input integer is \( x \), then \( n = \log_2(x) \).

2. **Value of `power`**:
   - `power` is equal to `n`, so `power` is also \( \log_2(x) \).

3. **Expression `2 ** power`**:
   - The expression `2 ** power` calculates \( 2 \) raised to the power of `power`.
   - Since `power` is \( \log_2(x) \), the expression becomes \( 2^{\log_2(x)} \).

4. **Simplification**:
   - By the properties of logarithms, \( 2^{\log_2(x)} = x \).

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the value of the input integer \( x \).

### Final Output:
Output: **x (where x is the input integer)**
