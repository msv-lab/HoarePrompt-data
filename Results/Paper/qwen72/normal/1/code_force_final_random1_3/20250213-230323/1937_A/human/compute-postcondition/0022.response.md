The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n_cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n_cases` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n_cases` must still be greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1. If `n` is greater than or equal to `power - 1`, then if `power` equals `n`, `power` remains `n + 1`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `n`, and `power` is not equal to `n + 1`.**
