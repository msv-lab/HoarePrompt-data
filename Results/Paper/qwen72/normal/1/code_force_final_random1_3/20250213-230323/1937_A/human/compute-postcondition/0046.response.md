The value of `n` is updated to the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `n`. The other variables (`i`, `n_cases`, `power`) remain unchanged. Since the exact value of `n` before the operation is not specified, we can only say that `n` is now the base-2 logarithm of its original value.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 2, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer, `power` is 1.**
