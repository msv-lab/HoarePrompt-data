Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n_cases` is greater than 1.
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer.
- `power` is not equal to `n`.
- `power` is now `power - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `n`**:
   - `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer. This means if the input integer is \( x \), then \( n = \log_2(x) \).

2. **Understanding `power`**:
   - Initially, `power` is some value that is not equal to `n`.
   - After the initial state, `power` is decremented by 1, so `power` becomes `power - 1`.

3. **Calculating the Output**:
   - The code snippet `print(2 ** power)` will print \( 2 \) raised to the power of the current value of `power`.
   - Since `power` is now `power - 1`, the value being printed is \( 2^{(power - 1)} \).

### Final Output:
The code will print \( 2 \) raised to the power of the current value of `power`, which is `power - 1`.

Output: **2 ** (power - 1) (where power is the value of power after being decremented by 1)**
