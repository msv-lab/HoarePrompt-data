The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 2, and `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer, which is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must remain greater than 2, and `power` should be less than `n`.

Since `n` is already greater than 2, no adjustment is needed for `n`. However, to ensure the loop executes again, `power` should be less than `n`. Given that `power` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2, the loop can indeed execute again without any adjustments.

State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 2, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer and is greater than 2, `power` is 2**
