Output State: **`i` is 200000, `pd[200000]` contains the cumulative sum of all previous elements in `pd` plus the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to 199999, `t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The values of `i`, `pd[200000]`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and retains the initial values of the other variables.
