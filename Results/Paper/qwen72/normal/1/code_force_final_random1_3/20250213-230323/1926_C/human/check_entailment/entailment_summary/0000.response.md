Reasoning:  
The program appears to be correctly solving the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Precomputation**: The program precomputes the cumulative sum of digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores these values in the list `A`. This is efficient because it allows each test case to be answered in constant time by simply looking up the precomputed value.

2. **Digit Sum Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number. It iterates through each digit of the number, adding it to a running total, and then divides the number by 10 to move to the next digit. This process continues until the number is reduced to 0.

3. **Cumulative Sum Storage**: The program maintains a cumulative sum in the list `A`. For each number `i` from 1 to 200,000, it calculates the sum of the digits using `func_1`, adds this to the running total `sum`, and appends the result to `A`.

4. **Test Case Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the input `n` and printing the precomputed cumulative sum from the list `A` at index `n-1`.

5. **Efficiency**: The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, where n is 200,000. Each test case is handled in O(1) time due to the precomputation, which is efficient enough to meet the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Given the above points, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
