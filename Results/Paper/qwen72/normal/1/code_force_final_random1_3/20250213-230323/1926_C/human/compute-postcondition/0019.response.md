The code `pd[i] += int(j)` updates the value of `pd[i]` by adding the integer value of `j` to it. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is `'2'`, the integer value of `j` is 2. Therefore, `pd[2]` is updated to `pd[2] + 2`. Since the initial state specifies that `pd[2]` is `pd[2] + pd[1] + 4`, the new value of `pd[2]` becomes `pd[2] + pd[1] + 4 + 2`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `'2'`, `N` must be greater than 2, `pd[2]` is now `pd[2] + pd[1] + 6`**
