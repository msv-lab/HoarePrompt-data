The value of `num` is updated to the integer division of the original `num` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `num`. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is the sum of the last digits of the original `num` and the current `num` before this operation. Since the last digit of the original `num` does not change and the last digit of the current `num` (before the operation) is used in the calculation of `a`, `a` remains the same.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 0 < num <= 2000 (since the last digit is removed), `a` is the last digit of the original `num` plus the last digit of the original `num` before the division.**
