To determine what will be printed by the `print(pd[n])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 200000.
- `pd[200000]` contains the cumulative sum of all previous elements in `pd` plus the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to 199999.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.

### Explanation:
- The variable `pd` is a dictionary or list where `pd[200000]` is specifically defined.
- The value of `pd[200000]` is the cumulative sum of all previous elements in `pd` plus the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to 199999.
- The variable `n` is an input integer, and we need to determine the value of `pd[n]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `pd[200000]`**:
   - `pd[200000]` is the cumulative sum of all previous elements in `pd` plus the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to 199999.
   - This means `pd[200000]` is a specific value that is precomputed and stored in the dictionary or list `pd`.

2. **Determining `pd[n]`**:
   - The value of `pd[n]` depends on the input integer `n`.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 200000, `pd[n]` will be the value stored in the dictionary or list at index `n`.
   - If `n` is greater than 200000, the value of `pd[n]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine it precisely without additional information.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the value of `pd[n]` where `n` is the input integer. Since the exact value of `pd[n]` is not explicitly provided for all possible values of `n`, we can only describe it in general terms.

Output: **pd[n] (where pd[n] is the value stored in the dictionary or list pd at index n)**
