The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `j`, and the conversion of `i` to a string. The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is `'2'`, and `N` must be greater than 2. Since `i` is 2, its string representation is `"2"`, and the loop has already processed the single character `'2'`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented or changed to a value that results in a string with more characters. However, since the task specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and `i` is not modified within the loop head, the only adjustment is to the variable `j` as it moves to the next character in the string representation of `i`.

Since `i` is 2 and its string representation is `"2"`, there are no more characters to process, and thus the loop will not execute again unless `i` changes. However, since `i` is not changing, the state remains the same.

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `'2'`, `N` must be greater than 2, `pd[2]` is now `pd[2] + pd[1] + 2`**
