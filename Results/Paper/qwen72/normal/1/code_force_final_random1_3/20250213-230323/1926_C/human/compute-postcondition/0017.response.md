Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `'2'`, `N` must be greater than 2, `pd[2]` is now `pd[2] + pd[1] + 4`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `j` remains `'2'`.
- The condition that `N` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged.
- The line `pd[i] += int(j)` increments `pd[2]` by the integer value of `j`, which is 2. Since `pd[2]` was initially `pd[2] + pd[1] + 2`, adding 2 to it results in `pd[2]` being `pd[2] + pd[1] + 4`.
