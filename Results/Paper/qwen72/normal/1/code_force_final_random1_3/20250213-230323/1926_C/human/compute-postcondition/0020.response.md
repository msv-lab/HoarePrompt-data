Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `'2'`, `N` must be greater than 2, `pd[2]` is now `pd[2] + pd[1] + 2 * len(str(i))`**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. Since `i` is 2, `str(i)` is `'2'`, which has a length of 1.
- Each iteration of the loop adds the integer value of the character (which is 2) to `pd[i]`.
- After the first iteration, `pd[2]` is incremented by 2.
- After the second iteration, `pd[2]` is incremented by another 2, making it `pd[2] + pd[1] + 4`.
- After the third iteration, `pd[2]` is incremented by another 2, making it `pd[2] + pd[1] + 6`.

Since the loop iterates `len(str(i))` times, and `len(str(i))` is 1, the total increment to `pd[2]` after all iterations is `2 * len(str(i))`, which simplifies to `2 * 1 = 2`.

Therefore, after all iterations, `pd[2]` will be `pd[2] + pd[1] + 2 * len(str(i))`.
