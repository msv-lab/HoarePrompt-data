The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop is controlled by the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `i` and `pd[200000]` are not relevant to the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 200000, `pd[200000]` contains the cumulative sum of all previous elements in `pd` plus the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to 199999, `t` must be greater than 0**
