The code snippet `a = a + num % 10` updates the value of `a` by adding the last digit of `num` to its current value. Given the initial state where `num` is an integer such that 0 < num <= 2000, and `a` is the last digit of the original `num` plus the last digit of the original `num` before the division, the new value of `a` will be the sum of its original value and the last digit of `num`.

Let's break it down:
- The last digit of `num` is obtained by `num % 10`.
- `a` is initially the last digit of the original `num` plus the last digit of the original `num` before the division.
- After executing the code, `a` becomes `a + num % 10`.

Therefore, the updated value of `a` is the sum of its original value (which is the last digit of the original `num` plus the last digit of the original `num` before the division) and the last digit of `num`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 0 < num <= 2000, `a` is the last digit of the original `num` plus the last digit of the original `num` before the division plus the last digit of `num`.**
