The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `N` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `N` must still be greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`i` is 3, `j` is `'2'`, `N` must be greater than 3, `pd[2]` is now `pd[2] + pd[1] + 2 * len(str(i))`**
