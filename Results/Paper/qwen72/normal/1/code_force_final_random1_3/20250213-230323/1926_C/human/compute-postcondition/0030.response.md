Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is 200000, and `pd[200000]` contains the cumulative sum of all previous elements in `pd` plus the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to 199999.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = 199999` (since `N = 200001`).
- For each `i`, `pd[i]` is updated by adding the value of `pd[i-1]` and the sum of the digits of `i`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be 200000 (the last value it takes before the loop condition fails).
- The final value of `pd[200000]` will be the cumulative sum of all previous elements in `pd` plus the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to 199999.
