The variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If `num` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is an integer such that 0 < num <= 2000 (since the last digit is removed). For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must still be a non-zero integer.

State: **`num` is an integer such that 0 < num <= 2000, `a` is the last digit of the original `num` plus the last digit of the original `num` before the division**
