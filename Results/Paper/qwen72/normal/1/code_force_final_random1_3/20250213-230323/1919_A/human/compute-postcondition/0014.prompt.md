Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is the integer value entered by the user for the number of test cases, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
    winner = func_1(a, b)
    results.append(winner)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `a` and `b` are set to the input values, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner` and the new value of `winner` (result of `func_1(a, b)`), `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `a` and `b` are set to the new input values, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `results` is a list containing the value of the previous `winner` and the new value of `winner` (result of `func_1(a, b)`), `a` and `b` are now the new input values from the user, `winner` is the new result of `func_1(a, b)`, and `results` now includes the new `winner` value appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
