Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to verify if the logic implemented in the functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their own.
   - Each player must remove one coin from their current wallet, and the wallet must have at least one coin before removing.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Logic Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function determines the winner based on the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
     - If the sum `(a + b)` is even, Bob wins.
     - If the sum `(a + b)` is odd, Alice wins.
   - **func_2**: This function handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)`, and stores the result.
     - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **func_1**:
     - The logic of determining the winner based on the parity of the sum `(a + b)` is correct because:
       - If `(a + b)` is even, the total number of moves (each move removes one coin) is even. Since Alice starts, she will make the last move, and Bob will be the one who cannot make a move.
       - If `(a + b)` is odd, the total number of moves is odd. Since Alice starts, Bob will make the last move, and Alice will be the one who cannot make a move.
   - **func_2**:
     - The function correctly handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1(a, b)`.
     - It stores the results and prints them, ensuring that the output matches the expected format.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
