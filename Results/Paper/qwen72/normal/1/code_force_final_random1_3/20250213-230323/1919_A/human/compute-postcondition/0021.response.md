Output State: **`results` is a list containing all the results from `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration, and the loop has printed each result in `results` exactly once.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `results` contains all the results that were generated by calling `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration. The loop has printed each of these results exactly once, in the order they appear in the list `results`. The variables `a`, `b`, `t`, and `winner` remain unchanged from their initial state, as they are not modified within the loop.
