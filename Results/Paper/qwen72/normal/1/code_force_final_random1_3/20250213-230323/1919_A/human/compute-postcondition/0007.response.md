Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `a` and `b` are set to the new input values, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**

Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `_`, and `results` remain unchanged.
- The variables `a` and `b` are reassigned to the new input values provided by the user.
- The condition that `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9 still holds.
- The value of `winner` remains the result of `func_1(a, b)`, but `a` and `b` now refer to the new input values.
