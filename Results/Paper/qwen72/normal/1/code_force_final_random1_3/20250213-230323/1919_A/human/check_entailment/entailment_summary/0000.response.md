Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_1` and `func_2` correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or keep their own.
   - Each player must remove one coin from their wallet at the end of their turn.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game is essentially a parity problem. The key observation is that the total number of coins (a + b) determines the outcome.
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win because he can mirror Alice's moves.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win because she can force Bob into a losing position.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
   - This logic is correct based on the key insight.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)`, and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - This function correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the winner for each case.

Given that both functions implement the correct logic and handle the input and output as specified in the problem, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
