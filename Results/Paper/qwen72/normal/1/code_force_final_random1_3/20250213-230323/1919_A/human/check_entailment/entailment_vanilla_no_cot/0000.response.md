Correctness: **True**

The solution provided is correct. The logic in `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if it's odd, Alice wins. This is because the game essentially comes down to whether the total number of moves (which is equal to the total number of coins minus one for each player) is even or odd. Since Alice always makes the first move, she will win if the total number of moves is odd, and Bob will win if it is even. The implementation in `func_2` reads the input correctly and processes each test case using `func_1`, then prints the results, which matches the problem requirements.
