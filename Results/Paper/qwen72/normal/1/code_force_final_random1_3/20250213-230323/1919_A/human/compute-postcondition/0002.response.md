The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and its initial value is not relevant to the loop's execution.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `results` being an empty list and the conditions for `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) are not directly related to the loop's ability to execute, but they are part of the context.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable, `results` is an empty list, and for each test case, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9**
