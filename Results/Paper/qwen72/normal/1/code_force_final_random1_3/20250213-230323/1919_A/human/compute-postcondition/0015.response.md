To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which are `result` and `results`.

- `results` must be a non-empty list for the loop to execute at least once.
- The variable `result` will take on the value of each element in `results` during each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations (this is not directly relevant to the loop's ability to execute, as it is not part of the loop head).
- `_` is a throwaway variable (not used in the loop head).
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration.
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and they are set to the input values for the last iteration.
- `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration.

For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. The state of `result` will be determined by the elements in `results` during each iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `results` is a non-empty list. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, and `winner`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least one result from `func_1(a, b)`, `result` is the first element in `results`**
