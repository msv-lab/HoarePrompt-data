The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If the `results` list has more than one element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least one result from `func_1(a, b)`, and `result` is the first element in `results`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least two elements, and `result` will be the second element in `results`.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least two results from `func_1(a, b)`, `result` is the second element in `results`**
