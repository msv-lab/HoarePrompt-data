Output State: **t is the integer value entered by the user for the number of test cases, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. `results` is an empty list.** 

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state. The list `results` is now ready to store results from the test cases.
