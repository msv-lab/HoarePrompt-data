Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins each has. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins both players start with. The logic implemented in `func_1` correctly identifies that if the sum of the coins is even, Bob will always win, and if it's odd, Alice will always win, assuming both play optimally. This is because the game essentially reduces to a parity game where the player who starts with the odd total (Alice) can always force the game into a state where the other player (Bob) is left with an even total, and vice versa.

- The function `func_1` checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If it is, it returns 'Bob', otherwise, it returns 'Alice'. This logic is correct based on the game rules and optimal play strategy.
- The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1` to determine the winner, and stores the result. Finally, it prints out the results for all test cases. This implementation correctly processes the input and outputs the expected results according to the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem and handles the input and output as specified.

Correctness: **True**
