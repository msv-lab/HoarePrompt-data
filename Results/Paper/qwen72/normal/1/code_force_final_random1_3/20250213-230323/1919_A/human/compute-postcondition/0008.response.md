Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `a` and `b` are set to the new input values, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**

Explanation: The code snippet `winner = func_1(a, b)` updates the value of `winner` to the result of the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are already set to new input values, and `winner` is updated to the result of `func_1(a, b)`, the only change in the state is the value of `winner`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
