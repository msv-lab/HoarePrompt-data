The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `t`. The throwaway variable `_` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs, but since it's a throwaway variable, its specific value isn't tracked. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to have run. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, and `_` will be incremented again.

Given that `t` was greater than 0 at the end of the last iteration, for the next iteration, `t` must now be greater than or equal to 1 (since `_` is incremented by 1). However, since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to specify its exact value, only that it will be incremented.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `a` and `b` are set to the input values, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**
