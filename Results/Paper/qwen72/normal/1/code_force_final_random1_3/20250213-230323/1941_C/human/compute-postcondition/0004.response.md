The code snippet `y = s.count('pie')` counts the occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `y`.

- The value of `y` is now the number of times 'pie' appears in the string `s`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.**
