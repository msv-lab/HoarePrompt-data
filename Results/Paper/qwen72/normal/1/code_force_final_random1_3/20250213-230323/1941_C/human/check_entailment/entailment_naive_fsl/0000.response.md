Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and prints their sum. This approach is incorrect because:

1. It does not account for overlapping occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie".
2. It does not calculate the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

For example, consider the input string "mappie":
- The program will count "map" once and "pie" once, resulting in 2.
- However, to make the string beautiful, only 1 deletion is needed (removing the 'p' between "map" and "pie").

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
