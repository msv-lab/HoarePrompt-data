Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the new input integer greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `s` is updated to the new input string provided by the user.
- The values of `_`, `t`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- `x` and `y` still represent the number of times 'map' and 'pie' appear in the new `s`, respectively, but these values will be recalculated based on the new input string.
