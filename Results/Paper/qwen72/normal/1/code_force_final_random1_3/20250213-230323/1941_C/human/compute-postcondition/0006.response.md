To determine what will be printed by the `print(x + y)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is 0.
   - `a` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `x` is the number of times the substring 'map' appears in `s`.
   - `y` is the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in `s`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `x` is calculated by counting the occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`.
   - `y` is calculated by counting the occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(x + y)` statement will print the sum of the number of times 'map' appears in `s` and the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `x` and `y`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`.

Output: **x + y (where x is the number of times 'map' appears in s and y is the number of times 'pie' appears in s)**
