The value of `a` is updated to the new input integer, which is specified to be greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.**
