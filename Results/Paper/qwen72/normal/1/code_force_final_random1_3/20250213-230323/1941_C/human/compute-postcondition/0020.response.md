The function `func` is described with certain parameter constraints but lacks explicit parameters in its definition. Based on the provided constraints, the function likely processes multiple test cases, each involving a string of lowercase Latin letters. However, without specific parameters listed in the function definition, I'll assume the function implicitly handles these inputs through some means (e.g., global variables, file input, etc.).

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, representing the length of the string `s`.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

The function's output is not explicitly defined in the problem statement, so I'll infer that the function processes each test case and returns some result based on the string `s`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a string `s` of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a result for each test case, though the specific nature of the result is not defined in the given information.**
