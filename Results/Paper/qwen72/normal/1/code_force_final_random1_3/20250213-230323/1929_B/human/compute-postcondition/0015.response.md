Initial State: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from input.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t`: An integer input where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. This variable is not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - `_`: Incremented by 1. This variable is also not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - `n`: An integer read from input. This variable is not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - `k`: An integer read from input. This variable is used in the `print` statement.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `k // 2`: This performs integer division of `k` by 2, which means it returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result of `k / 2`.
   - `k // 2 + 1`: After performing the integer division, 1 is added to the result.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The expression `k // 2 + 1` will always yield an integer value that is one more than half of `k` (rounded down).

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the integer read from input)**
