Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers derived from the input file `s`. If `k` is 4 * n - 2, the value of `k` remains 4 * n - 2. Otherwise, if `k` is less than or equal to 4 * n - 4, the value of `k` remains as it is; if `k` is exactly 4 * n - 3, the value of `k` remains 4 * n - 3; if `k` is greater than 4 * n - 4 and not equal to 4 * n - 3 or 4 * n - 2, the value of `k` remains unchanged, which could be any value greater than 4 * n - 4.***
