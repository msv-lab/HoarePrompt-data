Given the initial state:

- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- The equation \(4 \times n - 2\) equals `k`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the following code snippet:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Equation:**
   - The equation given is \(4 \times n - 2 = k\).
   - This means `k` is always an even number because \(4 \times n\) is always even, and subtracting 2 from an even number results in another even number.

2. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - We need to evaluate the expression `k // 2 + 1`.
   - Since `k` is even, `k // 2` will be an integer.
   - Adding 1 to this integer will give us the final result.

3. **Substituting the Equation:**
   - From the equation \(4 \times n - 2 = k\), we can solve for `k`:
     \[
     k = 4 \times n - 2
     \]
   - Now, substitute `k` into the expression `k // 2 + 1`:
     \[
     (4 \times n - 2) // 2 + 1
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     (4 \times n - 2) // 2 = 2 \times n - 1
     \]
     \[
     2 \times n - 1 + 1 = 2 \times n
     \]

4. **Final Result:**
   - The expression `k // 2 + 1` simplifies to `2 * n`.

### Conclusion:
The code will print the value of `2 * n`.

Output: **2 * n (where n is the input integer)**
