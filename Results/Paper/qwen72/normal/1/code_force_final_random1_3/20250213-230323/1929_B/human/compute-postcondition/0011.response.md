To determine what will be printed by the `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration.
   - `n` is the first integer from the new input.
   - `k` is the second integer from the new input.
   - The condition \(4 \times n - 2\) equals `k` or does not equal `k` based on the new values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Understanding the Condition**:
   - The condition \(4 \times n - 2 = k\) is given. This means that `k` is derived from `n` using the formula \(k = 4 \times n - 2\).

3. **Calculating `k / 2`**:
   - Given \(k = 4 \times n - 2\), we need to calculate \(k / 2\):
     \[
     k / 2 = \frac{4 \times n - 2}{2} = 2 \times n - 1
     \]

4. **Applying the Ceiling Function**:
   - The `ceil` function rounds up to the nearest integer. Since \(2 \times n - 1\) is already an integer, applying `ceil` to it will not change its value:
     \[
     \text{ceil}(2 \times n - 1) = 2 \times n - 1
     \]

5. **Final Output**:
   - The `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement will print the value of \(2 \times n - 1\).

Therefore, the output of the `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement is:
Output: **2 * n - 1 (where n is the first integer from the new input)**
