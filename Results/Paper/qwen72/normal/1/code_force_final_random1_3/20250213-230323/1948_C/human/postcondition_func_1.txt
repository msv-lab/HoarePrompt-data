The function reads a series of test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads two integers and two strings, processes them using another function `func_1`, and collects the results. Finally, it prints each result on a new line. The function does not return any value but modifies the program state by printing the results to the standard output. The number of results printed matches the number of test cases provided initially.
