Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd, or `n-2` if `n` is even, `_` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues if `_` is less than `t`. The program prints 'yes' if it did not break out of the loop during any iteration.**
