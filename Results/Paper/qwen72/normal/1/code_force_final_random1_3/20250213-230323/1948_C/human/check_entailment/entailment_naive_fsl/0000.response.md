Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the condition used to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Specifically, the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` and `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` do not correctly capture all scenarios where the robot cannot reach the target cell. 

For example, consider the following test case:
```
n = 4
a = "><><"
b = "><><"
```
In this case, the robot starts at (1, 1) and the path would be:
- (1, 1) -> (1, 2) (due to the arrow in (1, 1))
- (1, 2) -> (2, 2) (due to the arrow in (1, 2))
- (2, 2) -> (2, 1) (due to the arrow in (2, 2))
- (2, 1) -> (1, 1) (due to the arrow in (2, 1))

The robot gets stuck in a loop and cannot reach (2, 4). However, the program does not detect this and incorrectly prints "yes" for this case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
