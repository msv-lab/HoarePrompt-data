To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`.

- The variable `_` is a placeholder used in the loop to indicate that the loop variable itself is not used within the loop body. This means we don't need to adjust `_` specifically.
- The variable `t` represents the number of test cases and is crucial for determining how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

Since `t` is already defined to be at least 1, it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
