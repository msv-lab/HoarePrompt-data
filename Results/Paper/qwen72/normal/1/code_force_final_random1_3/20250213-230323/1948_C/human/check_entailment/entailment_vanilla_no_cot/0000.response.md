Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The logic in the provided function does not correctly handle all scenarios where the robot can or cannot reach the target cell (2, n). Specifically, the conditions inside the loop are not sufficient to ensure that the robot can navigate through the grid to reach the target cell.

Here are some issues with the provided solution:

1. **Incorrect Condition for Blocking**: The condition `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':` is not correctly identifying all blocking scenarios. It only checks specific positions and does not consider the overall path the robot can take.

2. **Path Traversal Logic**: The robot's movement should be more thoroughly checked to ensure it can move from (1, 1) to (2, n) without getting stuck. The current logic does not simulate the robot's movement step-by-step, which is necessary to determine if the robot can reach the target.

A more accurate approach would involve simulating the robot's movements step-by-step and checking if it can reach the target cell (2, n). Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Initialize the starting position
        row, col = 1, 1
        
        # Simulate the robot's movement
        while col <= n:
            if row == 1:
                if a[col-1] == '>':
                    col += 1
                else:
                    row = 2
            else:
                if b[col-1] == '>':
                    col += 1
                else:
                    row = 1
            
            # Check if the robot has reached the target cell
            if row == 2 and col == n:
                print('Yes')
                break
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This corrected version simulates the robot's movement step-by-step and checks if it can reach the target cell (2, n). If the robot reaches the target cell, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. This approach ensures that all possible paths are considered, making the solution more robust and correct.
