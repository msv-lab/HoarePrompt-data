The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 2 because the range starts from 1 and increments by 2. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 3 (since the first value of `i` is 1, and the next possible value would be 3, requiring `n` to be at least 3 to include 1).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is at least 3, and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1**
