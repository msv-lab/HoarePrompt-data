Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is an input string.
- `i` is 1.
- The condition is either:
  - `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<')` or
  - `(a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'No'`.
- The initial state provides conditions involving the strings `a` and `b` and the integer `i`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'No'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `i`.

Output: **No**
