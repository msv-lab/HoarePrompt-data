To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `obj` is the first string in `command`.
   - `com` is the second string in `command`.
   - `pos` is the value associated with `obj` in the dictionary `elements`.
   - `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
   - `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`.
   - `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Breaking Down the Print Statement:**
   - `%d` is a placeholder for an integer, which will be replaced by the value of `time`.
   - `%s` is a placeholder for a string, which will be replaced by the value of `GoalName[team]`.

4. **Determining the Values:**
   - `time`: This is a variable that represents the current time. Since the exact value of `time` is not provided in the initial state, we will refer to it as `time`.
   - `team`: This is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`. The exact value of `team` depends on the implementation of `goalIn(pos)`, but it should return a key that exists in the `GoalName` dictionary.
   - `GoalName[team]`: This is the value associated with the key `team` in the `GoalName` dictionary. The exact string will depend on the value of `team`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the current time followed by the string associated with the `team` in the `GoalName` dictionary, followed by "GOAL".

Given the initial state and the structure of the print statement, the output will be:

Output: **[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL (where [time] is the value of the time variable and [GoalName[team]] is the string associated with the team in the GoalName dictionary)**
