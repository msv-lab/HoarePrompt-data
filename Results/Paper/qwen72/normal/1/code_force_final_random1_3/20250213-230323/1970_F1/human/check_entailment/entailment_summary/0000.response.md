### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the dimensions of the field (`n` and `m`), the initial state of the field, and the number of steps (`t`).
   - It initializes the `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, and `points` variables appropriately.
   - The `elements` dictionary keeps track of the positions of all entities (players, goals, and the Quaffle).
   - The `allPlayers` dictionary tracks whether a player is carrying the Quaffle.
   - The `goal` list stores the positions of the goals for each team.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - The function processes each command in the sequence of steps.
   - For movement commands (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), it updates the position of the entity.
   - For catching the Quaffle (`C`), it updates the `allPlayers` dictionary to indicate that the player is now carrying the Quaffle.
   - For throwing the Quaffle (`T`), it updates the `allPlayers` dictionary to indicate that the player is no longer carrying the Quaffle.
   - It checks if the player is at a goal position using the `goalIn` function and updates the score accordingly.
   - It handles the special case where a player scores in their own goal by awarding the point to the opposing team.

3. **Scoring and Elimination:**
   - The function correctly prints the scoring events and updates the scores.
   - It also handles the elimination of players when a bludger (`B`) hits a player.

4. **Final Score:**
   - After processing all commands, the function prints the final score of the game.

5. **Helper Functions:**
   - The `goalIn` function correctly identifies if a position is a goal for the red or blue team.
   - The `isPlayer` function correctly identifies if an entity is a player.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly simulates the Quidditch game according to the problem description. It handles all the required actions, updates the game state appropriately, and prints the final score. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
