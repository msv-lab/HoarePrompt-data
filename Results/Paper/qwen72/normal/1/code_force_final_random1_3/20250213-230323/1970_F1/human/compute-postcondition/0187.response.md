Output State: **`obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `pos` is the value associated with `obj` in the dictionary `elements`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`. All other variables remain unchanged.** 

In natural language: The value of `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, which is calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. The values of `obj`, `com`, `pos`, and `nxt` remain the same as they were in the initial state, and no other variables are affected.
