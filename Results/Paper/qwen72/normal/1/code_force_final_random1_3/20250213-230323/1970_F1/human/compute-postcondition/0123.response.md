Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **`n`**: A specific integer read from the input.
2. **`i`**: `n-1`.
3. **`m`**: A specific integer read from the input.
4. **`grid`**: A list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of strings.
5. **`elements`**: A dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)` and an entry for each string `s` in any `line` that is not '..' with the value `(i, index_of_s)`.
6. **`points`**: A list of two integers `[0, 0]`.
7. **`allPlayers`**: A dictionary with entries for each string `s` in any `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`.
8. **`goal`**: A list containing two lists. For each string `s` in any `line` that is not '..' and has a second character 'G', the tuple `(i, index_of_s)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `s` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.
9. **`t`**: Must be greater than 0.
10. **`time`**: 0.
11. **`command`**: A list of strings obtained from the input line, and the length of `command` is not equal to 3.
12. **`obj`**: The first element of `command`.
13. **`com`**: The second element of `command`.
14. **`pos`**: The coordinate pair `elements[obj]`.
15. **`nxt`**: The new position calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
16. **`player`**: `obj` if `obj` is a player, otherwise `player` is the player at the position `nxt` in the `grid`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`time`**: This is explicitly given as 0.
2. **`player`**: 
   - If `obj` is a player, then `player` is `obj`.
   - Otherwise, `player` is the player at the position `nxt` in the `grid`.

Given the initial state, we need to determine the value of `player`:
- `obj` is the first element of `command`.
- `com` is the second element of `command`.
- `pos` is the coordinate pair `elements[obj]`.
- `nxt` is calculated based on `mov[com]`, but since `mov` is not provided, we assume it is a predefined dictionary of movements.

Since the exact values of `command`, `elements`, and `mov` are not provided, we can only describe the output in general terms.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the current time (which is 0) and the name of the player who is eliminated. The player is either the `obj` itself if it is a player, or the player found at the new position `nxt` in the `grid`.

Output: **0 [player] ELIMINATED (where [player] is the name of the player who is eliminated, either `obj` or the player at position `nxt` in the grid)**
