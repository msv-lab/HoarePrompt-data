The code snippet `points[team] += 10` increments the value of `points[team]` by 10. The value of `team` is determined based on the first character of the first element of the `command` list. If `obj[0]` (which is `command[0][0]`) is 'B', then `team` is 1; otherwise, `team` is 0.

Given the initial state:
- `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line.
- `obj` is the first element of `command`.
- `com` is the second element of `command`.
- `el` is the third element of `command`.
- `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.

After executing the code:
- If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1, and `points[1]` is incremented by 10.
- If `obj[0]` is not 'B', then `team` is 0, and `points[0]` is incremented by 10.

The other variables (`command`, `obj`, `com`, `el`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`, `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, `points[team]` is incremented by 10.**
