Postcondition: ***`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `pos` is the value associated with `obj` in the dictionary `elements`, `nxt` is a tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is `.B`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. Otherwise, the values of `command`, `obj`, `com`, `pos`, and `nxt` remain unchanged.***
