The code snippet attempts to unpack the list `command` into three variables: `obj`, `com`, and `el`. Since `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, the length of `command` must be exactly 3 for this operation to succeed. If `command` contains exactly three elements, each element will be assigned to `obj`, `com`, and `el` respectively.

Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`.**
