Output State: **`n` and `m` are specific integers read from the input, `grid` is an empty list, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)`, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is a list of two integers representing the current scores of the red and blue teams.**

Explanation: The code snippet `goal = [[], []]` reassigns the variable `goal` to a new list containing two empty lists. This overrides the previous value of `goal`, which was a list of two lists containing the positions of the goals for the respective teams. All other variables remain unchanged.
