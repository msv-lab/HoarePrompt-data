Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `pos` is the value associated with `obj` in the dictionary `elements`, `nxt` is a tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`.** 

Explanation: The value of `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, which is a tuple calculated by adding the movement values from `mov[com]` to the current position `pos`. All other variables remain unchanged.
