Functionality: ** This function reads and processes a series of inputs to simulate a Quidditch game. It initializes the game state with the dimensions of the playing field, the initial positions of players, the Quaffle, and goals, and the initial scores of both teams. The function then processes a series of commands over a specified number of turns, updating the game state accordingly. Specifically, it handles player movements, the capture of the Golden Snitch, scoring goals, and player eliminations. After processing all commands, it prints the final scores of the red and blue teams. The function does not return any value; it only modifies and prints the game state. **
