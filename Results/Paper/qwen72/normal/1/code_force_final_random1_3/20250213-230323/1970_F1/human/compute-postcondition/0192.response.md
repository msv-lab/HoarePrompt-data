Postcondition: ***`obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `pos` is the value associated with `obj` in the dictionary `elements`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj == '.B' and (isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or (isPlayer(obj) and elements['.B'] == nxt))`, then `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `obj == '.B' and com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. If `obj == '.B' and goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. If `obj == '.B' and com` is not 'T' and `obj` is a player, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `obj` is not '.B', all other variables remain unchanged.***
