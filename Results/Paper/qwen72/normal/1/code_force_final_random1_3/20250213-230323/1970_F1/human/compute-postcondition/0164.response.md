Postcondition: ***`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `pos` is the value associated with `obj` in the dictionary `elements`, `nxt` is a tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is `.B` and `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player, or if `obj` is a player and `nxt` is the position of `.B`, then `player` is set to `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. Otherwise, if `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` does not return -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, and `points[team]` is increased by 1. If `isPlayer(obj)` is true, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If none of these conditions are met, the values of `command`, `obj`, `com`, `pos`, and `nxt` remain unchanged.***
