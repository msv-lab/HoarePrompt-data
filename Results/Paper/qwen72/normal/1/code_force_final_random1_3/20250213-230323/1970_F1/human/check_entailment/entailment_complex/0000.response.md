### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly initializes the game state by reading the dimensions of the field (`n` and `m`), the initial positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle, and the initial scores of both teams.
   - The `elements` dictionary maps each entity (player, goal, Quaffle) to its initial position on the grid.
   - The `allPlayers` dictionary tracks whether each player is currently carrying the Quaffle.
   - The `goal` list stores the positions of the goals for each team.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - The function processes a series of commands over `t` steps, updating the game state accordingly.
   - It handles player movements, the capture of the Quaffle, scoring goals, and player eliminations.
   - The function correctly updates the positions of entities and the scores based on the commands.

3. **Scoring and Elimination:**
   - When a player scores a goal, the function correctly identifies the team that scored and updates the score.
   - The function also handles the case where a player scores in their own goal, awarding the point to the opposing team.
   - Player eliminations are handled by checking if a player moves into a position occupied by another player or if a player moves into a position occupied by the Bludger (`.B`).

4. **Final Output:**
   - After processing all commands, the function prints the final scores of the red and blue teams in the required format.

5. **Helper Functions:**
   - The `goalIn` function correctly determines if a given position is a goal and returns the appropriate team index.
   - The `isPlayer` function correctly identifies if a given entity is a player.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the rules and logic described in the problem statement. It initializes the game state, processes the commands, updates the game state, and outputs the final scores as required.

**Correctness: **True****
