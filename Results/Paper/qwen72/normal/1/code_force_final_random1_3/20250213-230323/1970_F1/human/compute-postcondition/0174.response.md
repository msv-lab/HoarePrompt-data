Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `el` is the third element of `command`.
   - `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.
   - `points[team]` is increased by 10.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `time`: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we assume it is a predefined variable with some integer value.
   - `GoalName[team]`: This depends on the value of `team`.
     - If the first character of `obj` is 'B', then `team` is 1.
     - Otherwise, `team` is 0.
   - `GoalName` is assumed to be a list where `GoalName[0]` and `GoalName[1]` are strings representing the names of the goals for team 0 and team 1, respectively.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If the first character of `obj` is 'B':
     - `team` is 1.
     - The print statement will use `GoalName[1]`.
   - If the first character of `obj` is not 'B':
     - `team` is 0.
     - The print statement will use `GoalName[0]`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will depend on the value of `time` and the value of `GoalName[team]`.

Given the above analysis, the output will be:

Output: **%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where %d is the value of time and %s is the value of GoalName[team], with team being 1 if the first character of obj is 'B', otherwise team is 0)**
