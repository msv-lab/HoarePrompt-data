The code `goal[tmp].append((i, ind))` appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list at index `tmp` in the `goal` list.

- `tmp` is 1, so the tuple `(i, ind)` is appended to `goal[1]`.
- `i` is 0, and `ind` is 0, so the tuple `(0, 0)` is appended to `goal[1]`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the entries `'.B': (-1, -1)` and `line[ind]: (0, 0)`, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `goal` is a list containing two lists, where the first list is empty and the second list contains the tuple `(0, 0)`, `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input that must have at least one string, `ind` is 0, the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..', `line[ind]` is not a player, the second character of the string at `line[ind]` is 'G', and `tmp` is 1.**
