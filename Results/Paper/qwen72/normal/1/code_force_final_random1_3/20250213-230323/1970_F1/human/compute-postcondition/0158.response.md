To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`command`**: This is a list of strings obtained from the input line.
   - `obj` is the first string in `command`.
   - `com` is the second string in `command`.

2. **`pos`**: This is the value associated with `obj` in the dictionary `elements`.

3. **`mov`**: This is a dictionary that maps command strings to movement vectors. For example, `mov` might look like this:
   ```python
   mov = {
       'up': (0, -1),
       'down': (0, 1),
       'left': (-1, 0),
       'right': (1, 0)
   }
   ```

4. **`nxt`**: This is a tuple representing the new position after applying the movement vector from `mov` to `pos`.
   - `nxt` is calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.

5. **`allPlayers`**: This is a dictionary where `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`.

6. **`team`**: This is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`, which determines the team that scored a goal based on the current position `pos`.

7. **`time`**: This is a variable representing the current time.

8. **`GoalName`**: This is a dictionary that maps team identifiers to goal names. For example:
   ```python
   GoalName = {
       'team1': 'Team 1',
       'team2': 'Team 2'
   }
   ```

Given these definitions, the `print` statement is:
```python
print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine `team`**:
   - `team` is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`.
   - Without the exact implementation of `goalIn`, we can only say that `team` will be one of the keys in the `GoalName` dictionary.

2. **Determine `GoalName[team]`**:
   - `GoalName[team]` will be the corresponding value in the `GoalName` dictionary for the key `team`.

3. **Determine `time`**:
   - `time` is a variable representing the current time. Its exact value is not provided in the initial state, so we will represent it as `time`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the current time followed by the goal name of the team that scored a goal.

Output: **%d %s GOAL (where %d is the value of `time` and %s is the goal name of the team that scored a goal, as determined by `GoalName[team]`)**
