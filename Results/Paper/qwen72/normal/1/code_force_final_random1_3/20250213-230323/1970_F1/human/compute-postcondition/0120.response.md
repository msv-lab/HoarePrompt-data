Output State: **`n` is a specific integer read from the input, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)` and an entry for each string `s` in any `line` that is not '..' with the value `(i, index_of_s)`, `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in any `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists. For each string `s` in any `line` that is not '..' and has a second character 'G', the tuple `(i, index_of_s)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `s` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, and the length of `command` is not equal to 3, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the coordinate pair `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is the new position calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates the next position `nxt` based on the current position `pos` and the movement command `com`.
- `mov` is assumed to be a predefined dictionary mapping movement commands to their respective changes in coordinates.
- The new position `nxt` is calculated by adding the corresponding values from `mov[com]` to the current position `pos`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
