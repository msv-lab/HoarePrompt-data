Postcondition: ***`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element, and `el` is the third element. If `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. If `el` is '.S', `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is set to 0, and `points[team]` is incremented by 10. If `len(command) != 3`, `obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string, `pos` is the value associated with `obj` in the dictionary `elements`, and `nxt` is a tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B', `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. Otherwise, the values of `command`, `obj`, `com`, `pos`, and `nxt` remain unchanged.***
