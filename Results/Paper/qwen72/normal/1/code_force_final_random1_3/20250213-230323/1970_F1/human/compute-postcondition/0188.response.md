Postcondition: ***`obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `pos` is the value associated with `obj` in the dictionary `elements`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is a player, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
