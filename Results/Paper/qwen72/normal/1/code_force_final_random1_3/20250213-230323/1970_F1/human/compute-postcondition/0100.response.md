Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing three elements: the original list `line`, the new list `line`, and the new list `line` again, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)` and an entry for each string `s` in the new `line` that is not '..' with the value `(1, index_of_s)`. If `line[2]` is not '..', `elements` includes an additional entry for `line[2]` with the value `(2, 2)`. `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a new list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input and must have at least three elements, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in the new `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`. If `line[2]` represents a player, `allPlayers` now includes an additional entry for `line[2]` with the value `False`. If `line[2][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if `line[2][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` has a new element `(2, 2)` appended to it. If `line[2]` is '..', none of these additional changes occur.***
