Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `pos` is the value associated with `obj` in the dictionary `elements`, `nxt` is a tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `player` is determined based on the condition `isPlayer(obj)`.
- If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, then `player` is set to `obj`.
- Otherwise, `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.
- All other variables (`command`, `obj`, `com`, `pos`, `nxt`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values.
