Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value provided by the user, `x` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to all zeros, `i` is equal to `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the list `a` to a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
