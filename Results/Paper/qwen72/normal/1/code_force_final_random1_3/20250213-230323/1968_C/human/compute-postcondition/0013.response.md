To determine what will be printed by the `print(*a)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the list `a`:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `x` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `a` is a list of length `n` where:
     - The first element `a[0]` is 1000.
     - Each subsequent element `a[i]` (for \(1 \leq i < n\)) is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`.

2. **Construction of List `a`:**
   - `a[0] = 1000`
   - For \(1 \leq i < n\):
     - `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`

3. **Loop Variable `i`:**
   - The loop variable `i` is equal to `n-1`.

Given this information, the list `a` will be constructed as follows:
- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 1000 + x[0]`
- `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = (1000 + x[0]) + x[1]`
- ...
- `a[n-1] = a[n-2] + x[n-2]`

When the `print(*a)` statement is executed, it will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Example Calculation:
Suppose `n = 4` and `x = [10, 20, 30]`:
- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = 1000 + 10 = 1010`
- `a[2] = 1010 + 20 = 1030`
- `a[3] = 1030 + 30 = 1060`

The list `a` would be `[1000, 1010, 1030, 1060]`.

### General Output:
The output will be the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces. The elements of `a` are constructed as described above.

Output: **1000 1000 + x[0] 1000 + x[0] + x[1] ... 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]**
