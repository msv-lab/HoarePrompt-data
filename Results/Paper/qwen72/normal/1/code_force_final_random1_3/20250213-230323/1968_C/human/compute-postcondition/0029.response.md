The code snippet `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `x` is a new list of integers provided by the user
- `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is 1000 plus the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`. All other elements of `a` (if any) are 0
- `i` is `n-1`

After executing the code snippet:
- `x` is now a list of integers provided by the user
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is 1000 plus the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`. All other elements of `a` (if any) are 0, and `i` is `n-1`.**
