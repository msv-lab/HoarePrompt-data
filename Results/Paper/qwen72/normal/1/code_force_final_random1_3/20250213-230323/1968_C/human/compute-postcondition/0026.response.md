To determine what will be printed by the `print(*a)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the list `a` step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is the integer value provided by the user.
   - `x` is a new list of integers provided by the user.
   - `a` is a list of length `n` where:
     - `a[0]` is 1000.
     - For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is 1000 plus the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`.
   - All other elements of `a` (if any) are 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.

2. **Construction of List `a`:**
   - The first element `a[0]` is always 1000.
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where \(1 \leq i < n\)), the value is calculated as 1000 plus the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `n = 4` and `x = [1, 2, 3]`.
   - `a[0] = 1000`
   - `a[1] = 1000 + x[0] = 1000 + 1 = 1001`
   - `a[2] = 1000 + (x[0] + x[1]) = 1000 + (1 + 2) = 1003`
   - `a[3] = 1000 + (x[0] + x[1] + x[2]) = 1000 + (1 + 2 + 3) = 1006`

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.
   - Given the example above, the output would be: `1000 1001 1003 1006`.

Therefore, the final output will be:
Output: **1000 1001 1003 1006 (where the values are determined by the initial state and the construction of the list `a`)**

Note: The exact values will depend on the specific values of `n` and `x` provided by the user. The general form of the output will be a sequence of integers starting with 1000 and each subsequent value being 1000 plus the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `x`.
