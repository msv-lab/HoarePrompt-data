You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, representing the number of elements in the array a. The array x contains n-1 integers x_2, ..., x_n, where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [0] * n
        
        a[0] = 1000
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        
        print(*a)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a list of `n-1` integers provided by the user, and `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is the sum of `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`. The loop has completed all `t` iterations, and the final state of `a` for each test case is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves an array `x` of `n-1` integers. It returns a result for each test case based on the elements of the array `x`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
