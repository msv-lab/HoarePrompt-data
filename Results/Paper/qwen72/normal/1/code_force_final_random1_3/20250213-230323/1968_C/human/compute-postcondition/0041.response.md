The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the context given, it appears that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving an array of integers. The function is expected to process each test case according to the specified constraints.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, representing the number of elements in the array `a`.
- The array `x` contains `n-1` integers `x_2, ..., x_n`, where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.

Given this information, the function likely processes each test case and returns a result based on the input array `x`.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves an array `x` of `n-1` integers. It returns a result for each test case based on the elements of the array `x`.**
