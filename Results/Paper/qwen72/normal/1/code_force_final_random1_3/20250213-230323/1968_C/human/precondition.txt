t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, representing the number of elements in the array a. The array x contains n-1 integers x_2, ..., x_n such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, representing the remainders when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}.
