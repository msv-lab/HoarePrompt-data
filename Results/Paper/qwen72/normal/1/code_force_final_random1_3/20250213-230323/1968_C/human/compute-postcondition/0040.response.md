Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a list of `n-1` integers provided by the user, and `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is the sum of `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`. The loop has completed all `t` iterations, and the final state of `a` for each test case is printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the program has processed `t` different test cases. For each test case, the array `a` has been constructed such that its first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element from the list `x`. The final state of `a` for each test case is printed, and the loop has completed all its iterations.
