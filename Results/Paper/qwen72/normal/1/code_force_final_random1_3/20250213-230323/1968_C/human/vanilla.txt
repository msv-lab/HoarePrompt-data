- The construction of `a` ensures that `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i-1]` for all `2 \le i \le n`.
  - The initial value of `a[0]` being 1000 is a safe choice because it is greater than any possible value of `x[i]`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly constructs the array `a` such that the conditions are satisfied for all test cases.

Correctness:
