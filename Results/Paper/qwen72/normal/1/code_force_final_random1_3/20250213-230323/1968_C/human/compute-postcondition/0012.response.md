Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for 1 ≤ i < n) is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`. The loop variable `i` is equal to `n-1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `t` remains within the specified range.
- The value of `n` is still greater than 0, indicating the length of the list `a`.
- The list `x` remains unchanged as it was provided by the user.
- The list `a` now contains `n` elements, where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.
- The loop variable `i` has reached the value `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `a` that was updated by the loop.
