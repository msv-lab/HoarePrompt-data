The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop iterates a number of times equal to the integer value provided by the input function. Since the loop does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, or `a` directly, these values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. However, the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop counter `_` would have reached the value of `int(input()) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the loop counter `_` needs to be incremented by 1, but since it's a `for` loop, this increment is handled automatically by the loop itself. Therefore, the state of the loop counter `_` is not explicitly stated in the state description.

Given that the loop is about to start another iteration, the state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, except that the loop counter `_` is implicitly incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value provided by the user, `x` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is 1000 plus the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`. All other elements of `a` (if any) are 0, and `i` is `n-1`.**
