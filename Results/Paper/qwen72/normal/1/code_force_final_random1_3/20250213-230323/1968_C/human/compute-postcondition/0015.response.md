The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for 1 ≤ i < n) is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`. The loop variable `i` is equal to `n-1`.**
