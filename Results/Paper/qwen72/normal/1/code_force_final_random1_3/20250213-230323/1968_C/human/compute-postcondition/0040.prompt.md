Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, representing the number of elements in the array a. The array x contains n-1 integers x_2, ..., x_n, where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] * n
    a[0] = 1000
    for i in range(1, n):
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for 1 ≤ i < n) is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`. The loop variable `i` is equal to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value provided by the user, `x` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is 1000 plus the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`. All other elements of `a` (if any) are 0, and `i` is `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is the sum of `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`, and `i` is `n-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
