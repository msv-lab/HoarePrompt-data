The value of `a` is calculated as the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\). Given that `sm` is `(2 + suf[n])` and its current value is less than 0, the absolute value of `sm` is taken, and then it is divided by \(10^9 + 7\).

Since `sm` is less than 0, `abs(sm)` will be a positive value. The division by \(10^9 + 7\) will yield an integer value because of the floor division (`//`).

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `sm`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `sm` is `(2 + suf[n])` and is less than 0, `a` is `abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)`**.
