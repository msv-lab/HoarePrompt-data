Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b`, `i` is `n`, if `sm` < 0, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) + (abs(2 + suf[n]) // 10 + 1) * 10`, otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % 10, `j` is `j + 1`, `t` must be greater than `j + 1`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores them in the list `l`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `sm`, `j`, `t`, `b`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The new variable `l` is now a list of integers derived from the input.
