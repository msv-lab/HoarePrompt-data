The code appends the element at index `i + 1` from the list `suf` to the list `smin`. This means the new last element of `smin` is now the same as the element at index `i + 1` in `suf`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, the element at index `i + 1` in the list `suf` is less than the element at index `i` in the list `smin`, and the list `smin` has a new last element which is the element at index `i + 1` in the list `suf`.**
