The code appends the value `suf[i] + l[i]` to the list `suf`. Given that `i` is 1, the new element added to `suf` is `suf[1] + l[1]`. The initial state specifies that `suf` already includes an additional element which is `suf[0] + l[0]`. Therefore, after executing the code, `suf` will have one more element appended to it, making the second element `suf[1] + l[1]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `suf` now includes two additional elements: `suf[0] + l[0]` and `suf[1] + l[1]`.**
