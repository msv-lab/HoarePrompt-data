The code `smin.append(suf[i + 1])` appends the element at index `i + 1` of the list `suf` to the list `smin`. Given the initial state, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `smin` has been updated according to the conditions described in the task.

- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- The new element `suf[i + 1]` is appended to the list `smin`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `smin` now includes the element `suf[i + 1]` appended to its previous contents.**
