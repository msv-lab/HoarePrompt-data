Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `b` is a list of strings from the new input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the new `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the new `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the new input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent elements are the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `i` is 0, `smin` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `suf[1]`, `sm` is initially `2 + suf[n]` and is updated based on certain conditions, and the current value of `suf[i + 1]` is less than the current value of `smin[i]`.**
