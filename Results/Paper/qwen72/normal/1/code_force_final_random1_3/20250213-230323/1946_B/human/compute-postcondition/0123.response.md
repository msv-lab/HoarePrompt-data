The code snippet `smin.append(smin[i])` appends the value of `smin[i]` to the list `smin`. This means that the new last element of `smin` is now `smin[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`.

After executing the code, the updated state is:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`.
- `smin` now has an additional element at the end, which is `smin[i]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`, `smin` has an additional element at the end, which is `smin[i]`.**
