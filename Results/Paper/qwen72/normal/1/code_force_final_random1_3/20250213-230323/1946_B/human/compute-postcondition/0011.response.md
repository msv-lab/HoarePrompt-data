The code snippet `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])` appends the sum of the `i`-th element of `suf` and the `i`-th element of `l` to the list `suf`. Given that `i` is 1, the second element of `suf` (which is `l[0]`) is added to the second element of `l` (which is `l[1]`), and the result is appended to `suf`.

Let's break it down:

- `suf` initially contains `[0, l[0]]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `l[i]` is `l[1]`.
- `suf[i]` is `l[0]`.
- The new element to append is `suf[i] + l[i]`, which is `l[0] + l[1]`.

After appending, `suf` will be `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1]]`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 1, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1]]`, `i` is 1**.
