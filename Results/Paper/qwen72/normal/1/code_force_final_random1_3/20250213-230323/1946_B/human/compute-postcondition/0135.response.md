Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains the same, `i` is `n - 1`, and `smin` has been updated such that for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin[i + 1]` is set to `suf[i + 1]`; otherwise, `smin[i + 1]` is set to `smin[i]`. The values of `b`, `k`, `j`, `t`, and `smin[0]` remain `[0]`. `sm` is now `-111`.**
