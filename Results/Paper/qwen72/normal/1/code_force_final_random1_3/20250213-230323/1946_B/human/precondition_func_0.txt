t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the array and the number of operations, respectively. The array a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n and k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
