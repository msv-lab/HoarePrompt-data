Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `sm` is `suf[i] - smin[i]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]`.
- The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
- The condition `if suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm == -111` is no longer relevant because `sm` is directly assigned the value `suf[i] - smin[i]`.
