Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of `l`, `i` is 0, and `smin` is a list containing two elements. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` contains the elements 0 and `suf[1]`. Otherwise, `smin` contains two elements, both of which are 0, and `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`.***
