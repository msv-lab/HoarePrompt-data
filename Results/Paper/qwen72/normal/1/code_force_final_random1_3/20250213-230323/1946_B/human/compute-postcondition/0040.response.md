Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of `l`, `i` is 2, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements. The elements of `smin` are such that for each index `i` (from 0 to `n`), `smin[i]` is the minimum value of `suf[j]` for all `j` from 1 to `i + 1`. `sm` is now `suf[2] - smin[2]`.**
