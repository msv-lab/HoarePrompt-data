Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 2, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], suf[2] + l[2]]`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]` to the list `suf`. Since `i` is 2, `suf[2]` is `l[0] + l[1]`, and `l[2]` is the third element in the list `l`. Therefore, the new element appended to `suf` is `(l[0] + l[1]) + l[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
