The code snippet `smin.append(suf[i + 1])` appends the element at index `i + 1` from the list `suf` to the list `smin`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `i + 1`
- If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, the list `smin` has a new last element which is the element at index `i + 1` in the list `suf`.
- Otherwise, if `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`, the list `smin` has an additional element at the end, which is `smin[i]`.

The code `smin.append(suf[i + 1])` always appends the element at index `i + 1` from `suf` to `smin`, regardless of the comparison condition.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `i + 1`
- The list `smin` has a new last element which is the element at index `i + 1` in the list `suf`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, the list `smin` has a new last element which is the element at index `i + 1` in the list `suf`.**
