The provided Python code snippet reads input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns this list to the variable `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `sm`, `suf`, `j`, or `t`, but it introduces a new variable `b` which holds the split input.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0
- `i` is `n`
- If `sm` < 0, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) + (abs(2 + suf[n]) // 10 + 1) * 10`, otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % 10`
- `j` is `j + 1`
- `t` must be greater than `j + 1`

After executing the code:
- `b` is assigned the list of strings resulting from splitting the input.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, if `sm` < 0, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) + (abs(2 + suf[n]) // 10 + 1) * 10`, otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % 10`, `j` is `j + 1`, `t` is greater than `j + 1`, `b` is a list of strings from the input.**
