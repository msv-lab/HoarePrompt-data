Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `sm` is `suf[i] - smin[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]`.
- The initial condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 0 remains unchanged.
- The initial condition that `i` is 0 remains unchanged.
- The condition that either `suf[i] - smin[i]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is equal to -111 is no longer relevant because `sm` is now explicitly set to `suf[i] - smin[i]`.
