Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `smin` is updated. If `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`, `smin` now includes the element `suf[i + 1]` appended to it. Otherwise, `smin` has one more element, which is the value of `smin[i]` at the current index `i`.***
