To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `j` is 0
- `b` is a list of strings from the input
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be equal to the length of the list `l`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`
- `l` is a list of integers from the input
- `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of `l`
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `smin` is a list containing one element which is 0

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0 (the starting point of the range).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of `l`, `i` is 0, `smin` is a list containing one element which is 0**
