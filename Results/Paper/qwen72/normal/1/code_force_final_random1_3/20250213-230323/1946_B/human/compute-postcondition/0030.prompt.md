Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be equal to the length of the list `l`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of `l`, `i` is `n - 1`, `smin` is a list containing one element which is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if suf[i + 1] < smin[i]:
        smin.append(suf[i + 1])
    else:
        smin.append(smin[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of `l`, `i` is 0, and `smin` is a list containing two elements. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` contains the elements 0 and `suf[1]`. Otherwise, `smin` contains two elements, both of which are 0, and `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of `l`, `i` is 1, and `smin` is a list containing three elements. If `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`, then `smin` contains the elements 0, `suf[1]`, and `suf[2]`. Otherwise, `smin` contains the elements 0, 0, and 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of `l`, `i` is 2, and `smin` is a list containing four elements. If `suf[3] < smin[2]`, then `smin` contains the elements 0, `suf[1]`, `suf[2]`, and `suf[3]`. Otherwise, `smin` contains the elements 0, 0, 0, and 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
