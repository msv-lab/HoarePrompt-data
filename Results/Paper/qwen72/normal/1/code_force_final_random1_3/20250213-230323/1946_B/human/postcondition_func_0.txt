The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case includes an integer `n` (the length of an array), an integer `k` (the number of operations), and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function computes a specific value based on the array and the number of operations, then prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function processes all test cases and prints the results one by one. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.
