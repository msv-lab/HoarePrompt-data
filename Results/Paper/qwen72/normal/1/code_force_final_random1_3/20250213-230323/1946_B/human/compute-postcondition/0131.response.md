The code snippet `smin.append(suf[i + 1])` appends the element at index `i + 1` of the list `suf` to the list `smin`.

- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `smin` is updated by appending the element `suf[i + 1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `smin` now includes the element `suf[i + 1]` appended to it.**
