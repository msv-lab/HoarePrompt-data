Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `b` is a list of strings from the new input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the new `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the new `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the new input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent elements are the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `i` is `n - 1`, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum cumulative sum up to that index in `suf`, and `sm` is -111.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm == -111:
        sm = suf[i] - smin[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0. If `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm == -111`, then `sm` is updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]`. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1. If `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm == -111`, then `sm` is updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]`. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2. If `suf[2] - smin[2] > sm` or `sm == -111`, then `sm` is updated to `suf[2] - smin[2]`. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
