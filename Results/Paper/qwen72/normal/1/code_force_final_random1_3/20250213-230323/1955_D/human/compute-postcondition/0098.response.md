The code `b_values = set(b)` creates a set named `b_values` containing the unique elements from the list `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `m`, or `cnt_b`.

Output State: **`i` is `m-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to `m`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`.**
