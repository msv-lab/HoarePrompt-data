The value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1. Since `i` is 0, the value of `a[0]` is used to index into `cnt_b`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `cnt_b[a[0]]` is decremented by 1, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is in `b_values`.**
