The code snippet `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the value of the element in the dictionary `cnt_b` at the key `b[i]` by 1. Given the initial state where `m` must be greater than 0 and `i` starts at 0, the specific changes and the resulting state are as follows:

- The value of `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The value of `m` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1.**
