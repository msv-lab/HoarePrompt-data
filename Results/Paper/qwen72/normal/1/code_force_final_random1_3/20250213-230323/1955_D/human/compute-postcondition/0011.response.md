The code snippet `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the value at the index `b[i]` in the list `cnt_b` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so the value at `b[2]` is used to determine the index in `cnt_b` that gets incremented.

Here's the detailed step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `_` is a placeholder for iterating over a range determined by a positive integer input.
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 (values are taken from input).
   - `b` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `max_val` is 1000000.
   - `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 initialized with all elements set to 0 except `cnt_b[b[0]]` which is now 1 and `cnt_b[b[1]]` which is now 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `m` must be greater than 2.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the value at the index `b[2]` in the list `cnt_b` by 1.
   - Since `i` is 2, the value at `b[2]` is used to determine the index in `cnt_b`.

3. **Impact**:
   - The value at `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

4. **Updated State**:
   - `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1.
   - The rest of the initial state remains the same.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `_` is a placeholder for iterating over a range determined by a positive integer input, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 (values are taken from input), `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 initialized with all elements set to 0 except `cnt_b[b[0]]` which is now 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` which is now 1, and `cnt_b[b[2]]` which is now 1, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2.**
