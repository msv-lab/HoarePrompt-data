Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 1, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `curr` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
