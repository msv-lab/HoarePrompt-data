Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to its original value, `i` is `m-1`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `curr` is initialized to 0.
- All other variables (`m`, `i`, `cnt_b[b[j]]`, `b_values`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
