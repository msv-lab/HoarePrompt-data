### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` initializes a list `cnt_b` to keep track of the frequency of elements in `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Counting Elements in `b`:**
   - The function iterates over the elements of `b` and increments their counts in `cnt_b`.
   - It also creates a set `b_values` to quickly check if an element from `a` is in `b`.

3. **Initial Window Check:**
   - The function initializes `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the number of matching elements in the current window of size `m`.
   - It iterates over the first `m` elements of `a` and checks if they are in `b_values`. If so, it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is non-negative.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The function uses a sliding window approach to check all subarrays of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window (`a[i + m]`), it checks if it is in `b_values`. If so, it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is non-negative.
   - For each element removed from the window (`a[i]`), it checks if it is in `b_values`. If so, it increments the count in `cnt_b` and decrements `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is positive.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

5. **Resetting Counts:**
   - After processing each test case, the function resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to 0 to prepare for the next test case.

### Validation Using Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the function correctly initializes and processes each test case.
- The initial window check and sliding window approach are validated by the annotations, showing that the function correctly updates the counts and the current number of matching elements.
- The resetting of counts ensures that each test case is processed independently.

### Conclusion:
- The function correctly handles the initialization and input reading.
- It correctly counts the elements in `b` and uses a set for quick lookups.
- The initial window check and sliding window approach are implemented correctly to count the number of good subarrays.
- The function resets the counts for each test case, ensuring that the state is clean for the next test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final: **True**
