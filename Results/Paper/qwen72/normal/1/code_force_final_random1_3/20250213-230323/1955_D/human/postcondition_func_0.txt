The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it counts the number of contiguous subarrays of length `m` in `a` that contain at least `k` elements present in `b` and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the results for each test case. The internal state of the function, including variables like `cnt_b`, `b_values`, `ans`, and `curr`, is reset or updated appropriately for each new test case.
