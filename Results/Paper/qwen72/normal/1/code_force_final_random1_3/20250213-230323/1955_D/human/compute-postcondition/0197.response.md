Output State: **`m` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `curr` is 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `curr` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1.
- The value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` was previously incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1` where `b[j]` matches `a[i]`.
- If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.
- If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 after the decrement, `curr` is set to 1.
- If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, or if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is less than 0 after the decrement, `curr` remains 0.
- All other variables (`m`, `i`, `b_values`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
