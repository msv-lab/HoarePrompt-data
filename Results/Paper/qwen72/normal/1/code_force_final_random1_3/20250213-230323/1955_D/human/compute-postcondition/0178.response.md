The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `m` must still be greater than `i` (so `m` must be greater than 2).

State: **`m` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1**
