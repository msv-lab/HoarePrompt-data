The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` decrements the count of the element `a[i + m]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. Given the initial state, we know that `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and thus `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is a positive integer before the decrement.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **`cnt_b[a[i + m]]`**: This value is decremented by 1.
2. **Other Variables**: The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `b_values`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
3. **`curr`**: Since the code snippet does not affect `curr` directly, its value remains unchanged unless `cnt_b[a[i]]` was previously greater than 0 and this decrement causes it to become 0 or less, which would then affect `curr`. However, the given code snippet does not provide enough context to determine if `curr` is affected, so we assume it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1.**
