Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than or equal to 0 before the decrement, `curr` is set to 2. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was less than 0 before the decrement, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `ans` remains 0. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1, otherwise `ans` remains 0. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `curr` remain unchanged, and `ans` remains 0.***
