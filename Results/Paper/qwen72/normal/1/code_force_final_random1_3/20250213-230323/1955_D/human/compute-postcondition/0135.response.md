Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. The current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
