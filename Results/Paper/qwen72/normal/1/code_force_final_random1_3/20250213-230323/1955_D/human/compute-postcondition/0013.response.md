Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `_` is a placeholder for iterating over a range determined by a positive integer input, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 (values are taken from input), `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 initialized with all elements set to 0 except for the elements at indices corresponding to the values in `b[:m]`, each of which is incremented by 1, `i` is `m-1`, `m` is the same as the input value for `m`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- The placeholder `_` remains unchanged.
- The integer `t` remains within its specified range.
- The integers `n`, `m`, and `k` remain within their specified ranges.
- The list `b` remains unchanged.
- The integer `max_val` remains 1000000.
- The list `cnt_b` has been updated such that for each element in the list `b` up to index `m-1`, the corresponding index in `cnt_b` has been incremented by 1.
- The loop variable `i` has reached the value `m-1`.
- The integer `m` remains the same as it was initially provided.
