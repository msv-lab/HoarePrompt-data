The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` decrements the value at the index `a[i + m]` in the list `cnt_b` by 1. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001, initially set to 0 except for the elements at indices corresponding to the values in `b[:m]`, each of which is incremented by 1.
- `a[i + m]` is an element in the list `a` at the position `i + m`, and it is known to be in the set `b_values`.
- The value at the index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is decremented by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `i` is 0.
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ n.
- `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`.
- `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 initialized with all elements set to 0 except for the elements at indices corresponding to the values in `b[:m]`, each of which is incremented by 1.
- `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`.

After executing the code:
- The value at the index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is decremented by 1.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `i` is 0.
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ n.
- `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`.
- `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001, with the value at the index `a[i + m]` decremented by 1.
- `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `max_val`, `ans`, `curr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 with the value at the index `a[i + m]` decremented by 1, `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than `m`, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ m, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `ans` is 0, and `curr` is the number of elements in `a[:m]` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative.**
