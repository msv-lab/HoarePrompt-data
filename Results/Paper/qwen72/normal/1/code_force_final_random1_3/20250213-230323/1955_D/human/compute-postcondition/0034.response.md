Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `_` is a placeholder for iterating over a range determined by a positive integer input, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 (values are taken from input), `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 initialized with all elements set to 0 except for the elements at indices corresponding to the values in `b[:m]`, each of which is incremented by 1, `i` is `m-1`, `m` is the same as the input value for `m`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is the number of elements in `a[:m]` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `m` times, decrementing the count of elements in `cnt_b` for each element in `a[:m]` that is also in `b_values`.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `m-1` because the loop index starts at 0 and increments up to `m-1`.
- The variable `curr` will hold the count of elements in `a[:m]` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after the loop completes.
