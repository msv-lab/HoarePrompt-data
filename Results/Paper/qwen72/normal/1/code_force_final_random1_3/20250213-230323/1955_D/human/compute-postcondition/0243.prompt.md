Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`m` is greater than or equal to its original value, `i` is `m-1`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, and `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
            curr -= 1
    if a[i + m] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
            curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`m` is greater than or equal to its original value, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2, `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is one more than its original value, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is one less than its updated value. If `curr` is less than `k`, `ans` remains 0, and `cnt_b`, `curr` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`m` is greater than or equal to its original value, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than `m`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is two less than its original value. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 3. If `curr` is less than `k`, `ans` remains unchanged. `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is one more than its original value. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is not greater than 0, `ans`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, `ans`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` remain unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, `ans`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`m` is greater than or equal to its original value, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, and `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, `cnt_b`, `curr`, and `ans` remain unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[2 + m]]` is decremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, `cnt_b`, `curr`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
