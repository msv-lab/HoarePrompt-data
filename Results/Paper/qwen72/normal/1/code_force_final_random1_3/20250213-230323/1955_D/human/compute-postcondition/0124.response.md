Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `a[i]` is in `b_values`, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`. Given that `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` was previously decremented by 1.
- The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1, effectively reversing the previous decrement.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
