Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `m` is a positive integer, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` and `ans` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The condition `n` is greater than `m + 2` remains unchanged.
- The value of `m` remains a positive integer.
- The set `b_values` containing the unique elements from the list `b` remains unchanged.
- The line `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1.
- The values of `curr` and `ans` remain unchanged because the given code snippet only affects `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`.
