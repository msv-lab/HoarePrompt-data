You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is decremented by the number of test cases processed, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their last assigned values from the final test case, `a` and `b` retain their last assigned lists from the final test case, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the final `b`, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 with all elements in `b_values` set to 0, `ans` is the total number of valid subarrays found across all test cases, `curr` is the number of elements in the final sliding window of size `m` that are in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it counts the number of contiguous subarrays of length `m` in `a` that contain at least `k` elements present in `b` and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the results for each test case. The internal state of the function, including variables like `cnt_b`, `b_values`, `ans`, and `curr`, is reset or updated appropriately for each new test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It processes multiple test cases, counts the occurrences of elements from `b` in the sliding window of `a`, and checks if the current window can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements from `b`. The program resets the count for each test case and handles the sliding window efficiently. After reviewing the logic and considering various edge cases, the program seems to handle all potential scenarios correctly.
