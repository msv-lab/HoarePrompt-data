Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decremented by 1, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `curr` is incremented by 1, so `curr` is now 1.
- All other variables (`i`, `m`, `cnt_b[a[1]]`, `b_values`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
