Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all piles have the same number of stones correctly. According to the problem description, if all piles have the same number of stones, Alice can win by choosing \( k \) equal to the number of stones in each pile, which will empty all piles in one move. However, the current implementation of the program does not correctly identify this scenario.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
5 5 5
```
The expected output is "Alice" because Alice can choose \( k = 5 \) and win in one move. However, the program will incorrectly output "Bob" because it does not correctly handle the case where all piles have the same number of stones.
