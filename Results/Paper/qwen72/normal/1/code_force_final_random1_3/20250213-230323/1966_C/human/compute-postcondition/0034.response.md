Output State: **`tc` is an input integer where 0 < tc ≤ 10^4 - 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `dp` is `True`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `dp = True` sets the variable `dp` to `True`.
- All other variables (`tc`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial condition for `dp` (whether any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is greater than 1) is overridden by the assignment `dp = True`.
- Therefore, the final state includes all the initial conditions except for the updated value of `dp`.
