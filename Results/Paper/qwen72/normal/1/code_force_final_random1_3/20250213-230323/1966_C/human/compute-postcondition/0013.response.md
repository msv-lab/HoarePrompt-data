To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the `print` statement:

### Initial State:
- `tc` is an input integer where \(1 \leq tc \leq 10^4\).
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `dp` is `True` if any consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is 0) differ by more than 1, otherwise `dp` is `False`.

### Analysis:
1. **List `arr`**: 
   - `arr` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, followed by 0.
   - For example, if the input integers are `[5, 3, 2, 1]`, then `arr` would be `[5, 3, 2, 1, 0]`.

2. **Variable `n`**:
   - `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - For the example above, `n` would be `4` because `arr` has 5 elements.

3. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - For the example above, `i` would be `3`.

4. **Variable `dp`**:
   - `dp` is `True` if any consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is 0) differ by more than 1.
   - For the example `arr = [5, 3, 2, 1, 0]`:
     - The differences between consecutive elements are:
       - \(5 - 3 = 2\) (greater than 1)
       - \(3 - 2 = 1\) (not greater than 1)
       - \(2 - 1 = 1\) (not greater than 1)
     - Since there is at least one pair of consecutive elements that differ by more than 1, `dp` is `True`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
```

- The `print` statement checks the value of `dp`.
- If `dp` is `True`, it prints 'Alice'.
- If `dp` is `False`, it prints 'Bob'.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the logic described, `dp` will be `True` if any consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is 0) differ by more than 1. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Alice**
