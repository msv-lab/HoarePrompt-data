The value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or the negation of the current value of `dp`. Given that `i` is 2, the new value of `dp` will be `True` if `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1` or if the current value of `dp` is `False`. If both conditions are `False`, `dp` remains `False`.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `arr` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, followed by 0.
- `i` is 2, so we are checking the difference between `arr[2]` and `arr[3]`.
- If `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1`, then `dp` becomes `True`.
- If `arr[2] - arr[3] <= 1` and the current value of `dp` is `True`, `dp` remains `True`.
- If `arr[2] - arr[3] <= 1` and the current value of `dp` is `False`, `dp` becomes `True`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `dp` is `True`**.
