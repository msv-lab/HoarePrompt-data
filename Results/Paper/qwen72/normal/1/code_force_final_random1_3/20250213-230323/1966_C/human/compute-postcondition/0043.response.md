Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `tc` is an input integer where \(0 < \text{tc} \leq 10^4 - 2\).
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq \text{t} \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, where `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `dp` is the result of the expression `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or ... or arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not True`.

### Analysis:
1. **List `arr`**:
   - `arr` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, followed by 0.
   - For example, if the input integers are `[5, 3, 1]`, then `arr` would be `[5, 3, 1, 0]`.

2. **Variable `n`**:
   - `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - If `arr = [5, 3, 1, 0]`, then `n = len(arr) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`.

3. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - If `n = 3`, then `i = 3 - 1 = 2`.

4. **Expression for `dp`**:
   - The expression `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or ... or arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not True` needs to be evaluated.
   - Since `not True` is always `False`, the expression simplifies to `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or ... or arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1`.

5. **Evaluating the Expression**:
   - We need to check if any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is greater than 1.
   - For example, if `arr = [5, 3, 1, 0]`:
     - `arr[1] - arr[2] = 5 - 3 = 2` (which is > 1)
     - `arr[2] - arr[3] = 3 - 1 = 2` (which is > 1)
     - `arr[3] - arr[4] = 1 - 0 = 1` (which is not > 1)
   - Since at least one difference is greater than 1, the expression `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or ... or arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1` evaluates to `True`.

6. **Final Output**:
   - The `print` statement will print `'Alice'` if `dp` is `True`, otherwise it will print `'Bob'`.
   - Since `dp` is `True`, the output will be `'Alice'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice**
