Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `tc` is an input integer where \(1 \leq tc \leq 10^4 - 1\).
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `dp` is `True` if any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is 0) is greater than 1, otherwise `dp` is `False`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `arr`**: 
   - `arr` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, followed by 0.
   - For example, if the input integers are `[5, 3, 2, 1]`, then `arr` would be `[5, 3, 2, 1, 0]`.

2. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is set to `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the list `arr` excluding the last element (which is 0).
   - If `arr` has 5 elements (including the 0), then `n = 4` and `i = 3`.

3. **Variable `dp`**:
   - `dp` is determined by checking if any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is 0) is greater than 1.
   - For example, in the list `[5, 3, 2, 1, 0]`, the differences are:
     - \(5 - 3 = 2\)
     - \(3 - 2 = 1\)
     - \(2 - 1 = 1\)
   - Since one of the differences (5 - 3) is greater than 1, `dp` will be `True`.

### Conclusion:
- If any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is 0) is greater than 1, `dp` will be `True`.
- Otherwise, `dp` will be `False`.

Given the condition in the `print` statement:
- If `dp` is `True`, it will print 'Alice'.
- If `dp` is `False`, it will print 'Bob'.

### Final Output:
Since the initial state specifies that `dp` is `True` if any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is 0) is greater than 1, and we have seen that this condition is met in the example, the output will be:

Output: **Alice**
