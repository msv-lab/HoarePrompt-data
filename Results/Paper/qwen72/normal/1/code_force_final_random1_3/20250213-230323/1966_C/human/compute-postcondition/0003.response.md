The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, removes duplicates by converting the list to a set, sorts the resulting unique integers in descending order, and appends a `0` to the end of the list. This list is then assigned to the variable `arr`.

- The initial state includes `tc`, `t`, `n`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
- The code only affects the creation of the `arr` list and does not modify `tc`, `t`, or `n`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0.**
