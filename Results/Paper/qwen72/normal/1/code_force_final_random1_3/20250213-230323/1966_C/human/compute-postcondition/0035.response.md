Output State: **`tc` is an input integer where 0 < tc ≤ 10^4 - 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `dp` is `True`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `len(arr) - 1`, which means `n` now holds the length of the list `arr` minus one.
- All other variables (`tc`, `t`, `arr`, `i`, `dp`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
