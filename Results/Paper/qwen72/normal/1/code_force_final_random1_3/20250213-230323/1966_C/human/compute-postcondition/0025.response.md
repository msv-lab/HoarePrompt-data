To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State:
- `tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0
- `i` is `n`
- `dp` is `True` if `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1`, otherwise `dp` is `False`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range 1 to `n-1`.

### Adjustments:
- Since `i` is currently `n`, it needs to be decremented by 1 to be within the valid range for the next iteration.
- The loop condition `i < n` must still hold true for the next iteration.

### Updated State:
- `i` should be `n - 1` for the next iteration.
- The other variables (`tc`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `dp`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

### Final State:
State: **`tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4 - 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `dp` is `True` if `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1`, otherwise `dp` is `False`**
