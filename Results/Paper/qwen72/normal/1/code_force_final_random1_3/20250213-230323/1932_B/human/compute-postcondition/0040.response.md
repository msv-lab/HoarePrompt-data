Output State: **`a` is an iterable with at least 2 elements, `current_year` is updated based on the last element of `a`, `ai` is the next element in `a`, `next_year` is `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `next_year` is calculated using the formula `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
- `current_year` is based on the last element of `a`.
- `ai` is the next element in `a`.
- The values of `a`, `current_year`, and `ai` remain unchanged, but `next_year` is now set to the result of the calculation.
