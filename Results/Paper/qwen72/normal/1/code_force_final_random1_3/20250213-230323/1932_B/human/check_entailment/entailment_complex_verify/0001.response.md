### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the year when the \(n\)-th sign occurs, given that each sign \(i\) occurs every \(a_i\) years and the signs must occur sequentially.

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program initializes the year to 0 for each test case.
   - For each sign \(a_i\), the program updates the year using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.
   - This expression works as follows:
     - `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`.
     - If `year % ai` is 0, it means the current year is already a multiple of \(a_i\), so we add \(a_i\) to the year.
     - If `year % ai` is not 0, it means the current year is not a multiple of \(a_i\), so we add the remainder to make it the next multiple of \(a_i\).

3. **Step-by-Step Verification:**
   - **Test Case 1:**
     - \(a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]\)
     - Year 0: First sign occurs at year 3.
     - Year 3: Second sign occurs at year 4.
     - Year 4: Third sign occurs at year 8.
     - Year 8: Fourth sign occurs at year 10.
     - Year 10: Fifth sign occurs at year 18.
     - Year 18: Sixth sign occurs at year 36.
     - Output: 36 (Correct)

   - **Test Case 2:**
     - \(a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\)
     - Year 0: First sign occurs at year 1.
     - Year 1: Second sign occurs at year 2.
     - Year 2: Third sign occurs at year 3.
     - Year 3: Fourth sign occurs at year 4.
     - Year 4: Fifth sign occurs at year 5.
     - Output: 5 (Correct)

   - **Test Case 3:**
     - \(a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\)
     - Year 0: First sign occurs at year 1.
     - Year 1: Second sign occurs at year 2.
     - Year 2: Third sign occurs at year 3.
     - Year 3: Fourth sign occurs at year 4.
     - Year 4: Fifth sign occurs at year 5.
     - Output: 5 (Correct)

   - **Test Case 4:**
     - \(a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]\)
     - Year 0: First sign occurs at year 50.
     - Year 50: Second sign occurs at year 60.
     - Year 60: Third sign occurs at year 711.
     - Year 711: Fourth sign occurs at year 800.
     - Year 800: Fifth sign occurs at year 1303.
     - Year 1303: Sixth sign occurs at year 2012.
     - Output: 2012 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the \(n\)-th sign occurs for each test case, following the rules of sequential occurrences. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
