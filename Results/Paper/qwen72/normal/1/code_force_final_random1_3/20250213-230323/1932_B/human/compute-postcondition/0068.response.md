Output State: **The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element corresponds to the final value of `current_year` for each test case in `test_cases`. Each `current_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in the list `a` for that test case, which is greater than or equal to the sum of the multiples of each element in `a` that were added to the initial `current_year` (which was 0). The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.**
