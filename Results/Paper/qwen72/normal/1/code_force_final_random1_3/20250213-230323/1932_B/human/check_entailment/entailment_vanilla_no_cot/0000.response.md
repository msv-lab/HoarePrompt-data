Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It processes each test case by iterating through the list of sign periodicities, `a`, and calculates the year in which the nth sign will occur, taking into account that each sign must occur strictly after the previous one. The logic used in the loop ensures that the year is incremented by the periodicity of the current sign if it hasn't already occurred in the current year (`year % ai or ai`). This approach correctly handles the sequential occurrence requirement and produces the expected output for the given examples.
