Postcondition: ***`current_year` is 0, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `results` now includes `current_year` as its last element, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and must be an iterable with at least one element, `test_cases`, `test`, and `results` remain unchanged except for the changes mentioned above, `ai` is the first element of `a`. If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, `next_year` is set to `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is set to the smallest multiple of `ai` greater than `current_year`.***
