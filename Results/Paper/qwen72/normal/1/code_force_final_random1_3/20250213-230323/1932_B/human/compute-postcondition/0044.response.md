Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `current_year` will be the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the sum of the multiples of each element in `a` that were added to the initial `current_year` (which was 0). The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `test`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged. `results` now includes `current_year` as its last element.**
