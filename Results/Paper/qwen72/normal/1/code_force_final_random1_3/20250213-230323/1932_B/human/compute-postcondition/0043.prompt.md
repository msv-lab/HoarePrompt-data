Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements that must have at least 2 elements, `test` is the second element in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `current_year`, `n` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases` and must be an iterable with at least 1 element, `current_year` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for ai in a:
    if current_year % ai == 0:
        next_year = current_year + ai
    else:
        next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
    current_year = next_year


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is an iterable with at least 1 element. If `current_year` was divisible by `ai` without any remainder, `current_year` is now set to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `current_year` is now set to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is an iterable with at least 1 element. If `current_year` was divisible by the last element of `a`, `current_year` is now `current_year + last_element_of_a`. Otherwise, `current_year` is now the smallest multiple of the last element of `a` that is greater than the original `current_year`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an iterable with at least 2 elements, `current_year` is equal to the value of `next_year` (which was calculated based on the conditions given), and `ai` is the next element in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
