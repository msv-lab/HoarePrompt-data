Output State: **`current_year` is now equal to the final value of `next_year` after all iterations of the loop, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `results` now includes the previous `current_year` as its last element and the current `current_year` as its new last element, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and must be an iterable with at least one element, `ai` is the last element of `a` that was processed. If the final `current_year` was divisible by `ai`, `next_year` was set to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` was set to the smallest multiple of `ai` greater than the final `current_year`. The state of `test_cases`, `test`, and `results` remains unchanged except for the changes mentioned above.**
