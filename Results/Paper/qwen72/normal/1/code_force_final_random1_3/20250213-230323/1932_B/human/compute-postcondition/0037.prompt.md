Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) provided by the user, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    year = 0
    for ai in a:
        year += year % ai or ai
    print(year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least `n` elements, `year` is the sum of `(year % ai or ai)` for each `ai` in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0 but less than its value at the start of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user that has been fully iterated over, `year` is the sum of the initial `year` (which was 0) and the result of `(year % ai or ai)` for each element `ai` in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0 but less than its value at the start of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `year` is the sum of each element in the list `a` plus the remainder of `year` divided by each element in the list `a` if it is non-zero.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
