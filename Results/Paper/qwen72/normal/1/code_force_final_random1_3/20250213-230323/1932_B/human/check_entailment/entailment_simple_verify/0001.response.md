### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the year when the \(n\)-th sign occurs, given that each sign \(i\) occurs every \(a_i\) years.
   - The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the \(i\)-th sign must occur before the \((i+1)\)-th sign can start occurring.

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - For each test case, we initialize the year to 0.
   - For each sign \(a_i\), we need to find the next year when the sign occurs, starting from the current year.
   - The expression `year += year % ai or ai` is intended to ensure that:
     - If `year % ai` is 0, it means the current year is already a multiple of \(a_i\), so we add \(a_i\) to the year.
     - If `year % ai` is not 0, it means the current year is not a multiple of \(a_i\), so we add the remainder to make it the next multiple of \(a_i\).

3. **Step-by-Step Verification:**
   - **Test Case 1:**
     - \(a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]\)
     - Year 0: First sign occurs at year 3.
     - Year 3: Second sign occurs at year 4.
     - Year 4: Third sign occurs at year 8.
     - Year 8: Fourth sign occurs at year 10.
     - Year 10: Fifth sign occurs at year 18.
     - Year 18: Sixth sign occurs at year 36.
     - Output: 36 (Correct)

   - **Test Case 2:**
     - \(a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\)
     - Year 0: First sign occurs at year 1.
     - Year 1: Second sign occurs at year 2.
     - Year 2: Third sign occurs at year 3.
     - Year 3: Fourth sign occurs at year 4.
     - Year 4: Fifth sign occurs at year 5.
     - Output: 5 (Correct)

   - **Test Case 3:**
     - \(a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\)
     - Year 0: First sign occurs at year 1.
     - Year 1: Second sign occurs at year 2.
     - Year 2: Third sign occurs at year 3.
     - Year 3: Fourth sign occurs at year 4.
     - Year 4: Fifth sign occurs at year 5.
     - Output: 5 (Correct)

   - **Test Case 4:**
     - \(a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]\)
     - Year 0: First sign occurs at year 50.
     - Year 50: Second sign occurs at year 60.
     - Year 60: Third sign occurs at year 711.
     - Year 711: Fourth sign occurs at year 800.
     - Year 800: Fifth sign occurs at year 1303.
     - Year 1303: Sixth sign occurs at year 2012.
     - Output: 2012 (Correct)

4. **Critical Analysis:**
   - The expression `year += year % ai or ai` is crucial. It correctly handles the case where the current year is already a multiple of \(a_i\) by adding \(a_i\) to the year. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the current year is not a multiple of \(a_i\). Instead of adding the remainder, it should add the difference between the next multiple of \(a_i\) and the current year.
   - The correct way to update the year would be `year += (ai - year % ai) % ai`.

5. **Revised Algorithm:**
   - For each sign \(a_i\), the correct update should be:
     ```python
     year += (ai - year % ai) % ai
     ```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly calculate the year in which the \(n\)-th sign occurs for each test case due to the incorrect handling of the year update. The expression `year += year % ai or ai` does not always produce the correct next year.

Correctness: **False**
