The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 but still remain greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (but less than its value at the start of the previous iteration), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least `n` elements, `year` is the sum of `(year % ai or ai)` for each `ai` in the list `a`.**
