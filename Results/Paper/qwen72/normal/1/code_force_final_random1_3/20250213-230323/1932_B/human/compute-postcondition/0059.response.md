Output State: **`current_year` is now equal to `next_year`, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `results` now includes the previous `current_year` as its last element, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and must be an iterable with at least one more element, `ai` is the next element of `a`. If `current_year % ai == 0`, then `next_year` is `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.**
