Postcondition: ***`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `1`. If `r` is 0, all variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is updated to the calculated value, `b` is updated to `A[l - 1]` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `l - r > 0`, `b` is further updated to `b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.***
