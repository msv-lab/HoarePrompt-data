To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
x = r - (l + 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables and Their Values:**
   - `r` and `l` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we assume they are already defined and have specific values.
   - `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
   - `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
   - `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
   - `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
   - `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `i` is `2`.
   - `a` is the value of `A[l]`.

2. **Calculate the New Value of `x`:**
   - The expression `x = r - (l + 2)` calculates the value of `x` based on the values of `r` and `l`.
   - `x` is assigned the value of `r` minus the sum of `l` and 2.

3. **Update the Output State:**
   - The only variable that changes is `x`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State:
Output State: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `2`, `a` is the value of `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`.**
