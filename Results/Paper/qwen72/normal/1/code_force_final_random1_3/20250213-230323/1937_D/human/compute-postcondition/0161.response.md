To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

### Initial State:
- `s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `1`.
- `l` and `r` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `2`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `2`.
- `n` remains the same and must be greater than `2` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `2`.**
