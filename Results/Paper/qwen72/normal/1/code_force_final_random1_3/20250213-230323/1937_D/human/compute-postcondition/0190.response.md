To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `2`.
- `r` is one less than its original value if `r - l >= 0`.
- `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` if `r - l >= 0`.
- `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` if `r - l >= 0`.
- `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `l` and `r`:**
   - `l` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the calculations for `a` and `b`. We need to assume `l` is a valid index for the arrays `A` and `B`.
   - `r` is one less than its original value if `r - l >= 0`.

2. **Calculate `a`:**
   - `a = A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` if `r - l >= 0`.
   - Here, `A[l - 1]` is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to index `l - 1`.
   - `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` adjusts this count by the position and the number of previous '>' characters.

3. **Calculate `b`:**
   - `b = B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` if `r - l >= 0`.
   - `B[r]` is the cumulative count of '<' characters from the end up to index `r`.
   - `B[r - l]` is the cumulative count of '<' characters from the end up to index `r - l`.
   - `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` adjusts this count by the position and the number of previous '<' characters.
   - `b` is then updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.

4. **Compute the final expression:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')`.
   - Substitute the values of `a`, `b`, and `i` into the expression.

### Final Output:
Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for `l` and `r`, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables and their relationships.

Output: **(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1) (where a is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, b is B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l, and i is 2)**

This output provides a precise description of what will be printed based on the given initial state and the computation steps.
