Output State: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `0`, `l` is `0`, `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`, `a` is `A[0]`, the character at position `i` in `s` is '>', `l` is less than `r`, `x` is `r - 2`, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`**.

Explanation:
- The code `b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` updates the value of `b`.
- `idx_B[r - 1]` is the index of the last '<' character in the string `s`.
- `i` is 0, which is the current position in the string.
- `l` is 0, which is the count of '>' characters encountered so far.
- Therefore, `b` is calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - 0) * (0 + 1)`, which simplifies to `idx_B[r - 1]`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
