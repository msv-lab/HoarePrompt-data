Postcondition: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `2`. If `l < r`, and `x` >= 0, `b` is set to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `l < r` and `x` < 0, `b` remains equal to `B[r - 1]`. If `l >= r` and `r` is 0, no additional changes are made. If `l >= r` and `r` is not 0, `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * r`, and `b` is set to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**
