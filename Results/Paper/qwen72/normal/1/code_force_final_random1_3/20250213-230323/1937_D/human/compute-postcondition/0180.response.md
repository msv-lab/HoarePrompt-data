The code snippet provided increments the value of `l` by 1. This operation affects the value of `l` but does not change the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Here is the detailed output state:

Output State: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `2`, `l` is `l + 1`, `r` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged.**

This means that the only change is that the variable `l` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their original values and conditions.
