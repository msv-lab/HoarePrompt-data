The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function evaluates the string and returns the minimum number of swaps needed to make the string balanced. A string is considered balanced if every '<' character has a corresponding '>' character that follows it, and vice versa.
