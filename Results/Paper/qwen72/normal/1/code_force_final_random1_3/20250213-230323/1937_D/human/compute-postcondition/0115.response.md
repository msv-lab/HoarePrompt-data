To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `0`.
- `l` is `0`.
- `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1.
- `a` is `B[r]`.
- `l` is greater than `r`.
- `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
- The character at index `i` of `s` is '<'.
- `r` is not equal to 0.
- The difference between `l` and `r` is greater than 1. If the difference between `l` and `r` is not greater than 1, the values of `l`, `r`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

### Calculation:
1. **Determine `a`**:
   - `a` is `B[r]`, where `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1.
   - `B[r]` is the cumulative count of '<' characters from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.

2. **Determine `b`**:
   - `b` is calculated as:
     \[
     b = A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) \times (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) \times (r + 1)
     \]
   - `l` is greater than `r`.
   - `i` is `0`.

3. **Calculate the expression inside the `print` statement**:
   - The expression is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`.
   - Since `i` is `0`, the expression simplifies to `a * 2 + b * 2 + n`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the calculations, the `print` statement will output:
\[
a \times 2 + b \times 2 + n
\]

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` depend on the specific string `s`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + n (where a is B[r], b is the calculated value based on the formula, and n is the length of the string s)**
