The code snippet provided increments the value of `l` by 1. This operation only affects the variable `l`, while the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `0`.
- If `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[0]`, `x` is `r - 2`, and `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
- If `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and `r` is 0, there are no '<' characters in the string `s`.
- If `r` is greater than 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
- If `l - r > 0`, then `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

After executing the code snippet `l += 1`, the value of `l` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `0`, `l` is `l + 1`, if `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[0]`, `x` is `r - 2`, and `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and `r` is 0, there are no '<' characters in the string `s`. If `r` is greater than 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `l - r > 0`, then `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**
