Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `i` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is assigned the value `n - 1 - j`. Since `j` is 0, `i` becomes `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
