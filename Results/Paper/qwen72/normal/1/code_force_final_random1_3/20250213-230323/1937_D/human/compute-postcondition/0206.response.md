Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and processes it to calculate and print a series of integer values. These values are derived from the positions of '<' and '>' characters in the string and their relative distances. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the calculated values directly. After the function completes, the string `s` remains unchanged, and the printed output represents the result of the function's computation. **
