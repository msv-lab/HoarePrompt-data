Output State: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`. The list `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters. The list `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`. `B` is an empty list. `idx_B` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `idx_B` as an empty list. This does not affect any of the other variables or their values. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of `idx_B` being an empty list.
