The code assigns the value of `B[r - 1]` to the variable `b`. Given the initial conditions, `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`, and `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters. Since `r` is the total number of '<' characters, `B[r - 1]` corresponds to the cumulative count of '<' characters at the last '<' character's position.

Output State: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `0`, `l` is `0`, `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`, `a` is `A[0]`, the character at position `i` in `s` is '>', `l` is less than `r`, `x` is `r - 2`, and `b` is `B[r - 1]`.**
