Reasoning:  
The problem statement requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave a one-dimensional grid based on the direction indicated by the characters in the string. The provided program attempts to solve this by precomputing the movements and times for both directions ('<' and '>'), and then using these precomputed values to quickly answer each query.

However, the execution summary describes a different functionality: it mentions that the function `func_1` calculates the minimum number of swaps required to balance a string of '<' and '>' characters. This is not aligned with the problem statement, which is about simulating the movement of a pinball on a grid.

Given this discrepancy, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem described. The logic and the purpose of the code do not match the requirements of the problem, leading to an incorrect solution.

Correctness: **False**
