To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - If `s[1]` is '>', then `idx_A` is [0, 1] and `A` is [0, 1].
   - If `s[1]` is not '>', then `idx_A` and `A` remain empty lists.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
   ```

3. **Impact Analysis:**
   - We need to evaluate the expression `x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` based on the initial state.
   - The value of `x` depends on the values of `A` and `idx_A`.

4. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `s[1]` is '>'**
     - `idx_A` is [0, 1]
     - `A` is [0, 1]
     - `len(A) - 1` is 1
     - `A[len(A) - 1]` is `A[1]` which is 1
     - `len(idx_A) - 1` is 1
     - `idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]` is `idx_A[1]` which is 1
     - `i` is 2
     - `i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]` is `2 - 1` which is 1
     - `len(idx_A)` is 2
     - `(i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` is `1 * 2` which is 2
     - `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` which is `1 + 2` which is 3

   - **Case 2: `s[1]` is not '>'**
     - `idx_A` is []
     - `A` is []
     - `len(A) - 1` is -1 (which would cause an index error, but since `A` is empty, this case is invalid)

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `s[1]` is '>', the valid case is Case 1.
   - The value of `x` is 3.

6. **Output State:**
   - `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `idx_A` is [0, 1].
   - `A` is [0, 1].
   - `x` is 3.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `idx_A` is [0, 1], `A` is [0, 1], `x` is 3.**
