Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 3`, `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged, `x` remains unchanged. If `s[i]` is '<', `idx_B` now includes the value `n - 3`, `B` now includes the value `x` which is \( B_{\text{last}} + (idx_B_{\text{last}} - (n - 3)) \times len(idx_B) \), and `x` is \( B_{\text{last}} + (idx_B_{\text{last}} - (n - 3)) \times len(idx_B) \).***
