Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining how long it takes for a pinball to leave a one-dimensional grid, given the initial configuration of the grid represented by a string of '<' and '>' characters. The program processes each test case by calling the `func_1` function, which computes the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

### Key Points:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for computing the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.
   - It uses two lists, `A` and `B`, to store cumulative counts of '>' and '<' characters, respectively, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous occurrences.
   - The function iterates through the string twice: once from left to right to handle '>' characters and once from right to left to handle '<' characters.
   - The final loop computes the time for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell by combining the information from `A` and `B`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case, with each result corresponding to the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.

### Potential Issues:
- The function `func_1` is quite complex and involves multiple nested loops and conditions. However, the logic appears to be consistent with the problem statement and the expected behavior.
- The program does not explicitly handle edge cases, but the problem statement guarantees valid inputs, so this is not a concern.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The use of cumulative counts and the adjustment of positions and counts in the lists `A` and `B` are appropriate for the problem at hand. The program should produce the correct output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
