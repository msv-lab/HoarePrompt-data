To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and its impact on the variables:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - If the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', then `idx_A` is a list containing [0].
   - If `len(idx_A) == 0`, then `A` is a list containing [0].
   - Otherwise, `A` is a list containing one element `[x]`, where `x` is calculated as `(0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   ```python
   x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - **Check the character at index `i` of `s`**:
     - Since `i` is 1, we check `s[1]`.
     - If `s[1]` is '>', then `idx_A` is [0].
     - If `s[1]` is not '>', then `idx_A` remains an empty list.

   - **Determine the value of `A`**:
     - If `s[1]` is '>', then `idx_A` is [0], and `A` is calculated as:
       - `x` = (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A) = (0 - 0) * 1 = 0.
       - Therefore, `A` is [0].
     - If `s[1]` is not '>', then `idx_A` is an empty list, and `A` is also an empty list.

   - **Calculate the new value of `x`**:
     - If `s[1]` is '>', then `A` is [0] and `idx_A` is [0]:
       - `x` = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
       - `x` = 0 + (1 - 0) * 1 = 1.
     - If `s[1]` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` are both empty lists, and the calculation of `x` will raise an error because `A` and `idx_A` are empty.

4. **Output State**:
   - If `s[1]` is '>', then:
     - `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
     - `n` must be greater than 1.
     - `i` is 1.
     - `idx_A` is [0].
     - `A` is [0].
     - `x` is 1.
   - If `s[1]` is not '>', then:
     - `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
     - `n` must be greater than 1.
     - `i` is 1.
     - `idx_A` is an empty list.
     - `A` is an empty list.
     - The calculation of `x` will raise an error.

Output State: **If `s[1]` is '>', then `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `idx_A` is [0], `A` is [0], and `x` is 1. If `s[1]` is not '>', then `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `idx_A` is an empty list, `A` is an empty list, and the calculation of `x` will raise an error.**
