Output State: **The only variable that changes is `x`. All other variables remain unchanged. If `x` >= 0, `b` is now equal to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. Otherwise, `b` remains equal to `B[r - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` updates the value of `b` to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
- According to the initial state, if `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` should be updated to `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. However, the code snippet provided overrides this condition and sets `b` to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
- If `x` is less than 0, `b` was initially set to `B[r - 1]`, but the code snippet provided also overrides this and sets `b` to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
- Therefore, regardless of the value of `x`, `b` is now equal to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
