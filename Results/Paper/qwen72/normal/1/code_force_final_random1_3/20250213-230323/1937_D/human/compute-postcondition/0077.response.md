The code snippet assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to the variable `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `0`.
- `l` is `0`.
- `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`.
- `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
- `l` is greater than or equal to `r`.
- `r` is greater than 0.

Since `l` is greater than or equal to `r` and `r` is greater than 0, `l - 1` is a valid index in the list `A`. Therefore, `b` is assigned the value of `A[l - 1]`.

Output State: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `0`, `l` is `0`, `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is greater than 0, `b` is `A[l - 1]`.**
