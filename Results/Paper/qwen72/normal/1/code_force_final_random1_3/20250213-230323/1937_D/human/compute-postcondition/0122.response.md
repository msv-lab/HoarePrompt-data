Output State: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `1`, `a` is the value of `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `B[r - 1]` to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged. The new state includes the updated value of `b` and retains all other initial conditions.
