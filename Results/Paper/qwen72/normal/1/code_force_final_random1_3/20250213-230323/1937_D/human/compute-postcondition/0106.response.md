Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `0`.
- `l` is `0`.
- `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1.
- The character at index `i` of `s` is '<'.
- `l` is greater than `r`.
- `r` is equal to 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `i` is `0`.
   - `l` is `0`.
   - `r` is `0` (since `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1, and it is given that `r` is equal to 0).
   - `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `n - i`: Since `i` is `0`, this simplifies to `n`.
   - `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`: Since `l` is `0`, `l - 1` is `-1`. This means `idx_A[l - 1]` is out of bounds because `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters, and there is no valid index at `-1`. However, since `l` is `0` and `l` is greater than `r`, it implies that there are no '>' characters in the string `s` (otherwise, `l` would be greater than 0).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since there are no '>' characters in the string `s`, `idx_A` is an empty list, and `idx_A[l - 1]` is undefined. However, the problem states that `l` is greater than `r` and `r` is 0, which implies that `l` is 0, and thus the expression `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` is not valid. But for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that the term `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` evaluates to 0 because there are no '>' characters.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` simplifies to `n + 0`, which is just `n`.

### Output:
Output: **n (where n is the length of the string s)**
