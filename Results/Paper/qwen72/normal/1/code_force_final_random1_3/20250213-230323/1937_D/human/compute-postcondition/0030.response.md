To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

- `j` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `n-1`.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`, and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` is an empty list.
- `idx_B` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` should start at 0.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list**
