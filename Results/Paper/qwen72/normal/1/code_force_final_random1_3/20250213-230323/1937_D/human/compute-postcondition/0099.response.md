Output State: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `0`, `l` is `0`, `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is updated to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`, the character at index `i` of `s` is '<', and the difference between `r` and `l` is non-negative (i.e., `r - l >= 0`).**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
