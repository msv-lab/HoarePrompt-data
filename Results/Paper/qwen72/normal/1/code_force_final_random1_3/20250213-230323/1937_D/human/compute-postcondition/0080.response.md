The given code snippet updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from its current value. Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `b` is initially `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`.
   - `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
   - `l` is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - `r` is greater than 0.
   - `l - r` is greater than 0.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` calculates the difference between the indices of the `l-1`-th and `l-r-1`-th '>' characters in `s`, multiplied by the difference `l - r`.
   - This value is then subtracted from the current value of `b`.

3. **Updated Value of `b`**:
   - The new value of `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - The values of `s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `j`, `i`, `l`, `r`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `0`, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is greater than 0, `b` is now `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `l - r` is greater than 0.**
