Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `-1`, `l` is `0`, `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if l < r:
            a = A[l]
            x = r - (l + 2)
            b = B[r - 1]
            if x >= 0:
                b = b - B[x]
                b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
            b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 1]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1
        if l <= r:
            if l == 0:
                print(i + 1, end=' ')
            else:
                a = A[l - 1]
                a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l
                b = B[r]
                if r - l >= 0:
                    b = b - B[r - l]
                    b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)
                b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l
                print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r]
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r - 1 > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 2]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `0`. If `s[i]` is '>', `l` is incremented by 1. If `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[0]`, `x` is `r - 2`, and `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and `r` is 0, there are no '<' characters in the string `s`. If `r` is greater than 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `l - r > 0`, then `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `s[i]` is '<', `r` is decremented by 1. If `l` is 0, the state remains unchanged. If `l` is greater than 0, `a` is updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `r` is 0, then `l` is greater than `r`. If `r` is not 0, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, and `l` is greater than `r`. If the difference between `l` and `r` is not greater than 1, the values of `l`, `r`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `1`. If `s[i] == '>'`, `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `l` is 0, `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is not 0, `a` is set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is set to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `r` is 0, `r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is set to `B[r]`, and `b` is set to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`. If `l - r - 1 <= 0`, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `2`. If `s[i] == '>'`, `l` is incremented by 1, and `r` remains unchanged. If `s[i] != '>'`, `r` is decremented by 1. If `l <= r` and `l` is 0, no additional changes are made. If `l` is not 0 and `r - l >= 0`, `a` is updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is updated to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, `a` is set to `B[r]`, and `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`, and `b` is further updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. If `l - r - 1 <= 0`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
