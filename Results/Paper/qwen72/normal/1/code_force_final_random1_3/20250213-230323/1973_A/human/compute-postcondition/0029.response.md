Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(p1, p2, p3)` is the second tuple in the list, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3` of the second tuple, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2` of the second tuple, `resultats` is a list containing the value -1 if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, otherwise `resultats` contains the value `egalites // 2` appended to its existing values, and `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. The value `egalites // 2` is appended to `resultats`.**
