Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(p1, p2, p3)` is the second tuple in the list, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3` of the second tuple, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2` of the second tuple, if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing the value -1, and the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `egalites` is less than 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `egalites` is greater than or equal to 0, and `resultats` contains the value `egalites // 2` appended to its existing values.**
