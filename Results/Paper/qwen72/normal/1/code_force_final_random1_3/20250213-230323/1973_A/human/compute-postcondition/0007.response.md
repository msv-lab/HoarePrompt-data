Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(p1, p2, p3)` is the first tuple in the list, `resultats` is a list that may contain one element which is -1 if `total_points` is odd, otherwise `resultats` remains an empty list, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`.** 

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `total_matchs` by performing integer division of `total_points` by 2. The values of `t`, `cas_de_test`, `resultats`, and `total_points` remain unchanged. The new variable `total_matchs` is introduced and set to the integer division of `total_points` by 2.
