Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` remains a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. The list `cas_de_test` remains unchanged and contains `t` tuples, each with three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30). The list `resultats` will contain `t` elements, where each element corresponds to the result of processing one tuple from `cas_de_test`. For each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)`, if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are odd, or if the total matches (`total_points // 2`) is greater than 3, or if `p3` is greater than the total matches, or if the number of ties (`egalites`) is negative, then `-1` is appended to `resultats`. Otherwise, the number of ties (`egalites // 2`) is appended to `resultats`.**
