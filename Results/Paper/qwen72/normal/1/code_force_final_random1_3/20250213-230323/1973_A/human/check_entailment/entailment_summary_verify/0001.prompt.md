You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list `cas_de_test` containing `t` tuples, each with three integers (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of three players in a game. The function processes each tuple to determine the number of ties or if the game is invalid. It returns a list `resultats` of length `t`, where each element is either the number of ties divided by 2 or -1. Specifically, for each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)`, if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are odd, or if the total matches (`total_points // 2`) is greater than 3, or if `p3` is greater than the total matches, or if the number of ties (`egalites`) is negative, then `-1` is appended to `resultats`. Otherwise, the number of ties (`egalites // 2`) is appended. The original list `cas_de_test` remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the final scores of three players.
   - The scores are given as \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
   - Each game can either end in a win/loss (2 points for the winner, 0 for the loser) or a draw (1 point for each player).

2. **Total Points Calculation:**
   - The total points scored by all players must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (win/loss) or 2 points (draw).
   - If the total points are odd, it's impossible to achieve the scores, so we return -1.

3. **Total Matches Calculation:**
   - The total number of matches played is half the total points because each match contributes 2 points.
   - If the total number of matches exceeds 3 (since there are only 3 players and each pair can play multiple times), or if the highest score \( p_3 \) is greater than the total number of matches, it's impossible to achieve the scores, so we return -1.

4. **Calculating Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the number of draws is derived from the fact that each draw contributes 2 points to the total points.
   - The number of draws is calculated as \( \text{total\_points} - 2 \times (p3 - p2) - 2 \times (p3 - p1) \).
   - This formula accounts for the points contributed by wins and losses, and the remaining points should be due to draws.
   - If the number of draws is negative, it means the scores are not achievable, so we return -1.

5. **Checking the Code:**
   - The code correctly checks if the total points are even.
   - It calculates the total number of matches and checks if it's feasible.
   - It calculates the number of draws using the derived formula and ensures it's non-negative.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or returns -1 if the scores are not achievable. Therefore, the program is correct.
