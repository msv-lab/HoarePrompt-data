The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cas_de_test`. 

- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (with the constraint 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30), representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order.

The function returns a list `resultats` containing `t` elements. Each element in `resultats` corresponds to a tuple in `cas_de_test` and is determined as follows:

- If the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are odd, or if the total matches (`total_points // 2`) is greater than 3, or if `p3` is greater than the total matches, or if the number of ties (`egalites`) is negative, the function appends `-1` to `resultats`.
- Otherwise, the function appends the number of ties (`egalites // 2`) to `resultats`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cas_de_test`, each containing three integers representing player scores. It returns a list `resultats` of length `t`, where each element is either the number of ties divided by 2 or -1, based on specific conditions related to the total points and the number of ties.**
