### Reasoning:

1. **Total Points Check**: 
   - The function correctly checks if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are odd. If they are, it appends `-1` to the results because the total points must be even for the game to be valid (since each game contributes 2 points in total).

2. **Total Matches Check**:
   - The function calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs = total_points // 2`). This is correct because each match contributes 2 points.
   - The function then checks if `total_matchs > 3` or `p3 > total_matchs`. This check is necessary because:
     - The maximum number of matches that can be played among three players is 3 (each pair playing once).
     - If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than the total number of matches, it means the scores are not achievable.

3. **Number of Draws Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the number of draws (`egalites`) using the formula: `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula is derived from the fact that the difference in points between the highest scorer and the others should be accounted for by wins, and the remaining points should be due to draws.
   - If `egalites` is negative, it appends `-1` to the results because a negative number of draws is not possible.
   - Otherwise, it appends `egalites // 2` to the results, which is the number of draws.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when no games are played (`0 0 0`), or when the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games (`1 1 10`).

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns a list of results, which is consistent with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or if the scores are invalid. The reasoning and checks used in the function are sound and cover all the necessary conditions.

Correctness: **True**
