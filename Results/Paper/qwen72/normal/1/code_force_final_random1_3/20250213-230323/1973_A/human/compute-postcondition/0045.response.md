Output State: **The program returns a list `resultats` containing `t` elements, where each element is either the number of ties (`egalites // 2`) or `-1` based on the conditions specified for each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in the list `cas_de_test`. Each tuple's result is determined by checking if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are odd, if the total matches (`total_points // 2`) is greater than 3, if `p3` is greater than the total matches, or if the number of ties (`egalites`) is negative. If any of these conditions are true, `-1` is appended; otherwise, the number of ties (`egalites // 2`) is appended.**
