The only objects in the loop head are the tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` and the list `cas_de_test`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cas_de_test` list. If the list has at least one tuple, the loop will execute. For the loop to execute, `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, and `(p1, p2, p3)` should be the first tuple in the list.

State: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(p1, p2, p3)` is the first tuple in the list, `resultats` is an empty list**
