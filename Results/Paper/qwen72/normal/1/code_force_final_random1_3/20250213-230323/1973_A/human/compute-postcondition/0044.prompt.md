Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. `resultats` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for p1, p2, p3 in cas_de_test:
    total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
    if total_points % 2 != 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    total_matchs = total_points // 2
    if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
    if egalites < 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
    else:
        resultats.append(egalites // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(p1, p2, p3)` is the first tuple in the list, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing the value -1, and the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `egalites` is less than 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `egalites` is greater than or equal to 0, and `resultats` contains the value `egalites // 2` appended to its existing values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(p1, p2, p3)` is the second tuple in the list, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3` of the second tuple, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2` of the second tuple, `resultats` is a list containing the value -1 if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, otherwise `resultats` contains the value `egalites // 2` appended to its existing values, and `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` is less than 0, an additional -1 is appended to `resultats`. Otherwise, the value `egalites // 2` is appended to `resultats`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `(p1, p2, p3)` is the third tuple in the list, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3` of the third tuple, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2` of the third tuple, and `resultats` is a list. If `egalites` is less than 0, -1 is appended to `resultats`. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, -1 is appended to `resultats`. If `egalites` is non-negative, `egalites // 2` is appended to `resultats`. If `total_points` is odd, an additional -1 is appended to `resultats`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
