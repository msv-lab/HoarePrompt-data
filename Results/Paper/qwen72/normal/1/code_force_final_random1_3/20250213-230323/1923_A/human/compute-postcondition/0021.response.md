Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `_` is 2.
2. `t` is greater than 1.
3. `n` is an input integer.
4. `arr` is a string containing the new input with all spaces removed.
5. `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found.
6. `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found.
7. `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(z.count('0'))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`arr`**: This is a string with all spaces removed from the input.
2. **`x`**: This is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`. If '1' is not found, `x` is `-1`.
3. **`y`**: This is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of `arr`. If '1' is not found, `y` is `-1`.
4. **`z`**: This is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.

### Determining `z`:
- If `x` is `-1` (i.e., '1' is not found in `arr`), then `z` will be an empty string because the start index is invalid.
- If `y` is `-1` (i.e., '1' is not found in the reversed `arr`), then `n - y` will be `n + 1`, which is out of bounds for the string `arr`. In this case, `z` will also be an empty string.
- If both `x` and `y` are valid indices, `z` will be the substring from index `x` to `n - y`.

### Counting '0' in `z`:
- If `z` is an empty string, `z.count('0')` will be `0`.
- If `z` is a non-empty substring, `z.count('0')` will count the number of '0's in that substring.

### Final Output:
- If '1' is not found in `arr` (i.e., `x` or `y` is `-1`), `z` will be an empty string, and the output will be `0`.
- If '1' is found in `arr`, `z` will be a substring of `arr` from `x` to `n - y`, and the output will be the count of '0's in that substring.

### Conclusion:
Output: **0 (if '1' is not found in `arr`) or the count of '0's in the substring from index `x` to `n - y` (if '1' is found in `arr`)**.
