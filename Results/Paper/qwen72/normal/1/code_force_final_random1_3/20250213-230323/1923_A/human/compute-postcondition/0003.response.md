The code `arr = ''.join(input('').split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it by whitespace (removing all spaces), and then joins the resulting list back into a single string without spaces. This means `arr` will contain the input string with all spaces removed.

- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `_` remains 0.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `arr` is now a string containing the input with all spaces removed.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string containing the input with all spaces removed.**
