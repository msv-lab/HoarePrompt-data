### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array of cells `arr`.

2. **String Conversion**:
   - The array `arr` is converted to a string with no spaces using `''.join(input('').split())`. This ensures that the array is treated as a continuous string of '0's and '1's.

3. **Finding the First and Last Chip**:
   - `x = arr.find('1')`: This finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' (the first chip).
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`: This finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string, which corresponds to the last occurrence of '1' in the original string.

4. **Extracting the Substring**:
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]`: This extracts the substring from the first chip to the last chip, inclusive. This substring will contain all the chips and possibly some free cells in between.

5. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - `print(z.count('0'))`: This counts the number of '0's (free cells) in the extracted substring. This count represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **State Before Function Call**:
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), representing the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), representing the number of cells.
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing whether the cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1). At least one cell contains a chip in each test case.

- **State After Reading Input**:
  - `t` is read and validated.
  - For each test case:
    - `n` is read and validated.
    - `arr` is read and converted to a string with no spaces.
    - `x` is the index of the first '1' in `arr`.
    - `y` is the index of the first '1' in the reversed `arr`, which corresponds to the last '1' in the original `arr`.
    - `z` is the substring from the first '1' to the last '1'.
    - The number of '0's in `z` is printed.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness**:
  - The approach correctly identifies the first and last chip positions.
  - It then extracts the relevant substring containing all the chips and any free cells in between.
  - Counting the '0's in this substring gives the minimum number of moves required to form a single block of chips.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly solves the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
