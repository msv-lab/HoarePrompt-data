The code snippet `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` reverses the string `arr` and finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string. This updates the value of `y`.

- `y` was previously defined as the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found. After executing the code, `y` is now the actual index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of `arr`.

All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, and `z`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string containing the new input with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of the new `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.**
