Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string containing the new input with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of the new `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` updates the value of `y` to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of `arr`.
- The reversed string of `arr` is obtained using `arr[::-1]`.
- The `find` method returns the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string, or `-1` if '1' is not found.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `z`) remain unchanged.
