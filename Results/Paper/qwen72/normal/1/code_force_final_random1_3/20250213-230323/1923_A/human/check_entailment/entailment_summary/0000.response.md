Reasoning:  
The provided solution seems to correctly address the problem by focusing on the segment of the ribbon that contains all the chips. By finding the first and last positions of the chips (`x` and `y`), the solution effectively isolates the segment of interest. The count of zeros within this segment (`z.count('0')`) gives the number of free cells that need to be filled to form a contiguous block of chips. This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations is calculated correctly.

However, there are a few points to consider:
1. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles edge cases well, such as when all chips are already in a contiguous block or when there are no free cells between the chips.
2. **Input Handling**: The input handling is straightforward and matches the problem's constraints.
3. **Efficiency**: The solution is efficient enough for the given constraints (up to 50 cells per test case).

Given these considerations, the solution appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
