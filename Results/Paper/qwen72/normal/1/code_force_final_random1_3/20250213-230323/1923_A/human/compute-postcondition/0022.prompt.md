Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer input by the user, where 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, representing the number of cells. a is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing whether the cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1). At least one cell contains a chip in each test case.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input(''))
    arr = ''.join(input('').split())
    x = arr.find('1')
    y = arr[::-1].find('1')
    z = arr[x:n - y]
    print(z.count('0'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string containing the input with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string containing the new input with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of the new `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string containing the new input with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
