Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string containing the new input with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of the new `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string `arr`. If '1' is not found in `arr`, `x` is set to `-1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
