Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string containing the new input with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of the new `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input(''))` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer. All other variables (`_`, `t`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial state. The new value of `n` is now an input integer, and the rest of the variables retain their original descriptions.
