Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where there are no free cells between the chips but the chips are not contiguous. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 0 1 0 1
```

The expected output is `2`, as we need to move the chips to form a single block. However, the current implementation will output `1`, which is incorrect. The program only counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, but it does not account for the fact that the chips might not be contiguous and require multiple moves to form a single block.
