Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string containing the input with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.

Code:
```
arr = ''.join(input('').split())
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. The line `arr = ''.join(input('').split())` reads a new input from the user, removes all spaces from it, and assigns the resulting string to `arr`.
2. This operation changes the value of `arr`, but does not affect the other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `z`).

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `arr` is now a string containing the new input with all spaces removed
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found
- `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found
- `z` is the substring of the new `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string containing the new input with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of the new `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.**
