The function `func` reads a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1), representing cells that are either free (0) or contain a chip (1). For each test case, the function identifies the segment of the list that starts from the first cell containing a chip to the last cell containing a chip. It then counts the number of free cells (0s) within this segment and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
