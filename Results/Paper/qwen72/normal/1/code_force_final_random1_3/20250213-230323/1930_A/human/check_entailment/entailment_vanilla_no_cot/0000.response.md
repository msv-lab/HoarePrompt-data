Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem. It sorts the list of integers and then iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element starting from the first (smallest) element. This approach ensures that the minimum value of each pair is added to the score, which is optimal because the smallest elements are used first, maximizing the overall score. The solution handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.
