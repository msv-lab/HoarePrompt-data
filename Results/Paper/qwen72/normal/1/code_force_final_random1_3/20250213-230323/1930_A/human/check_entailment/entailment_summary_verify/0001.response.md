### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to maximize the score by repeatedly selecting two integers from a list, adding the minimum of the two to the score, and removing both integers. This process is repeated `n` times, where `2n` is the total number of integers.

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - To maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available integers together. This ensures that the minimum value added to the score is as large as possible.
   - Sorting the list of integers helps in achieving this because the smallest integers will be at the beginning of the sorted list.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - It sorts the list of integers.
   - It initializes the score to 0.
   - It iterates over the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adds it to the score. This is because the sorted list ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, and the minimum of each pair is the first element in each pair.
   - Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

4. **Function Summary:**
   - The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of every second element starting from the first element in the sorted list.
   - It then prints the calculated sum for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and no further state is maintained.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly sorts the list of integers.
   - It correctly iterates over the sorted list, taking every second element and adding it to the score.
   - This approach ensures that the minimum value of each pair is added to the score, which is the optimal way to maximize the score.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and will produce the maximum possible score for each test case.

Final: **True**
