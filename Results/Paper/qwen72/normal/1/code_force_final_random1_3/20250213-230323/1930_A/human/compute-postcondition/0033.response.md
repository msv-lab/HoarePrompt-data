The code snippet `score += l[i]` updates the value of `score` by adding the value of the element at index `i` in the list `l` to the current value of `score`. Given that `i` is 4, the fifth element of the list `l` (since indexing starts at 0) is added to `score`.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input
- `score` is equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `l`
- `i` is 4

After executing the code snippet:
- `score` is updated to be the sum of the first, third, and fifth elements of `l`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 2, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is equal to the sum of the first, third, and fifth elements of `l`, `i` is 4**
