Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is the sum of every second element starting from the first element in `l` (i.e., the sum of `l[0]`, `l[2]`, `l[4]`, ..., `l[2*n-2]`), `i` is 2 * n - 2.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the list `l` starting from 0 and incrementing by 2 each time.
- For each iteration, the value at the current index `i` is added to the `score`.
- After all iterations, `score` will be the sum of the elements at the even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2*n-2) of the list `l`.
- The variable `i` will end up being 2 * n - 2, which is the last index that was processed in the loop.
- The variables `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
