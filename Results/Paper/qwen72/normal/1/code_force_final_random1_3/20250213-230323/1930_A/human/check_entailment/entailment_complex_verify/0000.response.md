Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the input, sorts the list of integers, and calculates the score by summing the elements at even indices of the sorted list. This approach ensures that the minimum value of each pair is added to the score, which aligns with the problem's requirement to maximize the score. The logic of the program is sound and matches the optimal strategy described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.

Final: **True**
