Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why it works for every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, it sorts the list of integers. Sorting ensures that the smallest elements are considered first when calculating the score.
3. **Score Calculation**: The program iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the smaller element of each pair to the score. This is done by summing up the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), which are guaranteed to be the smaller elements in each pair due to the sorting.
4. **Output**: The calculated score is printed for each test case.

The logic of the program ensures that the maximum possible score is achieved by always selecting the smallest available element in each pair, which is optimal according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
