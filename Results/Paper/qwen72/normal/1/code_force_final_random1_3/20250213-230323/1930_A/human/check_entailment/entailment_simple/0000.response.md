Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is in line with the problem statement.

2. **Sorting the List**: For each test case, the program sorts the list of integers `l`. Sorting is crucial because the optimal strategy to maximize the score involves always picking the smallest available pair of numbers. By sorting, we ensure that the smallest numbers are paired together, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values of these pairs.

3. **Calculating the Score**: The program iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element starting from the first element (`l[i]` for `i` in `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`). This is correct because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements are at the beginning, and taking every second element ensures that we are summing up the minimum values of each pair.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated score for each test case, which is the sum of the selected elements.

Given this analysis, the program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
