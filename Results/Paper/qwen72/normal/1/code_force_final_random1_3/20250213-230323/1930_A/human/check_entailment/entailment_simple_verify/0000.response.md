Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the input, sorts the list of integers, and calculates the score by summing the elements at even indices, which are the minimum values of each pair due to the sorting. This approach ensures that the maximum score is achieved as per the problem requirements. The logic and implementation align perfectly with the problem statement, and the program will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Final: **True**
