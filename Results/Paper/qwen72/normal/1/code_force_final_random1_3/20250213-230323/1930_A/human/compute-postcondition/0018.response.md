The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `2 * n`. The loop increments `i` by 2 each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and the loop has `n` iterations remaining. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 2, and `n` must still allow for the remaining iterations.

Since the loop has `n` iterations remaining, and `i` starts at 0, the next value of `i` should be 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `2 * n`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is now equal to the first element of `l`, `i` is 2, and the loop has `n - 1` iterations remaining.**
