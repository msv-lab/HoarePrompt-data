The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the described parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should accept the following parameters:

- An integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard.

The function's output is not clearly specified in the problem statement, but typically, such a function would process each test case and return a result for each one. Given the context, it is reasonable to infer that the function processes the list of integers for each test case and returns some form of result, possibly related to the manipulation or analysis of these integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
