The value of `score` is updated by adding the value of the element at index `i` (which is 4) in the list `l`. The initial value of `score` was the sum of the first and third elements of `l`. After the execution of the code, `score` is now the sum of the first, third, and fifth elements of `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 2, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `score` is now equal to the sum of the first, third, and fifth elements of `l`, `i` is 4**
