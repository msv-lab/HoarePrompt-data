Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the solution works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and a list of 2n integers.
3. **Sorting the List**: The list of integers is sorted. This is crucial because the optimal strategy to maximize the score is to always pair the smallest available number with the next smallest available number. By sorting the list, we ensure that the smallest numbers are paired first.
4. **Calculating the Score**: The program iterates over the sorted list, taking every second element starting from the first element (i.e., `l[0]`, `l[2]`, `l[4]`, etc.). This corresponds to selecting the minimum value in each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list.
5. **Outputting the Result**: The sum of these selected elements is printed as the score for the current test case.

This approach ensures that the score is maximized because the smallest elements are always chosen first, which aligns with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of the minimum values of the pairs.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.
