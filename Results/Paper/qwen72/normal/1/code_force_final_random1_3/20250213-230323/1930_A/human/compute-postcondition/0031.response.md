The code snippet `score += l[i]` updates the value of `score` by adding the value of the third element in the list `l` (since `i` is 2, and list indices start at 0). The initial value of `score` is the first element of `l`. After executing this code, the value of `score` is now the sum of the first and third elements of `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `l`, `i` is 2**.
