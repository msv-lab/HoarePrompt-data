The code snippet `score += l[i]` updates the value of `score` by adding the first element of the list `l` to it. Given that `i` is 0, the first element of `l` (which is a sorted list of integers) is added to `score`. Since `score` was initially 0, the new value of `score` is now equal to the first element of `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is equal to the first element of `l`, `i` is 0**.
