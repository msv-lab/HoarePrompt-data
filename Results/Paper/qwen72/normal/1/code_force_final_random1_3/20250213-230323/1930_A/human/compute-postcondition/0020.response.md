The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the parameters of the `range` function (`0`, `2 * n`, `2`). We need to adjust these to reflect the state at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 2.
- The loop has `n - 1` iterations remaining.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 2 (as per the step value in the `range` function). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be 4.
- The loop will still have `n - 1` iterations remaining, but since `i` has been incremented, the number of iterations remaining will now be `n - 2`.

Since the loop condition is `i < 2 * n`, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is now equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `l`, `i` is 4, and the loop has `n - 2` iterations remaining.**
