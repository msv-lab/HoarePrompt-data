Functionality: ** The function `func_2` processes a tree structure defined by a number of vertices `n` and a list of adjacency lists `u2vs`. It reads the number of vertices `n` and constructs the adjacency list representation of the tree by reading pairs of connected vertices. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from node 0 to find the shortest paths to all other nodes. Using the results of the BFS, it identifies two specific nodes (`a` and `b`) and traces the path between them. Depending on whether the length of this path is odd or even, it generates a list of operations (`ops`) that involve specific nodes along the path. Finally, it prints the number of operations and the operations themselves in a specific format and returns `None`. **
