The code `ops.append((c, i))` appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Here, `c` is the element at the middle index of `path_ba`, and `i` is 0.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `ops` was initially an empty list. After executing the code, `ops` now contains one element, which is the tuple `(c, i)`.
- `c` is the element at the middle index of `path_ba`. Since `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` and must be at least 0, `c` is the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`.
- `i` is 0, and it remains unchanged.
- All other variables (`n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ci`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, 0)`, `n` is the last non-negative value in the `previous` list that leads back to node 0, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to the original `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` followed by the sequence of node indices leading back to node 0, including the final value of `n`, `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` and must be at least 0, `c` is the element at the middle index of `path_ba`, `i` is 0.**
