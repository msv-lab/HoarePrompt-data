The function `func_2` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided context, it seems that the function should accept two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `u2vs`, which is a list of lists where each sublist represents the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree. The function returns `None`.
