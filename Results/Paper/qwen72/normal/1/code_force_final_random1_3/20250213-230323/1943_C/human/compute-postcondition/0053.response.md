The code snippet `ops.append((c, i))` adds a new tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, the tuple being added is `(c, 2)`, since `i` is 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, and `(c, 2)`, `n` is the last non-negative value in the `previous` list that leads back to node 0, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to the original `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` followed by the sequence of node indices leading back to node 0, including the final value of `n`, `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` and must be at least 1, `c` is the element at the middle index of `path_ba`, `i` is 2.**
