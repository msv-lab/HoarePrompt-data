The code `u2vs[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list located at index `v` in the list `u2vs`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to `n`
- The list at index `u` now contains the value `v` (which is the second integer provided as input minus 1)
- `u` is decreased by 1
- `v` is the second integer provided as input minus 1

After executing the code:
- The list at index `v` in `u2vs` now includes the value `u` appended to it.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to `n`
- The list at index `u` now contains the value `v` (which is the second integer provided as input minus 1)
- The list at index `v` in `u2vs` now includes the value `u` appended to it
- `u` is decreased by 1
- `v` is the second integer provided as input minus 1

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to `n`, the list at index `u` now contains the value `v` (which is the second integer provided as input minus 1), the list at index `v` in `u2vs` now includes the value `u` appended to it, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is the second integer provided as input minus 1.**
