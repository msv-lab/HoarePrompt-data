Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` remains the same as the initial input integer, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to `n`. Each sublist in `u2vs` contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index. The connections are bidirectional. The variable `d` now holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes as calculated by the `bfs` function. The variable `a` is assigned the result of the function `func_1(d)`.**
