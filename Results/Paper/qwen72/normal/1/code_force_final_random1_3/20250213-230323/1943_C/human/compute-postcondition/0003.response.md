The code snippet `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`.

- `u` and `v` are now assigned the values of the two integers provided as input.
- The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 1 and `u2vs` is a list of empty lists with a length equal to `n`. These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of empty lists with length equal to `n`, `u` and `v` are assigned the values of the two integers provided as input.**
