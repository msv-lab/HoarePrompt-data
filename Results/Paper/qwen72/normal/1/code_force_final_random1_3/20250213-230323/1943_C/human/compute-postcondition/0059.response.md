Output State: **`ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c1, 1)`, `n` is the last non-negative value in the `previous` list that leads back to node 0, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to the original `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` followed by the sequence of node indices leading back to node 0, including the final value of `n` and must have at least 2 elements, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` (an integer), `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is 1.** 

Explanation: The code appends the tuple `(c1, 1)` to the list `ops`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `c1` is derived from `c2`, which is half the length of `path_ba`. The value of `i` remains 1.
