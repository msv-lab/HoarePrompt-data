Output State: **`ops` is an empty list, `n` is the last non-negative value in the `previous` list that leads back to node 0, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to the original `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` followed by the sequence of node indices leading back to node 0, including the final value of `n`, and `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` (an integer).**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `c2 = len(path_ba) // 2` calculates the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2 and assigns the result to `c2`.
- All other variables (`ops`, `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`, `path_ba`) remain unchanged.
- Since the length of `path_ba` is even, `c2` will be an integer representing half the length of `path_ba`.
