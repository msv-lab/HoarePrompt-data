Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the new input, `q` is 2, `i` is 2. If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i)` equals 0, then `ans` is set to the maximum of 1 and `x // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.***
