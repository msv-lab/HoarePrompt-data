Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the new input, `q` is 2, `i` is 1, and `ans` is 1. If `x % i == 0` and `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `(x - n * (x // i))` is divisible by `(x // i)`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the original `ans` (which was 1) and `x // i`. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `x`, `n`, `q`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.***
