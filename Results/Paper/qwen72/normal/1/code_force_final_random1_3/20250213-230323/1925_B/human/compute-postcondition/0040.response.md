To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the conditions:

### Given Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `x` is at least 1
- `n` is the second integer from the new input
- `q` is 1
- `i` is 1
- `ans` is 1

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Value of `i`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
4. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: Increment `i` by 1 to 2.
- **`x`**: Ensure that `x` remains at least 1, as it is part of the loop condition.

### Final State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `x` is at least 1
- `n` is the second integer from the new input
- `q` is 1
- `i` is 2
- `ans` is 1

### Conclusion:
The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be incremented to 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the new input, `q` is 1, `i` is 2, and `ans` is 1**
