Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the new input, `q` is 1, `i` is 1, and `ans` is 1. If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i)` equals 0, then `ans` is updated to `max(1, x)`. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `x`, `n`, `q`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.***
