The only objects in the loop head are the variable `q` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute as long as `q` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`.

At the end of the last iteration, `q` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `q` must be less than the value returned by `int(input())`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `n` is the second integer from the new input, `q` is 2, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, and `ans` is the maximum value of `i` such that `x % i == 0` and `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, or the maximum value of `x // i` such that `x % i == 0` and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`. If no such `i` exists, `ans` remains 1.**
