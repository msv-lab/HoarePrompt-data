Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the new input, `q` is 2, `i` is 3, and `ans` is 1. If `x % 3 == 0` and `x - n * (x // 3) >= 0` and `x // 3 > 0` and `((x - n * (x // 3)) % (x // 3) == 0)`, then `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `x // 3`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.***
