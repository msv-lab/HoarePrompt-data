The code snippet `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `x` is at least 1
- `n` is the second integer from the new input
- `q` is 1
- `i` is 3
- `ans` is 1

Since `i` is 3 and `ans` is 1, the maximum of these two values is 3. Therefore, `ans` is updated to 3.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the new input, `q` is 1, `i` is 3, `ans` is 3.**
