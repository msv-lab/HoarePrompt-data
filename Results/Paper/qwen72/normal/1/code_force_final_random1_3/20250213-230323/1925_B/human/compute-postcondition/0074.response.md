The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `int(sqrt(x))`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `x` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must still be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the new input, `q` is 2, `i` is 3, and `ans` is 1.**
