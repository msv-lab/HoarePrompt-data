To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `i`: This is the loop variable that will iterate over the range.
   - `x`: This is the upper bound for the range, specifically `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

2. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1)` is not empty.
   - For the range to be non-empty, `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must be greater than 1.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` should start at 1.
   - `x` must be such that `int(sqrt(x)) + 1 > 1`, which simplifies to `int(sqrt(x)) >= 1`.
   - Since `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative number, `int(sqrt(x)) >= 1` implies that `x` must be at least 1.

### Conclusion:
- `i` should be 1.
- `x` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `q` is 0, `ans` is 1, and the input value must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**.
