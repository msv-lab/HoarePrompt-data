Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `q` is 0, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, and `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`, where `d` is a divisor of `x` and `d` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`. If no such divisor exists, `ans` remains 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
- For each `i`, if `x` is divisible by `i`, it checks two conditions:
  1. If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
  2. If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
- The final value of `ans` will be the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the conditions mentioned above. If no such divisor exists, `ans` remains 1.
