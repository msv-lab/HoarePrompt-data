To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `x` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 1.
- `n` is the second integer from the input.
- `q` is 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `i` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`.
- If `x` is divisible by `i` and `(x - n * (x // i))` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, then `ans` is the maximum value between 1 and `x // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `int(sqrt(x))` inclusive.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `q` is 0, `i` is 3, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `(x - n * (x // i))` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, then `ans` is the maximum value between 1 and `x // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.**
