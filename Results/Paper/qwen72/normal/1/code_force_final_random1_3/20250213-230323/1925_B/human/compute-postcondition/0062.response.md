Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the new input, `q` is 2, `i` is 1, and `ans` is 1. If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, then `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `x`, `n`, `q`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.***
