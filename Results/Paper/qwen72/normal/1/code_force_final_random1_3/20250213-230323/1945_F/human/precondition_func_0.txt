t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), the second line contains a list v of n integers (1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9), and the third line contains a permutation p of n integers (1 to n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
