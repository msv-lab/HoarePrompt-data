Output State: **s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of s is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5; unique_chars is a sorted list of unique characters from s; i is 0; j is len(unique_chars) - 1.**

Explanation: The variables `i` and `j` are initialized. `i` is set to 0, and `j` is set to the length of `unique_chars` minus 1. The other variables (`s` and `unique_chars`) remain unchanged.
