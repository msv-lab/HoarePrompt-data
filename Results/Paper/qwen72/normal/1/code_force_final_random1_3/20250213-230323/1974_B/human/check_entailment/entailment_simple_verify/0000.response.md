Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed does not correctly handle the decoding process. The main issue lies in the logic inside the `func_1` function, specifically in how it attempts to replace characters in the string `s` with their symmetric counterparts from the `unique_chars` list.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Unique Character Extraction and Sorting:**
   ```python
   unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
   ```
   This part correctly extracts and sorts the unique characters from the input string `s`.

2. **Character Replacement Logic:**
   ```python
   for char in s:
       if char in unique_chars:
           s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
           j -= 1
       else:
           unique_chars.insert(i, char)
           i += 1
           j += 1
   ```
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is in `unique_chars`, it replaces all occurrences of that character in `s` with the character at index `j` in `unique_chars`, and then decrements `j`.
   - If the character is not in `unique_chars`, it inserts the character into `unique_chars` at position `i`, increments `i`, and increments `j`.

3. **State After Loop:**
   - After the loop, `s` will be a string where each character that was in `unique_chars` has been replaced by the last unique character in `unique_chars` (repeated for each occurrence).
   - The `unique_chars` list will contain all characters from the original `s` in the order they first appeared.
   - The variables `i` and `j` will have values that do not contribute to the correct decoding.

4. **Return Statement:**
   ```python
   return ''.join(unique_chars)
   ```
   - The function returns a string consisting of all unique characters from the original `s` in the order they first appeared, which is not the correct decoded string.

### Corrected Function:
The corrected function should create a mapping from each character in the sorted unique characters to its symmetric counterpart and then use this mapping to decode the string.

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly decode the string as intended. The logic for replacing characters is flawed, and it does not maintain the correct mapping between the encoded and original characters.

Final: **False**
