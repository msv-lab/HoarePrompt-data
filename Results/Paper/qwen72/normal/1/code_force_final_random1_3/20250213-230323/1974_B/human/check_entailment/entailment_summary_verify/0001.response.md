### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Encoding Process**:
   - The encoding process involves creating a string `r` of unique characters from `s` in alphabetical order, and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - To decode, we need to reverse the encoding process. We should:
     - Identify the unique characters in the encoded string `b`.
     - Sort these unique characters to form the string `r`.
     - Replace each character in `b` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

3. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to perform the decoding.
   - It correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string `s` and sorts them.
   - However, the logic inside the loop is flawed:
     - The loop iterates over each character in `s` and attempts to replace it with the corresponding character from `unique_chars`.
     - The use of `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` is incorrect because it replaces all occurrences of `char` in `s` with `unique_chars[j]`, which is not what we want. We need to replace each character individually.
     - The `else` block where `unique_chars.insert(i, char)` is used is unnecessary and incorrect for this problem.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - We should create a mapping from each character in `s` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
   - Use this mapping to construct the decoded string.

5. **Proposed Fix**:
   - Create a dictionary to map each character in `s` to its symmetric counterpart.
   - Use this dictionary to construct the decoded string.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-1 - i] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        encoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(encoded_str)
```

### Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identified the flaws in the provided code, particularly the incorrect use of `s.replace` and the unnecessary `else` block.
- The proposed fix aligns with the correct approach of creating a mapping and using it to construct the decoded string.

### Final:
**False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the provided code, and the code is indeed incorrect as described. The corrected code provided above should work correctly for the given problem.
