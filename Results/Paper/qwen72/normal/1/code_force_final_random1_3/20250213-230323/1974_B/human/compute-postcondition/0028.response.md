Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing all unique characters from `s` in the order they first appeared. The input string `s` is modified during the function's execution, but the final state of `s` is not relevant to the function's output. The function ensures that the returned string contains each unique character from `s` exactly once, preserving their first occurrence order. **
