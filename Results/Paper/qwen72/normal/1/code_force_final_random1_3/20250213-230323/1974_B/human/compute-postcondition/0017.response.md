Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `s` is at least 1. If `char` is in `unique_chars`, all occurrences of `char` in `s` have been replaced with `unique_chars[j+1]`, and `char` is the next character in the updated string `s`, with `j` being `j - 1`. Otherwise, `char` is added to `unique_chars` at index `i-1`, `i` is increased by 1, and `j` is increased by 1.***
