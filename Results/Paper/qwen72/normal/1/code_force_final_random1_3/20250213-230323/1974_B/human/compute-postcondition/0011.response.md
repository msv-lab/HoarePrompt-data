The only object in the loop head is the variable `char` from the string `s`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more character left in `s` to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `s` is at least 1. The next character in `s` will be the new `char`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must still have at least one more character remaining.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `s` is at least 1. `char` is the next character in the string `s`.**
