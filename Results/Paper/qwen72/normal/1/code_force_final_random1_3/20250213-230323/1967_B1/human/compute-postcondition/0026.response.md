Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are input integers, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 5, `ans` is `n + (int(int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1 + int((int(n / 4) - 3) / 4) + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 5, `countmins` is 4, `g` is `int(n / 5)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.***
