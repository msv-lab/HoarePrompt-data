Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to new input integers, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n + sum(int((int(n / k) - (k - 1)) / k) + 1 for k in range(2, m + 1))`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `count` is updated from `m + 1` to 2.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `ans`, `countmins`, `g`) remain unchanged with their respective values or expressions.
