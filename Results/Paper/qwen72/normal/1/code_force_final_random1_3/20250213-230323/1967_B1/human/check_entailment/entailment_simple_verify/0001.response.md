### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), it must hold that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - Simplifying, we get \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This implies that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `n`, which is the number of pairs where \(b = 1\). This is correct because for \(b = 1\), \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\).
   - The loop iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 2 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values. The variable `countmins` is set to \(b - 1\), and `g` is set to \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\).
   - The condition `if g < countmins` breaks the loop if there are no valid \(a\) values for the current \(b\).
   - The number of valid \(a\) values is calculated as \(\left\lfloor \frac{g - (b - 1)}{b} \right\rfloor + 1\), and this value is added to `ans`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(b = 1\) correctly by initializing `ans` to `n`.
   - The loop ensures that for each \(b > 1\), the number of valid \(a\) values is correctly calculated and added to `ans`.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of the program is \(O(m)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).

### Verification Using Annotated Code:
- **Initialization**:
  - `t` is the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, `n` and `m` are read from input.
  - `count` is initialized to 2, and `ans` is initialized to `n`.

- **Loop**:
  - The loop runs while `count` is less than or equal to `m`.
  - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
  - `g` is set to \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{count} \right\rfloor\).
  - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
  - Otherwise, the number of valid \(a\) values is calculated as \(\left\lfloor \frac{g - (b - 1)}{b} \right\rfloor + 1\) and added to `ans`.
  - `count` is incremented by 1.

- **Output**:
  - After the loop, `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the edge cases and efficiently calculates the number of valid pairs for each test case. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
