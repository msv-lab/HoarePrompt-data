Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to new input integers, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / count)`**

Explanation: The value of `g` is updated to `int(n / count)`. Since `count` is 2, `g` is now `int(n / 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
