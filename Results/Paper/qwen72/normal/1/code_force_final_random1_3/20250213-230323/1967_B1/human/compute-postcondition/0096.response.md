Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It then performs a series of calculations to compute a value `ans` based on `n` and `m`. The final computed value `ans` is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. The state after the function concludes includes the final values of `n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` as described in the annotations, but the primary output is the printed values of `ans` for each test case. **
