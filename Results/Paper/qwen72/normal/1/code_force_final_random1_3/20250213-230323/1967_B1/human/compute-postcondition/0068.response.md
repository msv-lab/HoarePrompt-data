Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to new input integers, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `countmins` is updated to `int(count - 1)`. Since `count` is 2, `countmins` becomes `int(2 - 1)`, which is 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, and `g`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
