Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to new input integers, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / count) - countmins) / count) + 1 + int(g / count) + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 4, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `int(n / count) - countmins`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to its current value.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `countmins`, `g`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement remains valid if `g` is less than `countmins`.
