### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), it must hold that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - Simplifying, we get \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This implies that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `n`, which is the number of pairs where \(b = 1\). This is correct because for \(b = 1\), \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\).
   - The loop iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 2 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values. The variable `countmins` is set to \(b - 1\), and `g` is set to \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\).
   - The condition `if g < countmins` breaks the loop if there are no valid \(a\) values for the current \(b\).
   - The number of valid \(a\) values is calculated as \(\left\lfloor \frac{g - (b - 1)}{b} \right\rfloor + 1\), and this value is added to `ans`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(b = 1\) correctly by initializing `ans` to `n`.
   - The loop ensures that for each \(b > 1\), the number of valid \(a\) values is correctly calculated and added to `ans`.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of the program is \(O(m)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).

6. **Verification with Annotations**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes each test case and computes the number of valid pairs.
   - The state variables are updated correctly within the loop, and the final value of `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the edge cases and efficiently calculates the number of valid pairs for each test case.

Final: **True**
