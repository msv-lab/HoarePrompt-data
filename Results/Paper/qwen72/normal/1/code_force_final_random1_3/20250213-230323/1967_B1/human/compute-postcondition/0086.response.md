Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to new input integers, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `count` is 5, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / count) - countmins) / count) + 1 + int(g / count) + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 4, `countmins` is 4, `g` is `int(n / count)`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `int(n / count)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `g` is used in the expression for `ans`, but `ans` itself is not recalculated in this code snippet.
