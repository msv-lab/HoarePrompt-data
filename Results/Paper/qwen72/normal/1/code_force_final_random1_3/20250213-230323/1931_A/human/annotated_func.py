#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the input is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines, each containing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` is equal to `t - 1`, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each iteration, `n` is an input integer, and `word` is determined as follows: If `n` > 52, `word` is the character at position `n - 53` in the `alphabet` list followed by `'zz'`. If `n` > 26 and `n` ≤ 52, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. If `n` ≤ 26, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`. Each `word` is printed on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It first reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) and generates a string `word` based on the value of `n`:
- If `n` > 52, `word` is the character at position `n - 53` in the lowercase English alphabet followed by `'zz'`.
- If `n` > 26 and `n` ≤ 52, `word` is `'a'` followed by the character at position `n - 28` in the alphabet and then `'z'`.
- If `n` ≤ 26, `word` is `'aa'` followed by the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet.
After processing each test case, the generated `word` is printed on a new line. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
