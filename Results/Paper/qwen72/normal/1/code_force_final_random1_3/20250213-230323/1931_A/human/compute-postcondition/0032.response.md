Output State: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` is equal to `t - 1`, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each iteration, `n` is an input integer, and `word` is determined as follows: If `n` > 52, `word` is the character at position `n - 53` in the `alphabet` list followed by `'zz'`. If `n` > 26 and `n` ≤ 52, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. If `n` ≤ 26, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`. Each `word` is printed on a new line.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the loop variable `i` will be one less than the total number of test cases `t`. For each test case, the value of `n` is taken from the input, and the string `word` is constructed based on the rules provided in the loop. The final state of `word` for each test case is printed, and the loop terminates after processing all `t` test cases.
