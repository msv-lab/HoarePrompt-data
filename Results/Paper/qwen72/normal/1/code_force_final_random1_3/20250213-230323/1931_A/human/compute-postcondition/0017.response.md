The code snippet updates the `word` variable by appending the character from the `alphabet` list at the index `n - 53` followed by the string `'zz'`. Since `word` was initially an empty string (`''`), after executing the code, `word` will contain the character from `alphabet[n - 53]` followed by `'zz'`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.**
