The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. However, based on the context provided, it is expected to handle multiple test cases. The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), which represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines, each containing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78). The function processes each of these integers and returns a result for each test case.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and then for each of the `t` test cases, read an integer `n` and return a result based on the processing of `n`.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each of the `t` test cases, reads an integer `n` and returns a result based on the processing of `n`.**
