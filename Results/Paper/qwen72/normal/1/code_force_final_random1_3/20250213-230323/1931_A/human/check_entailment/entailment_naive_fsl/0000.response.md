Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic used to construct the lexicographically smallest word is flawed. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

- Input: `n = 48`
- Expected Output: `auz`
- Actual Output: `aa{` (which is incorrect because `{` is not a valid lowercase letter)

The issue lies in the logic for constructing the word when `n` is less than or equal to 52. The program incorrectly adds `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`, which can result in invalid characters if `n - 3` exceeds the length of the alphabet. 

To fix this, the program needs to correctly handle the construction of the word for all possible values of `n` within the given constraints.
