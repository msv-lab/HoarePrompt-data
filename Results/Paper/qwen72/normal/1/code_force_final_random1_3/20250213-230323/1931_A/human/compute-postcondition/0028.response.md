Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `word` is 'aa' + `alphabet[n - 3]`.**

Explanation: The code concatenates the string `'aa'` with the character at index `n - 3` from the `alphabet` string and assigns the result to `word`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The new value of `word` depends on the value of `n` and the content of `alphabet`.
