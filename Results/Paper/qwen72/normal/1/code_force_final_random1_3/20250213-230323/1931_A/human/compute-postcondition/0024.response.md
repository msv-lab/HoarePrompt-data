Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to an integer provided by the user. The value of `i` remains unchanged. The conditions for setting the value of `word` are not evaluated because they depend on the value of `n` after the input, which is not specified here. Therefore, the only change is that `n` now holds the value of the input integer.
