Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and m is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The string s is of length m and consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt = 0
        
        cur = 0
        
        ans = ''
        
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
                ans += ss
        
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                    break
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `i` is `t-1` (which would be -1 since `t` is 0), `n`, `k`, and `m` are the final input integers for the last test case, `s` is the final input string for the last test case, `cnt` is the total number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the last test case, `ans` is the final string constructed during the last test case, and `cur` is the final bitmask value after processing all characters in the last test case. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" followed by the string `ans` concatenated with `tmp` (if `tmp` is not an empty string) and `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by parameters `n`, `k`, `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` can be partitioned into `n` substrings such that each substring contains all `k` distinct characters. If it can, the function prints "YES". If it cannot, the function prints "NO" followed by a modified version of the string `s` that includes additional characters to meet the requirement. The function reads inputs from standard input and prints results to standard output. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.
