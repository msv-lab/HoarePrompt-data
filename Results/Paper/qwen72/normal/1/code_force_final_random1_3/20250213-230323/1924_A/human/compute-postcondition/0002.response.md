The code snippet `n, k, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into three parts, and assigns each part to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m` after converting them to integers.

- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `k` is assigned the second integer from the input.
- `m` is assigned the third integer from the input.

The variables `t` and `i` are not affected by this code, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**
