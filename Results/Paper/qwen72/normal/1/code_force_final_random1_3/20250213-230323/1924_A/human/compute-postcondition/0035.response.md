Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution.
- `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0.
- `cur` is the final bitmask value after processing all characters in `s`.
- `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Given the `print('YES')` statement, the output will always be 'YES' because the print statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
