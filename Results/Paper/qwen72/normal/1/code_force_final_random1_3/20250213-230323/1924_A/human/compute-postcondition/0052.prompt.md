Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0, `cur` is the final bitmask value after processing all characters in `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0, `cur` is the final bitmask value after processing all characters in `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, and `tmp` is either an empty string or 'a'. If the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, then `tmp` is 'a' and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `cur`) remain unchanged. If the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, `tmp` is set to 'b' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `cur`) remain unchanged. If the bit at position 2 of `cur` is 0, `tmp` is set to 'c' and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the variables remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
