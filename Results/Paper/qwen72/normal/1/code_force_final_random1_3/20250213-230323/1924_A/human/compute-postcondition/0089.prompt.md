Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string with at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is either 0 or remains unchanged, and `cur_ss` is either `ord(s[0]) - 97` if the bit corresponding to `ord(s[0]) - 97` was not set in `(1 << k) - 1` initially, or remains unchanged. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the string representation of `cur_ss`, and `cur` is set to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string with at least one character, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[1]) - 97`, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`. If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the second character of `s`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `ans` remains an empty string, and `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string with at least three characters, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[2]) - ord('a')`, and `ss` is the third character in the string `s`. If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is 1, and `ans` is the third character in the string `s`. Otherwise, `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
