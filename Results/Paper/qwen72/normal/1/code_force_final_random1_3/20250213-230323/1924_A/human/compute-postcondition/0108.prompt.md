Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` has been met during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is 0 if the last iteration of the loop caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed but did not cause `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` has been met during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is 0 if the last iteration of the loop caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed but did not cause `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is 'b' if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` has been met during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is 0 if the last iteration of the loop caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed but did not cause `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is less than `n`. If the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'c' and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 3, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` has been met during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is 0 if the last iteration of the loop caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed but did not cause `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is less than `n`. If the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'd' and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
