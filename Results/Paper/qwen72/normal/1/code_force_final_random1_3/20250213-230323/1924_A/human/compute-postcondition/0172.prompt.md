Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and m is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The string s is of length m and consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    ans = ''
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
            ans += ss
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                break
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0, and `cur` is the final bitmask value after processing all characters in `s`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `i` is set to `k-1`, `ans` is updated to `ans + tmp + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`, and `tmp` remains unchanged while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`) remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k`. `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` has been met during the loop. `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is further concatenated with the value of `tmp` (if `tmp` is not an empty string) and `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times. `cur` is 0 if the last iteration of the loop caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed but did not cause `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 2, and `cur` is 0 if `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the loop, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1` plus the value of `tmp` followed by `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters, and `cur` is 0 if `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the loop, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
