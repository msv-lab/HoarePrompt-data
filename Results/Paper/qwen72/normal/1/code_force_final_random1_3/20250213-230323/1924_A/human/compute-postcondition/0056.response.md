Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0, and `cur` is the final bitmask value after processing all characters in `s`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `i` is set to `k-1`, `ans` is updated to `ans + tmp + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`, and `tmp` remains unchanged while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`) remain unchanged.***
