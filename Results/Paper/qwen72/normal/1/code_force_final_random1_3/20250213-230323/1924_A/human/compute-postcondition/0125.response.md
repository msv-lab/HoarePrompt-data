Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `ss` minus 97 (which is the ASCII value of 'a'). If the bit in `cur` corresponding to the position `cur_ss` is 0, then `cur` is updated to `1 << cur_ss` and the bit in `cur` corresponding to the position `cur_ss` is now 1. Otherwise, all variables remain unchanged.***
