The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the value of `ss` to the string `ans`. Since `ans` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `ans` will be equal to `ss`.

Given that `ss` is defined as the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus 97, and `s` is a new input string with at least 3 characters, `ss` is a specific integer value.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 3 characters, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the string representation of the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus 97, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus 97, `cur` is 0.**
