The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The initial state specifies that `cnt` is 0 if `cur` was not equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the start of the if statement, and `cnt` remains 1 if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the start of the if statement.

Let's break down the impact:

1. If `cur` was not equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the start of the if statement, `cnt` was 0. After executing `cnt += 1`, `cnt` becomes 1.
2. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the start of the if statement, `cnt` was 1. After executing `cnt += 1`, `cnt` becomes 2.

All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, `cur`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string that must have at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `1 << cur_ss` plus `1 << cur_ss` if `cur` was not equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the start of the if statement, otherwise `cur` is 0. `cnt` is 1 if `cur` was not equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the start of the if statement, otherwise `cnt` is 2. `ans` remains the first two characters of `s` if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the start of the if statement, otherwise `ans` remains an empty string.**
