Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string that must have at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the start of the if statement, then `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 1, and `ans` is the first two characters of `s` concatenated with the third character of `s`. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to `1 << cur_ss` plus `1 << cur_ss` if `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, and `cnt` remains 0, and `ans` remains an empty string.***
