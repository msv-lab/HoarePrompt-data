### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the given string `s`.
   - If not, provide one such string that is not a subsequence.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to count the number of valid subsequences found, `cur` to track the current bitmask of characters seen, and `ans` to store the result string.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`:
     - Converts the character to its corresponding index in the alphabet.
     - Updates the bitmask `cur` if the character has not been seen before.
     - If all `k` characters have been seen (i.e., `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`), it increments `cnt` and resets `cur`.
     - Appends the character to `ans`.
   - After processing the string, it checks if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`:
     - If true, it prints "YES".
     - If false, it prints "NO" and constructs a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence:
       - Finds the first character not seen in `s` and appends it to `ans`.
       - Appends 'a' to `ans` until it reaches length `n`.

3. **Issues in the Program:**
   - **Bitmask Usage:** The bitmask `cur` is used to track the presence of characters in the current window of length `k`. However, the program does not correctly handle the generation of all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters.
   - **Subsequence Check:** The program does not check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. Instead, it counts the number of times a complete set of `k` characters appears in `s`.
   - **String Construction:** The logic for constructing the string that is not a subsequence is flawed. It appends a character not seen in `s` and then appends 'a' to reach length `n`, which does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
     - Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
     - Check if each generated string is a subsequence of `s`.
     - If any generated string is not a subsequence, print "NO" and the string.
     - If all generated strings are subsequences, print "YES".

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It has logical issues in constructing the string that is not a subsequence and in handling the result.

Final: **False**
