Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` has been met during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, and `cur` is 0 if the last iteration of the loop caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed but did not cause `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
- For each character, `cur_ss` is calculated as the position of the character in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).
- If the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` is not set in `cur`, it is set.
- If `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`, it means that `k` unique characters have been processed, and `cnt` is incremented, `ans` is updated with the current character, and `cur` is reset to 0.
- After all iterations, `cnt` will be the number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively, and `ans` will be the concatenation of the characters that caused these resets.
- `cur` will be 0 if the last set of `k` unique characters was found, otherwise, it will be the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters that were processed but did not complete a full set of `k` unique characters.
