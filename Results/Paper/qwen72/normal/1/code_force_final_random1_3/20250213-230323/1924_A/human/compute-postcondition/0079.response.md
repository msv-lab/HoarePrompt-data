The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the value of `ss` to the string `ans`. Given that `ans` was initially an empty string and `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, after executing this line, `ans` will contain the second character of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string with at least one character, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[1]) - 97`, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur` is 0.**
