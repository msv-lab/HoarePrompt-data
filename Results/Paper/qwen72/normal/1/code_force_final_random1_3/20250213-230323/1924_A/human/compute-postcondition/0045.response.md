Output State: **`i` is 1, `tmp` is 'b', all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `cur`) remain unchanged.** 

Explanation: The value of `i` is 1, and `tmp` is set to the character obtained by converting the ASCII value of 'a' plus `i` (which is 1) to a character, resulting in 'b'. All other variables remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
