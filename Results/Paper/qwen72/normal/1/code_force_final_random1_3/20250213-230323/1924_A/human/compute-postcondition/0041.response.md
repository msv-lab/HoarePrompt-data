The code snippet `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns the character corresponding to the ASCII value of 'a' plus the value of `i` to the variable `tmp`. Given that `i` is 0, `ord('a')` is 97, and adding 0 to 97 gives 97, which corresponds to the character 'a'. Therefore, `tmp` is set to 'a'.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0, `cur` is the final bitmask value after processing all characters in `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is 'a', and the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0.**
