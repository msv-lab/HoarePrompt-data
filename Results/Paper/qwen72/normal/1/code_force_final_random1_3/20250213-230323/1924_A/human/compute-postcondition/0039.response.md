To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the loop head:

```python
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `k`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0, because `range(k)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `k-1`, and if `k` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution
- `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0
- `cur` is the final bitmask value after processing all characters in `s`
- `cnt` is less than `n`
- `tmp` is an empty string

We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `k` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is already set to 0, which is appropriate for the start of the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0, `cur` is the final bitmask value after processing all characters in `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string**
