The code snippet `ans += tmp` appends the value of `tmp` to the string `ans`. Based on the initial state, `tmp` could either be a character from the alphabet or an empty string, depending on whether the bit at position `i` in `cur` was 0. 

- If the bit at position `i` in `cur` was 0, `tmp` is a character from the alphabet, and `ans` is updated by appending this character.
- If the bit at position `i` in `cur` was not 0, `tmp` remains an empty string, and `ans` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` has been met during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1` plus the value of `tmp` (if `tmp` is not an empty string), `cur` is 0 if the last iteration of the loop caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed but did not cause `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is less than `n`.**
