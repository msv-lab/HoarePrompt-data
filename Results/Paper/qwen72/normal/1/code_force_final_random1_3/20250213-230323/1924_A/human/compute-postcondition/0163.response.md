The code snippet `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns to `tmp` the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the value of `i`. Given that `i` is 2, `ord('a')` is 97, so `ord('a') + i` is 99, which corresponds to the character `'c'`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are greater than 0, `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is 0 if `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the loop, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is `'c'`.**
