Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    func_16()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads an integer from the standard input (stdin) and returns it. It does not accept any parameters. After the function concludes, the program has read one line of input from stdin and converted it to an integer, which is then returned.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  Reads a line of input from standard input (stdin), splits the line into separate integers, and returns an iterator of these integers. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the caller will have an iterator over the integers read from the input.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input, splits the line into parts, converts each part into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. After the function concludes, the program has a list of integers derived from the input line.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` and returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` `rows_number` times. If `rows_number` is 0, it returns an empty list.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads the next line of input from standard input (stdin) and returns it as a byte string with trailing whitespace removed.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  Reads a line of input from the standard input, expecting a space-separated string of integers, and returns a list of these integers.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `rows`, which is a non-negative integer. It returns a list containing the results of calling `func_7()` `rows` times. Each element in the list is the result of one call to `func_7()`.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user for input and returns whatever the user enters. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned the user's input.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer value from the user input and returns this integer. After the function concludes, the program has returned an integer value entered by the user.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits this input by whitespace, and returns a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input data. After the function concludes, the program has a list of strings derived from the user's input.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` takes four parameters: `d`, `processing`, `da`, and `rank`. `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers. `processing` is a list of integers of length at least the maximum key in `d`. `da` is an integer key present in `d`. `rank` is a list of integers of length at least the maximum key in `d`. If the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (as indicated by `processing`). It updates the `processing` list to mark elements as processed temporarily and then resets them. The function returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value obtained from the recursive calls. Additionally, the value of `rank[da - 1]` is updated to `tmp + 1`.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns a tuple `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and returns a tuple containing the second element from the recursive call, the result of `x - a // b * y` (where `x` and `y` are the first and second elements from the recursive call, respectively), and the third element from the recursive call. The final state of the program is that it returns a tuple of three values, which are derived from the recursive calls and the initial inputs `a` and `b`.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where `0 <= n <= len(a)`), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`, and for each element less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and that element. After the iteration, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function modifies the value of `k` based on the elements of `a` and the given threshold `m`, and the final state of the program is determined by the value of `k` after the iteration.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` takes no parameters and returns an integer value. It internally uses the values of `n` and `m` obtained from the function `func_7`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. The function calculates the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all integers \( j \) from 1 up to the largest integer \( i - 1 \) such that \( i^2 \leq n + i \). The final result returned is this sum minus 1.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It calls `func_10` to get a non-negative integer, which determines the number of times `func_15` is called. For each call to `func_15`, the result is converted to a string and printed to the console on a new line. After the function completes, the specified number of values from `func_15` have been printed to the console.
