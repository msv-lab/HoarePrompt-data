The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns a tuple `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and returns a tuple containing the second element from the recursive call, the result of `x - a // b * y` (where `x` and `y` are the first and second elements from the recursive call, respectively), and the third element from the recursive call. The final state of the program is that it returns a tuple of three values, which are derived from the recursive calls and the initial inputs `a` and `b`.
