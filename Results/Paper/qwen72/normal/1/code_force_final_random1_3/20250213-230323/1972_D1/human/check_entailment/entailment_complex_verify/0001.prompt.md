You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

For each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0, `processing[di - 1]` has been temporarily set to 1 during the loop but is reset back to 0 after the loop iteration.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` takes four parameters: `d`, `processing`, `da`, and `rank`. `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers. `processing` is a list of integers of length at least the maximum key in `d`. `da` is an integer key present in `d`. `rank` is a list of integers of length at least the maximum key in `d`. If the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (as indicated by `processing`). It updates the `processing` list to mark elements as processed temporarily and then resets them. The function returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value obtained from the recursive calls. Additionally, the value of `rank[da - 1]` is updated to `tmp + 1`.

#Function 13:

        #The program returns (1, 0, a), where 'a' is a non-negative integer.
    #State: a and b are non-negative integers, and b is not equal to 0
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns a tuple containing `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the results of the function `func_13(b, a % b)`. Here, `y` is the second element from the result of `func_13(b, a % b)`, `x - a // b * y` is calculated using the first element `x` from the result of `func_13(b, a % b)` and the integer division of `a` by `b`, and `g` is the third element from the result of `func_13(b, a % b)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns a tuple `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and returns a tuple containing the second element from the recursive call, the result of `x - a // b * y` (where `x` and `y` are the first and second elements from the recursive call, respectively), and the third element from the recursive call. The final state of the program is that it returns a tuple of three values, which are derived from the recursive calls and the initial inputs `a` and `b`.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), m is a positive integer, and k is an integer.

For each index `j` from 0 to `n-1`, if `a[j] < m`, then `k` is updated to `k - (m - a[j])`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.
    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq \text{len}(a)\), `m` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, and `i` is `n-1`. For each index `j` from 0 to `n-1`, if `a[j] < m`, then `k` is updated to `k - (m - a[j])`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. Additionally, `k` is less than 0.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where `0 <= n <= len(a)`), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`, and for each element less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and that element. After the iteration, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function modifies the value of `k` based on the elements of `a` and the given threshold `m`, and the final state of the program is determined by the value of `k` after the iteration.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.

        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \( i^2 > n + i \), `ans` is the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( i - 1 \).
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( i - 1 \), and `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \( i^2 > n + i \).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` takes no parameters and returns an integer value. It internally uses the values of `n` and `m` obtained from the function `func_7`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. The function calculates the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all integers \( j \) from 1 up to the largest integer \( i - 1 \) such that \( i^2 \leq n + i \). The final result returned is this sum minus 1.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_16`.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `func_15()` has been called as many times as the value returned by `func_10()`, and its result (which is a value) has been printed to the console for each call.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It calls `func_10` to get a non-negative integer, which determines the number of times `func_15` is called. For each call to `func_15`, the result is converted to a string and printed to the console on a new line. After the function completes, the specified number of values from `func_15` have been printed to the console.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_15**: This function is supposed to solve the problem for a single test case.
     - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
     - It enters a loop where it increments `i` and updates `ans` based on the condition \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
     - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

   - **func_16**: This function handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases using `func_10()`.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_15()` and writes the result to standard output.

3. **Correctness of func_15**:
   - The logic in `func_15` does not directly address the problem statement. Specifically, it does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The loop and the condition \((n + i) // (i * i)\) do not seem to be related to the problem's requirements.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions do not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. The logic in `func_15` is not aligned with the problem's constraints and conditions.

Correctness: **False**
