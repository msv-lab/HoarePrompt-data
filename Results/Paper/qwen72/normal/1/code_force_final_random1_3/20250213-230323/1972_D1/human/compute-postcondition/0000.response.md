The only object in the loop head is the result of `func_10()`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0. Since no variables are passed to `func_16`, there are no other states to adjust.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0**
