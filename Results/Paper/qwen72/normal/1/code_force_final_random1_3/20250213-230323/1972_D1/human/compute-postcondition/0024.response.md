Functionality: ** The function `func_12` takes four parameters: `d`, `processing`, `da`, and `rank`. `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers. `processing` is a list of integers of length at least the maximum key in `d`. `da` is an integer key present in `d`. `rank` is a list of integers of length at least the maximum key in `d`. If the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (as indicated by `processing`). It updates the `processing` list to mark elements as processed temporarily and then resets them. The function returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value obtained from the recursive calls. Additionally, the value of `rank[da - 1]` is updated to `tmp + 1`. **
