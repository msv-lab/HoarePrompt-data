Functionality: **The function `func_12` accepts four parameters: `d`, `processing`, `da`, and `rank`. `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers. `processing` is a list of integers of length at least the maximum key in `d`. `da` is an integer key present in `d`. `rank` is a list of integers of length at least the maximum key in `d`. The function returns 1 if certain conditions are met. Otherwise, it returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value between the initial `tmp` (1000000000) and the results of recursive calls to `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. Additionally, the value of `rank[da - 1]` is updated to `tmp + 1`.**
