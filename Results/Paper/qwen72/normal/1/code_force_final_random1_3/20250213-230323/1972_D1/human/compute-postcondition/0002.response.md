The only object in the loop head is the result of `func_10()`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `func_10()`. If `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, and `func_15()` has been called and its result has been printed to the console.

For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must still return a value greater than 0. The state of `_` is not relevant since it is a throwaway variable used in the loop.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `func_15()` has been called and its result (which is a value) has been printed to the console.**
