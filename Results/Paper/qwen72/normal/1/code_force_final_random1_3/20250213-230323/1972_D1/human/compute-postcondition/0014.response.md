Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \( i^2 > n + i \), `ans` is the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( i - 1 \).**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These values remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: The loop continues to increment `i` until the condition \( i^2 > n + i \) is met. Therefore, `i` will be the smallest integer greater than 1 that satisfies this condition.
- **`ans`**: The variable `ans` accumulates the value of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for each iteration of the loop, where \( j \) starts from 1 and increments by 1 until the loop condition fails. Thus, `ans` is the sum of these values for all \( j \) from 1 to \( i - 1 \).
