Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_15` does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\) and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The logic inside `func_15` seems to be unrelated to the problem statement and does not handle the required conditions. For example, the loop and the condition inside `func_15` do not reflect the necessary checks for the pairs (a, b) as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
