Output State: **The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( i - 1 \), and `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \( i^2 > n + i \).** 

In natural language, this means the program calculates the sum of the integer division of \((n + j)\) by \(j^2\) for each \(j\) from 1 up to \(i - 1\), where \(i\) is the smallest integer greater than 1 that satisfies the condition \(i^2 > n + i\). The final result is this sum minus 1.
