Postcondition: ***`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `da` is an integer key present in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `tmp` is 1000000000 or the minimum value between the original `tmp` (1000000000) and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`, `di` is the third element of `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, then `processing[di - 1]` is updated to 1, and `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. Otherwise, all variables remain unchanged.***
