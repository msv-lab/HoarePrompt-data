### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate or not.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_10`**:
   - Reads an integer from the standard input, which represents the number of test cases \(t\).

2. **Function `func_15`**:
   - Reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the standard input.
   - Initializes a variable `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - Enters a loop where it increments `i` until \(i^2 > n + i\).
   - Inside the loop, it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`.
   - Returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Function `func_16`**:
   - Calls `func_10` to get the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it calls `func_15` and prints the result.

#### Evaluation of `func_15`:
- The function `func_15` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
- However, the logic inside `func_15` does not match the problem requirements:
  - The loop condition \(i^2 \leq n + i\) and the calculation \((n + i) // (i * i)\) do not correspond to the conditions \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
  - There is no logic to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the conditions.

#### Example Verification:
- For the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the correct output should be 14, as listed in the problem description.
- The function `func_15` does not produce this output because it is not designed to solve the problem correctly.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The function `func_15` does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions specified in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
