t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of: n, f, a, b are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of messages, initial phone charge, charge consumption per unit of time, and charge consumption for turning the phone off and on, respectively. m_1, m_2, ..., m_n are integers where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
