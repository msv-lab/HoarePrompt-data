To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `test_cases` is greater than 0
- `feat` is a list of integers input by the user
- `n` is the first element of `feat`
- `f` is the second element of `feat`
- `a` is the third element of `feat`
- `b` is the last element of `feat`
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user
- `array2` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. If the difference between the second element of `arr` and the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n`.

### Adjustments:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- To start the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.
- The condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to execute again. Since `n` is greater than 1, it must now be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

### Updated State:
- `i` is now 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, and `array2` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. If the difference between the second element of `arr` and the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.**
