Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, each involving the number of messages, initial phone charge, charge loss per unit time, and charge loss for turning the phone on and off. For each test case, it reads the input values and calculates whether the total charge loss required to send all messages (considering both continuous charge loss and the charge loss for turning the phone on and off) is less than the initial phone charge. If the total charge loss is less than the initial charge, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case. **
