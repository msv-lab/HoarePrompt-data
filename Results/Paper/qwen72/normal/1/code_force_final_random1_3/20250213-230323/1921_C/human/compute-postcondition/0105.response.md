Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` must be less than `test_cases`, and `i` is `n-1`. If `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `arr[0] * a`. For each subsequent index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its full range. The list `array2` will contain the results of the conditions specified in the loop for each valid index `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Specifically, if the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is met for any `i` (with special handling for `i = 0`), the corresponding value will be appended to `array2`. If none of the conditions are met, `array2` will remain an empty list.
