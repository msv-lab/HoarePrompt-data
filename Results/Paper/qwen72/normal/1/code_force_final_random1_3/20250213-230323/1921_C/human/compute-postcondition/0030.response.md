Output State: **`i` is `feat[0]`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` contains the values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is true.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `b` to be the last element of the `feat` list. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and values specified in the initial state are still valid.
