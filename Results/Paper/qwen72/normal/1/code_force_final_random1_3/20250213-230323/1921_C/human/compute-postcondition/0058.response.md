Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` is an empty list, and the difference between the second element and the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`.**
