To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `feat` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 1.
- `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list.
- `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list.
- `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `n` must be less than `test_cases`.
- `i` is 1.
- If `i` is 0, `array2` remains an empty list.
- If `i` is 1 and the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`.
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i` is 1 and the loop is still executing).

### Adjusted State:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 2, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` must be less than `test_cases`, `i` is 2. If `i` is 0, `array2` remains an empty list. If `i` is 1 and the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.**
