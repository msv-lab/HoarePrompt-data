The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of messages.
  - `f`: An integer where 1 ≤ f ≤ 10^9, representing the initial phone charge.
  - `a`: An integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, representing the charge consumption per unit of time.
  - `b`: An integer where 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9, representing the charge consumption for turning the phone off and on.
  - `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`: A list of integers where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent.

The function returns a list of results, one for each test case. Each result indicates whether the phone can send all the messages without running out of charge. If the phone can send all messages, the result is `True`; otherwise, it is `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of messages, initial phone charge, charge consumption per unit of time, charge consumption for turning the phone off and on, and the moments at which messages need to be sent. It returns a list of boolean values indicating whether the phone can send all messages without running out of charge for each test case.**
