To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `feat` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `n` is the first element of the `feat` list and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
   - `f` is the second element of the `feat` list.
   - `a` is the third element of the `feat` list.
   - `b` is the last element of the `feat` list.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `n` must be less than `test_cases`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.

2. **Conditions and Operations:**
   - If `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `arr[0] * a`.
   - For each subsequent index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.
   - Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.
   - The sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code prints `'Yes'`.

Given the conditions and operations, the print statement will execute if all the conditions are met. Specifically, the conditions ensure that the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`.

Since the conditions are met, the print statement will execute and print `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
