Postcondition: **`feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` must be less than `test_cases`, and `i` is `n-1`. If `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `arr[0] * a`. For each subsequent index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged. The sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is either less than `f` or greater than or equal to `f`.**
