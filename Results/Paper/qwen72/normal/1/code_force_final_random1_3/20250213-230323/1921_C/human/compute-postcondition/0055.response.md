Output State: **`i` is `feat[0]`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` is a list containing elements `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * feat[2]` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is true, and if the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]` reads a space-separated list of integers from the user and assigns it to the variable `arr`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `test_cases`, and `array2`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition involving `array2` and `f` remains the same as described in the initial state.
