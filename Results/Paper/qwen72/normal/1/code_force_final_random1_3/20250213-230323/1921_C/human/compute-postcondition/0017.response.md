Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a` and now also contains the value `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`.
- Given `i` is 3, the value appended is `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
