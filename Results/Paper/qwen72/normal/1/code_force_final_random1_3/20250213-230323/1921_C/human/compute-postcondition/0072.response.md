Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` is `feat[0]`
- `f` is `feat[1]`
- `a` is `feat[2]`
- `b` is `feat[-1]`
- `test_cases` is greater than `n`
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user
- `array2` contains the values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * feat[2]` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[j] - arr[j-1]` is less than `b / a`
- The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('No')
```

The `print` statement simply prints the string `'No'`. There are no variables or conditions evaluated within the `print` statement itself. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **No**
