The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `y` was 2, so the new value of `y` is 3. The other variables (`x`, `cnt`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 4, `y` is 3, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1. `n` is at least 20, and `m` is at least 5.**
