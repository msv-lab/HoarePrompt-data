To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and its impact on the variables:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be at least 8
- `m` must be at least 8
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 2
- `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / 6` and `m // 3` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y`**:
   - `x` is 2
   - `y` is 2
   - `(x + y) * x = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`
   - `(x + y) * y = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`

2. **Evaluate the conditions**:
   - `(x + y) * x <= n` translates to `8 <= n`, which is true since `n` is at least 8.
   - `(x + y) * y <= m` translates to `8 <= m`, which is true since `m` is at least 8.
   - `gcd(x, y) == 1` is false because `gcd(2, 2) == 2`.

3. **Since `gcd(x, y) == 1` is false, the pair `(2, 2)` does not contribute to the initial `cnt` calculation.** However, the code snippet still updates `cnt` based on the current values of `n` and `m`.

4. **Calculate the new value to add to `cnt`**:
   - `n / ((x + y) * x) = n / 8`
   - `m // ((x + y) * y) = m // 8`
   - `min(n / 8, m // 8)` is the minimum of these two values.

5. **Update `cnt`**:
   - `cnt` is incremented by `min(n / 8, m // 8)`.

### Output State:
- `n` must be at least 8
- `m` must be at least 8
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 2
- `cnt` is now `cnt + min(n / 8, m // 8)`

Output State: **`n` must be at least 8, `m` must be at least 8, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `cnt` is now `cnt + min(n / 8, m // 8)`**.
