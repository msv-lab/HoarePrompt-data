Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` and `m` remain positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `x` is 1, `y` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.** 

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `y` will be the smallest value greater than 1 that causes either `(x + y) * x` to exceed `n` or `(x + y) * y` to exceed `m`. The variable `cnt` will be the sum of the minimum values of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all valid pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial values.
