To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition:

```python
while x * x <= n:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `x * x <= n`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
   - `x` is 2.
   - `y` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \((x + y) \times x > n\) or \((x + y) \times y > m\).
   - `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of \(n / ((x + y) \times x)\) and \(m // ((x + y) \times y)\) for all pairs \((x, y)\) where \(\gcd(x, y) == 1\) and \((x + y) \times x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \times y \leq m\).

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop condition depends on `x` and `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x * x` must still be less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Current Values**:
   - `x` is 2.
   - `x * x` is \(2 * 2 = 4\).
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `x` is 2 and `x * x` is 4, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute one more time.
   - No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `x` and `n`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `m` remain positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `x` is 2, `y` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`, and `n` must be at least 4**.
