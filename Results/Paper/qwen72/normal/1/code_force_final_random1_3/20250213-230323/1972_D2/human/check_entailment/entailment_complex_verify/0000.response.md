### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description and Input Handling**:
   - The problem specifies that the input consists of multiple test cases, with the first line containing the number of test cases `t`.
   - Each test case contains two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program does not handle the input format correctly for multiple test cases.
   - Specifically, `func_1` reads `n` and `m` directly from the input without considering the number of test cases, which means it will only process the first test case and ignore the rest.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - `func_1` reads `n` and `m` from the input, but it does so inside a loop that is intended to handle one test case at a time.

4. **Behavior of the Program**:
   - When `func_2` is called, it reads `t` and then calls `func_1` `t` times.
   - Each call to `func_1` reads `n` and `m` from the input, processes the pairs, and prints the count of valid pairs.
   - This means that for each test case, `func_1` is called and processes the corresponding `n` and `m` values.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - The input format is correctly handled, and each test case is processed independently.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the program does handle multiple test cases correctly.
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case as required by the problem description.

Final: **True**
