Output State: **`x` is 4, `y` is 5, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1. `n` is at least 32, and `m` is at least 25.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to increment `y` by 1 in each iteration until the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` is no longer satisfied.
- After the third iteration, `y` is 4, and the conditions are still met because `n` is at least 28 and `m` is at least 21.
- In the fourth iteration, `y` becomes 5. The conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` become `(4 + 5) * 4 <= n` and `(4 + 5) * 5 <= m`, which simplify to `36 <= n` and `45 <= m`.
- Since `n` must be at least 32 and `m` must be at least 25, the loop will execute one more time with `y = 5`.
- After the fourth iteration, `y` becomes 5, and the loop terminates because `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y` exceed the limits of `n` and `m`.

Thus, the final output state is `x` is 4, `y` is 5, and `cnt` is updated based on the conditions described.
