You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1

    print(cnt)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to solve one test case.
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Detailed Breakdown of `func_1`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `x` starts at 1.
     - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to count the valid pairs.
   - **Loop Over `x`:**
     - The loop runs while \(x \times x \le n\). This ensures that \(x\) does not exceed the square root of \(n\).
   - **Inner Loop Over `y`:**
     - For each `x`, `y` starts at 1 and increments until \((x + y) \times x \le n\) and \((x + y) \times y \le m\).
   - **GCD Check:**
     - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it means \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.
   - **Count Valid Pairs:**
     - The number of valid pairs is incremented by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \times x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \times y} \right\rfloor\).
   - **Print Result:**
     - After the loops, the count of valid pairs is printed.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The algorithm correctly iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) within the given constraints.
   - The GCD check ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, which is necessary for the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - The counting logic is correct as it uses the minimum of the two bounds to ensure both conditions are satisfied.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The algorithm handles edge cases where \(n\) and \(m\) are small (e.g., \(n = 1, m = 1\)) and large (e.g., \(n = 1000000, m = 1145141\)).
   - The use of integer division and floor functions ensures that the counts are accurate.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly solves the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
