To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `n` must be at least 8.
   - `m` must be at least 8.
   - `x` is 2.
   - `y` is 3.
   - `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / 6` and `m // 3` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by `min(n / 8, m // 8)`.

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
   - Substituting the current values:
     - `(x + y) * x = (2 + 3) * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10`
     - `(x + y) * y = (2 + 3) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - Therefore, the conditions become:
     - `10 <= n`
     - `15 <= m`

4. **Determine the Required Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true.
   - Since `n` must be at least 8 and `m` must be at least 8, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 10 and `m` is at least 15.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - `n` must be at least 10.
   - `m` must be at least 15.
   - The values of `x` and `y` do not need to be adjusted as they are part of the loop head but are not modified in the loop condition.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be at least 10, `m` must be at least 15, `x` is 2, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / 6` and `m // 3` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by `min(n / 8, m // 8)`.**
