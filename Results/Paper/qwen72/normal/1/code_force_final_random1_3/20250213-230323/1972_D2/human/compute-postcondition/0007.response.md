Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `func_1()` has been called `t` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `t` must have been sufficient to allow the loop to run the specified number of times, and the function `func_1()` has been called exactly `t` times.
