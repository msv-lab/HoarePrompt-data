Output State: **`x` is 4, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`, and `n` must be at least 16.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated to 1.
- The value of `x` remains 4.
- The value of `cnt` remains as the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
- The condition that `n` must be at least 16 remains unchanged.
