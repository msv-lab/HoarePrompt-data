The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `_` (the loop counter) is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1, and `func_1()` has been called twice. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than the current value of the loop counter.

Since the loop counter `_` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, after two iterations, the loop counter would be 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `func_1()` has been called twice.**
