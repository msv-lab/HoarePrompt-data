The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `y` was 3, so after the increment, `y` becomes 4. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. Since the gcd of `x` (which is 1) and the new value of `y` (which is 4) is still 1, the condition for calculating `cnt` remains the same as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `x` is 1, `y` is 4, and if the gcd of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is the minimum of `n / 3` and `m // 6` plus the minimum of `n / 4` and `m // 12`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains the minimum of `n / 3` and `m // 6`.**
