### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying a critical flaw in the program's handling of multiple test cases. Let's break down the issues and the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - This part of the function is correctly implemented according to the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the values of `n` and `m` directly from the input using `input().split()`.
   - However, this input reading is done inside `func_1`, which means it will only read the first pair of `n` and `m` and will not handle subsequent test cases.
   - This is a significant issue because the problem description clearly states that there are multiple test cases, and the input format includes the number of test cases `t`.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The input format specifies that the first line contains the number of test cases `t`.
   - Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m`.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not account for this structure, leading to incorrect behavior for multiple test cases.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To fix the issue, `func_1` should not read the input directly. Instead, it should take `n` and `m` as parameters.
   - The function `func_2` should read the input for each test case and pass `n` and `m` to `func_1`.

### Corrected Code:

```python
import math

# Function 1:
def func_1(n, m):
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    return cnt

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        results.append(func_1(n, m))
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program as initially written does not handle multiple test cases correctly, leading to incorrect behavior. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
