Output State: **`n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 3, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / 6` and `m // 3` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n / 6, m // 3)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
