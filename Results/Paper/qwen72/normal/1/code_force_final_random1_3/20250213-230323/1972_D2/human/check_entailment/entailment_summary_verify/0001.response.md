### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to solve one test case.
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Detailed Breakdown of `func_1`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `x` starts at 1.
     - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to count the valid pairs.
   - **Loop Over `x`:**
     - The loop runs while \(x \times x \le n\). This ensures that \(x\) does not exceed the square root of \(n\).
   - **Inner Loop Over `y`:**
     - For each `x`, `y` starts at 1 and increments until \((x + y) \times x \le n\) and \((x + y) \times y \le m\).
   - **GCD Check:**
     - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it means \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.
   - **Count Valid Pairs:**
     - The number of valid pairs is incremented by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \times x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \times y} \right\rfloor\).
   - **Print Result:**
     - After the loops, the count of valid pairs is printed.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - **Loop Conditions:**
     - The outer loop condition \(x \times x \le n\) ensures that \(x\) is within the range of \(\sqrt{n}\), which is a reasonable upper bound for checking pairs.
     - The inner loop conditions \((x + y) \times x \le n\) and \((x + y) \times y \le m\) ensure that the pairs \((a, b)\) are within the given ranges.
   - **GCD Check:**
     - The GCD check ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, which is necessary for the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - **Counting Logic:**
     - The counting logic is correct as it uses the minimum of the two bounds to ensure both conditions are satisfied.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - The algorithm handles edge cases where \(n\) and \(m\) are small (e.g., \(n = 1, m = 1\)) and large (e.g., \(n = 1000000, m = 1145141\)).
     - The use of integer division and floor functions ensures that the counts are accurate.

5. **Function Summary Verification:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The function does not return any value, and `t` remains unchanged after the function concludes.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly solves the problem as described. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
