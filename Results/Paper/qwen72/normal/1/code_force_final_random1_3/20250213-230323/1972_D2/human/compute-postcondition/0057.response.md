The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the given constraints, it is implied that the function might internally use or generate values for `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It is implied that the function might internally use or generate values for `n` and `m`, which are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. The specific output of the function is not provided.**
