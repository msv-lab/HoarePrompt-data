### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that `func_1` reads the values of `n` and `m` directly from the input without considering the number of test cases `t`.
   - The function `func_2` is responsible for handling multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case. This part of the program is correct.

2. **Input Handling in `func_1`:**
   - Inside `func_1`, the values of `n` and `m` are read using `input().split()`. This is correct for a single test case but not for multiple test cases.
   - The issue is that `func_1` should not read `n` and `m` directly; instead, these values should be passed as arguments to `func_1`.

3. **Algorithm Logic:**
   - The logic inside `func_1` is designed to find pairs `(a, b)` such that `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.
   - The loop structure and the condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` are correct for finding coprime pairs.
   - The calculation `cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is intended to count the valid pairs, but it needs to be verified if it correctly counts the pairs.

4. **Corrected Version:**
   - To fix the input handling, `func_1` should accept `n` and `m` as parameters.
   - `func_2` should pass `n` and `m` to `func_1` for each test case.

### Corrected Code:
```python
import math

def func_1(n, m):
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        func_1(n, m)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is correct in identifying the issue with input handling.
- The corrected version of the code addresses the input handling issue and should correctly solve the problem.

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the input handling issue.)
