To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is 4
   - `y` is 1
   - `cnt` is defined based on some complex calculation involving `n` and `m`
   - `n` must be at least 16

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute if both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

3. **Evaluate the Conditions:**
   - For the first condition: `(x + y) * x <= n`
     - Substituting the values: `(4 + 1) * 4 = 5 * 4 = 20`
     - We need `20 <= n`
   - For the second condition: `(x + y) * y <= m`
     - Substituting the values: `(4 + 1) * 1 = 5 * 1 = 5`
     - We need `5 <= m`

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - From the first condition, `n` must be at least 20 for the loop to execute.
   - From the second condition, `m` must be at least 5 for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
- The initial state has `n` as at least 16, but for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 20.
- The initial state does not specify a value for `m`, but `m` must be at least 5 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state to ensure the loop executes the first time is:

State: **`x` is 4, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`, `n` must be at least 20, and `m` must be at least 5**.
