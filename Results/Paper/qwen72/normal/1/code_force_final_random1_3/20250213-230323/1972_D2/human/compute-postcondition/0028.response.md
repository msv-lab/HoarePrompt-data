To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `x`
   - `y`
   - `n`
   - `m`

2. **Current State:**
   - `n` must be at least 6
   - `m` must be at least 3
   - `x` is 2
   - `y` is 2
   - `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / 6` and `m // 3` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

4. **Evaluate Current Conditions:**
   - For `x = 2` and `y = 2`:
     - `(x + y) * x = (2 + 2) * 2 = 8`
     - `(x + y) * y = (2 + 2) * 2 = 8`
   - Therefore, the conditions become:
     - `8 <= n`
     - `8 <= m`

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be at least 8 and `m` must be at least 8.

### Conclusion:
The only adjustments needed are to ensure that `n` and `m` meet the required conditions for the loop to execute again. Since `n` must be at least 6 and `m` must be at least 3, we need to update these to be at least 8.

State: **`n` must be at least 8, `m` must be at least 8, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / 6` and `m // 3` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.**
