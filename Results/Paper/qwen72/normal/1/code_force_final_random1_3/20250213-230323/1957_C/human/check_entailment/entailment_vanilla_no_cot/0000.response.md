Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The function `func_1` initializes the dynamic programming array `dp` with the base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. It then fills the array up to `n` using the recurrence relation:
   \[
   dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \cdot (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
   \]
   This recurrence relation is derived from the combinatorial problem of placing non-attacking rooks on a chessboard.

2. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.

3. **Invalid Positions**: The program maintains a set `invalid` to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks due to the initial moves. This ensures that these positions are not considered for further placements.

4. **Final Configuration Calculation**: For each test case, the program calculates the number of possible final configurations by looking up the precomputed value in the `dp` array, adjusted for the number of invalid positions:
   \[
   \text{result} = \max(1, dp[n - \text{len(invalid)}])
   \]
   This ensures that even if all positions are invalid, the result is at least 1 (which is a valid configuration).

5. **Modulo Operation**: The result is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) as required by the problem statement.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct and should handle the problem as specified.
