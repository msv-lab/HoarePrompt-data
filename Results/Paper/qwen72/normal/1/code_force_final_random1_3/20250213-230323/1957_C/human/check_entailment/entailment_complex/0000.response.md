Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Recursion Limit**: The program starts by setting the recursion limit to a high value to handle large inputs. This is necessary because the dynamic programming array (`dp`) is initialized up to a large value (300,000).

2. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized with `-1` values, indicating that the values have not been computed yet. The function `func_1` is called with the maximum possible value of `n` (300,000) to precompute the values of `dp`.

3. **Precomputation Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function initializes `dp[1]` to 1 and `dp[2]` to 3.
   - It then iterates from 3 to `n` and computes the value of `dp[i]` using the recurrence relation `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.
   - This recurrence relation correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on a board of size `i` without attacking each other, considering the mirrored moves.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and adds the rows and columns of these moves to the `invalid` set to keep track of positions that cannot be used.

5. **Final Configuration Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of valid configurations by subtracting the number of invalid rows and columns from `n` and looking up the precomputed value in the `dp` array.
   - The result is printed for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n - len(invalid)` is less than 1 by printing `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`, ensuring that the result is at least 1.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The dynamic programming approach is sound, and the input handling and final configuration calculation are appropriate.

Correctness: **True**
