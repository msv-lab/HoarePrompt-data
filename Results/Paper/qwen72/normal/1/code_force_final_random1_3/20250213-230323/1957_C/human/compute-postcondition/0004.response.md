The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` must be at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4, and `n` must still be at least 4.

State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 4, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7**
