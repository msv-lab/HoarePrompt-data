Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Recursion Limit**: The program starts by setting the recursion limit to 400,000, which is necessary because the dynamic programming (DP) table is initialized up to 300,000. This ensures that the program can handle large values of `n`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The DP table `dp` is initialized with `-1` for all indices from 0 to 300,000. This table will store the number of possible configurations for a given number of available rows/columns.

3. **Precomputation Function (`func_1`)**: The function `func_1` precomputes the DP values up to `n`. It initializes `dp[1]` to 1 and `dp[2]` to 3, which are the base cases. For each subsequent value of `i` from 3 to `n`, it computes `dp[i]` using the recurrence relation:
   \[
   dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
   \]
   This recurrence relation accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in a smaller board and then extend it to a larger board.

4. **Reading Test Cases**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

5. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It initializes a set `invalid` to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.
   - For each of the `k` moves, it adds the row and column indices to the `invalid` set.
   - Finally, it prints the number of possible configurations for the remaining valid rows/columns, which is `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

6. **Final Output**: The program correctly outputs the number of possible configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The dynamic programming approach and the handling of the constraints are appropriate.

Correctness: **True**
