Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an integer where 0 ≤ x ≤ 99, `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ 99, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, and `m` is `15 * (y + 1) // 2 - y * 4`. If `m` is less than `a`, then `z` is updated to `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`.***
