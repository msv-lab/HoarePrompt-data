Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`, which means `z` is the integer division of `y + 1` by 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `i`) retain their initial values or conditions.
