The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0, as it is the initial value for the range function.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
