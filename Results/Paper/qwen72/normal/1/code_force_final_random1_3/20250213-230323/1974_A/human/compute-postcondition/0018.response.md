The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This operation updates the values of `x` and `y` based on the new input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2` or `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` if `m` < `a`, and `m` is `15 * (y + 1) // 2 - y * 4`.**
