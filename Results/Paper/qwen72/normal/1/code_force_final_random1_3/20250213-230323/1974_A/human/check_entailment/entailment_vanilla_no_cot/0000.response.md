Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in how it calculates the number of screens required. Specifically, the variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`, which is intended to represent the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. However, this calculation is not correct because it does not properly account for the actual layout of the icons on the screens.

Additionally, the condition `if m < a:` is incorrect because `a` represents the number of test cases, not the number of 1x1 icons that need to be placed. The correct condition should check if the remaining space `m` is less than the number of 1x1 icons `x`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (y + 1) // 2
        # Calculate the remaining space on these screens
        remaining_space = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - y * 4
        # Calculate the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        if remaining_space < x:
            additional_screens = (x - remaining_space + 14) // 15
        else:
            additional_screens = 0
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens
        print(total_screens)
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the number of screens needed for both 2x2 and 1x1 icons, ensuring that the minimum number of screens is used.
