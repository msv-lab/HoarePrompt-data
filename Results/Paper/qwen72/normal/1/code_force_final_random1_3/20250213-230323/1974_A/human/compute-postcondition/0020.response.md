Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, and `m` is `15 * (y + 1) // 2 - y * 4`.**

Explanation: The code `m = 15 * z - y * 4` updates the value of `m` using the existing values of `z` and `y`. Since `z` is defined as `(y + 1) // 2`, the new value of `m` is calculated as `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
