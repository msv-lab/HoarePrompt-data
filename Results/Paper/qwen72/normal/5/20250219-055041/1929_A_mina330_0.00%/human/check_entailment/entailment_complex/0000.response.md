Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases (`ntest`) and then iterating over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`a`).

2. **Sorting**: The function sorts the array `a` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because the problem requires maximizing the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

3. **Calculation of Beauty**: The function calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array, moving inward from the ends. This is done by iterating from `0` to `len(a) // 2` and adding `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` to the result (`kq`). This approach ensures that the largest possible differences are used, which maximizes the beauty.

4. **Output**: The function prints the calculated beauty for each test case, which is the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For arrays with all identical elements (like `[69, 69, 69]`), the beauty will be `0` because the differences between all pairs will be `0`.
   - For arrays with distinct elements, the function correctly calculates the maximum possible beauty by using the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array.

6. **Constraints**: The function adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description, such as the range of `t`, `n`, and the values of `a_i`.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
