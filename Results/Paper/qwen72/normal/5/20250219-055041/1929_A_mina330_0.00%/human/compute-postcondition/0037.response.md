Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 5 elements, `i` is 2, `kq` is `kq + a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] + a[len(a) - 2] - a[1] + a[len(a) - 3] - a[2]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is a sorted list of integers provided by the user with at least 5 elements.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `kq` is updated to include the expression `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`, which simplifies to `a[len(a) - 3] - a[2]` since `i` is 2. Therefore, the new value of `kq` is `kq + a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] + a[len(a) - 2] - a[1] + a[len(a) - 3] - a[2]`.
