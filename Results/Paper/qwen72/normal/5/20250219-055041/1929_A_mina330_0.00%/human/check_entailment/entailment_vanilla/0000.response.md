### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this sum, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Approach**:
   - Sorting the array and then pairing the largest and smallest elements to maximize the differences is a good strategy.
   - By sorting the array, we can ensure that the differences between the largest and smallest elements are maximized.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case:
     - Read the length of the array \(n\).
     - Read the array elements and sort them.
     - Calculate the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements in pairs.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases \(ntest\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the array elements.
   - It sorts the array \(a\).
   - It initializes a variable \(kq\) to 0 to store the beauty.
   - It iterates over the first half of the sorted array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements in pairs.
   - Finally, it prints the calculated beauty.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where all elements are the same (e.g., the second test case with all 69s), correctly outputting 0.
   - The code handles the case where the array length is 2, correctly outputting the difference between the two elements.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The sorting step has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient for the given constraints \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and pairing the largest and smallest elements. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
