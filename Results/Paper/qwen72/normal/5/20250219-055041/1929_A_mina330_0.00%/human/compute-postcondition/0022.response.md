Output State: **`ntest` must be greater than 1, `itest` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 4 elements, `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] + a[len(a) - 2] - a[1]`, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `kq` is updated to `kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`.
- Since `i` is 1, `a[len(a) - i - 1]` is `a[len(a) - 2]` (the second-to-last element of the list `a`), and `a[i]` is `a[1]` (the second element of the list `a`).
- Therefore, `kq` becomes `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] + a[len(a) - 2] - a[1]`.
- The values of `ntest`, `itest`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
