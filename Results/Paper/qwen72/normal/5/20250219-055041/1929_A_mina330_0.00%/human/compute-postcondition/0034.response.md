To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `i`: This is the loop variable.
   - `a`: This is the list of integers.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(a) // 2`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `kq` is `kq + a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be 1 (because the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration).
   - The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `len(a) // 2`. Therefore, `len(a) // 2` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - `i` is incremented to 1.
   - `len(a) // 2` must be greater than 1, which means `len(a)` must be at least 3 (since `len(a) // 2` is an integer division).

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 1, `kq` is `kq + a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`**
