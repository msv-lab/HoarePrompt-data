To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `k >= 1 << idx`.

- `k` is an integer greater than 0.
- `idx` is 0.

The expression `1 << idx` shifts the binary representation of 1 to the left by `idx` positions. When `idx` is 0, `1 << 0` equals 1. Therefore, the condition `k >= 1 << idx` simplifies to `k >= 1`.

Given that `k` is already an integer greater than 0, the condition `k >= 1` is satisfied. Thus, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, `idx` is 0**
