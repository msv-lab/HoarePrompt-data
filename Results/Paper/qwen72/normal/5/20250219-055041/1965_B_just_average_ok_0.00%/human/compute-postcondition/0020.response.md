Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, and the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\). `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]` creates a new list `nums` where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23.
- This means `nums` now contains the values [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., \(2^{23}\)].
- The previous state specified that `nums` was a list of integers where each element was \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, except the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) was removed, and the last element of `nums` was `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
- After executing the code, `nums` is now a complete list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), and the last element is \(2^{23}\).
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `_`, and `idx` remain unchanged.
