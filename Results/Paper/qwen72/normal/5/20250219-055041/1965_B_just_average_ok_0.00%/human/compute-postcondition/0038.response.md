The code snippet `nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]` reassigns the variable `nums` to a new list where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23. This means that the previous state of `nums` (which included additional elements and had an element removed) is no longer valid. The new `nums` list will have 24 elements, each being a power of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\), `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(k < 2^{\text{idx}} - 1\), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0.**
