To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `k >= 1 << idx`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, and the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\).
   - `idx` is 3.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute if `k >= 1 << idx`.
   - `1 << idx` is a bitwise left shift operation, which means `1 << 3` is \(2^3 = 8\).
   - Therefore, the loop condition simplifies to `k >= 8`.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `k` and `idx`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `k` must be greater than or equal to 8.
   - The current state of `idx` is 3, and if `k` is already greater than or equal to 8, no adjustment is needed for `idx`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - If `k` is already greater than or equal to 8, the loop can execute again.
   - If `k` is less than 8, the loop will not execute again, and no adjustment can be made to `k` or `idx` to change this condition based on the given constraints.

Since the task is to modify the program state so that the next iteration of the loop can proceed, and the current state of `idx` is 3, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 8.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` must be greater than or equal to 8, `_` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, and the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\), `idx` is 3**
