Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases, with 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The function then modifies a list `nums` that initially contains powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23. It adds three new elements to `nums`: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, where `idx` is the largest index such that 2^idx <= k. It removes the element 2^idx from `nums`. Finally, it prints the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of the list for each test case. The function does not return any value. **
