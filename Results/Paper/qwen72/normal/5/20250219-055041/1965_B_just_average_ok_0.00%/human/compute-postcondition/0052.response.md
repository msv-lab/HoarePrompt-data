Let's break down the initial state and the transformations applied to the list `nums` step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, excluding \(2^{\text{idx}}\).
   - The last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\).
   - `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx} + 1} > k\).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `k` is an input integer greater than 0.

2. **Transformations:**
   - `nums` now includes an additional element `k - nums[idx]`.
   - `nums` includes another additional element `k + 1` at the end.
   - `nums` includes one more additional element `k + nums[idx] + 1` at the end.

3. **Calculating the Length of `nums`:**
   - Initially, `nums` contains 24 elements (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), excluding \(2^{\text{idx}}\)).
   - After the transformations, three additional elements are added to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]`
     - `k + 1`
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`
   - Therefore, the total number of elements in `nums` is \(24 - 1 + 3 = 26\).

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(len(nums))` statement will print the length of the list `nums` after all transformations.

Output: **26**
