Let's break down the initial state and the operations performed on the `nums` list step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `k` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1 (this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23. Therefore, `nums` initially contains the elements: \([2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \ldots, 2^{23}]\).

2. **Determine `idx`:**
   - `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(k < 2^{\text{idx}} - 1\).
   - This means \(k < 2^{\text{idx}} - 1\), which implies \(k + 1 < 2^{\text{idx}}\).
   - Therefore, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} > k + 1\).

3. **Modify `nums`:**
   - Add an additional element at the end of `nums` which is \(k - \text{nums}[\text{idx}]\).
   - Add another additional element at the end of `nums` which is \(k + 1\).
   - Add a third additional element at the end of `nums` which is \(k + \text{nums}[\text{idx}] + 1\).
   - Remove the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from `nums`.

4. **Calculate the length of `nums`:**
   - Initially, `nums` has 24 elements (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\)).
   - We add 3 elements to `nums`: \(k - \text{nums}[\text{idx}]\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + \text{nums}[\text{idx}] + 1\).
   - We remove 1 element from `nums`: \(2^{\text{idx}}\).
   - Therefore, the net change in the length of `nums` is \(24 + 3 - 1 = 26\).

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(len(nums))` statement will print the length of the modified `nums` list, which is 26.

Output: **26**
