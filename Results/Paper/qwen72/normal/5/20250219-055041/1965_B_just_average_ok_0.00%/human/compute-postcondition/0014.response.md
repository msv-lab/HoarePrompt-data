Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, and the last element of `nums` is `k + 1`, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1, and the new last element of `nums` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)` appends a new element to the list `nums`.
- The new element is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
- The previous state of `nums` had its last element as `k + 1`.
- The new last element of `nums` is now `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `int(input())`, `_`, `n`, `k`, and `idx`) remain unchanged.
