Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\), `idx` is 4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` must be greater than or equal to 8.**

The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
