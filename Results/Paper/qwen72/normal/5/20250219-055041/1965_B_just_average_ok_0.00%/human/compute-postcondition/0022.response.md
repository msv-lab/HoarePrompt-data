The only variables in the loop head are `k` and `idx`. The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`. For the loop to execute the first time, this condition must be true when `idx` is 0.

- `k` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `idx` is 0.

When `idx` is 0, `1 << idx` is `1 << 0`, which is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1. Since `k` is already specified to be greater than 0, the condition `k >= 1` is already satisfied.

No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, and the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\), `idx` is 0**
