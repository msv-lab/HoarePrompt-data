Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\), `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0.**

In natural language, after the loop has finished executing, the variable `idx` will be the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is greater than `k`. This means that the loop will increment `idx` until \(2^{\text{idx}}\) exceeds the value of `k`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `nums`, `n`, and `k`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.
