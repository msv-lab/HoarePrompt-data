Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, and the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\), `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(k < 2^{\text{idx}} - 1\).**

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is decremented by 1.
- The initial state of `idx` was the smallest integer such that \(k < 2^{\text{idx}}\).
- After decrementing, `idx` is now the smallest integer such that \(k < 2^{\text{idx}} - 1\).
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `_`, `nums`) remain unchanged.
