The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if the result of `int(input())` is greater than the current value of `_`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0
- `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, except the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) has been removed, and the last element of `nums` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`
- `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `_` needs to be incremented by 1, so `_` is now 1
- `int(input())` must still be greater than 0, and since `_` is now 1, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, except the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) has been removed, and the last element of `nums` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1**
