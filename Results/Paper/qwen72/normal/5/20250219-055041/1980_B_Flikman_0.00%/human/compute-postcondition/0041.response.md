Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new user input, `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in the new list `a`, `same_value_count` is the number of times the `favorite_value` appears in the new list `a`, and `greater_count` is the number of elements in the new list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`. If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `greater_count` is at least `k`. Otherwise, if `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, then the sum of `greater_count` and `same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`. If `greater_count + same_value_count` is greater than `k`, then the sum of `greater_count` and `same_value_count` is greater than `k`.**
