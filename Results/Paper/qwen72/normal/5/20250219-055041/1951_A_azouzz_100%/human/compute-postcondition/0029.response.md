The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`, and `_`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Output: **NO**
