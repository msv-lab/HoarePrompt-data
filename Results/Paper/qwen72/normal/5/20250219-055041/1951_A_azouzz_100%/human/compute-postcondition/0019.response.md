Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `cnt1` is 1, then `cnt1` is 1, which is less than or equal to 2 and odd. If `cnt1` is not 1, then `cnt1` is either less than or equal to 2, or `cnt1` is odd, and `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2. Additionally, if `s` contains the substring '11', the condition for `cnt1` remains unchanged. If `s` does not contain the substring '11', the condition for `cnt1` also remains unchanged.***
