Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `s`. It then counts the number of '1's in `s` and prints 'YES' if the count is greater than 2 and even, or if the count is less than or equal to 2 and does not contain '11'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify any external state or return any values. **
