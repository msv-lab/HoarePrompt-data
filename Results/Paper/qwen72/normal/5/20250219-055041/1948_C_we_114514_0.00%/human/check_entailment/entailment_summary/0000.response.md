Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and checking if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1). However, there are a few issues with the logic in the `func_1` function:

1. **Initialization of `reachable_second_row`**:
   - The variable `reachable_second_row` is initialized to `False`. This is correct because the robot starts in the first row and cannot initially be in the second row.

2. **Loop through the grid**:
   - The loop iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`), the robot can move to the next column.
     - If the arrow points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`), the robot cannot move to the next column, and it checks if the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`). If it does, the robot can move to the second row.
   - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), the robot can move to the next column.
     - However, the logic does not correctly handle the transition from the second row back to the first row or the continuation in the second row.

3. **Final Check**:
   - The program checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by verifying if `reachable_second_row` is `True` after the loop. This is incorrect because the robot might be in the first row at the last column, and it should also check if the last column in the first row points to the right.

4. **Missing Transitions**:
   - The program does not handle the transition from the second row back to the first row correctly. It should check if the robot can move from the second row to the first row when the arrow in the second row points to the left and the arrow in the first row points to the right.

5. **Incorrect Logic for `reachable_second_row`**:
   - The variable `reachable_second_row` is set to `True` only when the robot moves from the first row to the second row, but it should also be set to `True` if the robot can move from the second row to the first row and back to the second row.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
