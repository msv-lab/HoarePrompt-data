The only objects in the loop head are `test_case` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `test_cases` list. If the list has more than one test case, the loop will execute again with the next test case.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 1 test case
- `test_case` is the first test case in the list
- `results` is a list containing either the string 'YES' or 'NO'
- `n` is the first element of the first test case
- `row1` is the second element of the first test case
- `row2` is the third element of the first test case
- `reachable_first_row` is False if any character in `row1` is not '>', otherwise it remains True
- `reachable_second_row` is either True or False. If `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` contains 'YES'. If `reachable_second_row` is False, `results` contains 'NO'

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `test_cases` must have at least 2 test cases
- `test_case` will be the second test case in the list
- The values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2` will be updated to the corresponding elements of the second test case
- The values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` will be re-evaluated based on the new `row1` and `row2`
- The `results` list will remain as it is, but it will be appended with a new result in the next iteration

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing either the string 'YES' or 'NO', `n` is the first element of the second test case, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `reachable_first_row` is False if any character in the new `row1` is not '>', otherwise it remains True, `reachable_second_row` is either True or False. If `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` contains 'YES'. If `reachable_second_row` is False, `results` contains 'NO'.**
