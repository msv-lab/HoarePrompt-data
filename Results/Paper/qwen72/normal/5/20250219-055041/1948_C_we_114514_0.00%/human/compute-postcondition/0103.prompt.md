Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing either the string 'YES' or 'NO', `n` is the first element of the second test case, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if reachable_first_row:
        if row1[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_first_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        if row2[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing either the string 'YES' or 'NO', `n` is the first element of the second test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `j` is 0. If `reachable_second_row` is True and `j` is equal to `n - 1` and the character at index `j` in `row2` is '>', the program continues as expected. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains True or False as determined by the precondition, and the program continues with the same state as described in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing either the string 'YES' or 'NO', `n` is the first element of the second test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `j` is 1. If `reachable_second_row` is True and `row2[j] == '>'` and `j == n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is True, and `reachable_first_row` retains its value as determined by the precondition. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` retain their values as determined by the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing either the string 'YES' or 'NO', `n` is the first element of the second test case and must be greater than 1, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `j` is 2, and `reachable_first_row` retains its value as determined by the precondition. If `reachable_second_row` is True, and `row2[j]` == '>', and `j` == `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` retains its value as determined by the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
