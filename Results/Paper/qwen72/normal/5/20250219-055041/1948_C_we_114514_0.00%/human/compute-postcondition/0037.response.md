The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` is 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be greater than 2, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is 2. If `reachable_second_row` is True and `row2[j]` is '>', and `j` is `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` remains True and `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `reachable_second_row` is True and `row2[j]` is not '>', both `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged. If `reachable_second_row` is False, both `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged.**
