You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that has been fully iterated over, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `test_cases`. For each test case, if the robot can move from the first row to the second row or stay in the second row until the end, `results` contains 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'NO'.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `test_cases`. Each 'YES' indicates that the robot can move from the first row to the second row or stay in the second row until the end, while each 'NO' indicates that the robot cannot do so.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing an even integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` with characters '<' and '>'. The function returns a list `results` where each element is 'YES' if the robot can move from the first row to the second row or stay in the second row until the end, and 'NO' if the robot cannot do so. After the function concludes, `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, and `results` contains the outcomes for all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two rows of arrows `row1` and `row2`.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, (row1, row2))` in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process each test case and determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.

3. **Initialization**:
   - The function initializes `reachable_first_row` to `True` and `reachable_second_row` to `False`.
   - This initialization makes sense because the robot starts at `(1, 1)` and can initially only be in the first row.

4. **Loop Through Columns**:
   - The function iterates through each column `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - It checks the current state of the robot and updates the reachability flags based on the direction of the arrows in the current column.

5. **First Row Check**:
   - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is at the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can move to the second row and potentially reach the target).
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
       - The robot can no longer stay in the first row, so `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.
       - If the robot is not at the last column (`j < n - 1`) and the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can move to the second row).

6. **Second Row Check**:
   - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is at the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can reach the target).

7. **Result Collection**:
   - After processing all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends 'YES' to the results list.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

8. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Issues:
- The logic for updating `reachable_second_row` in the first row check is incorrect. The robot should be able to move to the second row if the arrow in the first row points to the right and the arrow in the second row points to the right, regardless of the current column index.
- The logic for updating `reachable_first_row` in the second row check is missing. The robot should be able to move back to the first row if the arrow in the second row points to the left and the arrow in the first row points to the right.

### Corrected Logic:
- The robot can move to the second row from the first row if the arrow in the first row points to the right and the arrow in the second row points to the right.
- The robot can move back to the first row from the second row if the arrow in the second row points to the left and the arrow in the first row points to the right.
- The robot can reach the target if it is in the second row at the last column and the arrow points to the right.

### Corrected Program:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input().strip()
        row2 = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, (row1, row2)))
    results = func_1(t, test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        (n, (row1, row2)) = test_case
        reachable_first_row = True
        reachable_second_row = False
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                    elif row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
                        reachable_first_row = False
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        results.append('YES')
                        break
                if row2[j] == '<' and row1[j] == '>':
                    reachable_first_row = True
                    reachable_second_row = False
        if not results or results[-1] != 'YES':
            results.append('NO')
    return results
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical issues that prevent it from correctly determining if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.
- The corrected program addresses these issues and should correctly determine the reachability of the target cell.

Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect, but the corrected program is correct.)
