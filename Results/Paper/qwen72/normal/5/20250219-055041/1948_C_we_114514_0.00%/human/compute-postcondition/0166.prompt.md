You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple (n, row1, row2) where n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and row1 and row2 are strings of length n containing only the characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        n, (row1, row2) = test_case
        
        reachable_first_row = True
        
        reachable_second_row = False
        
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
        
        if reachable_second_row:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that has been fully iterated over, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `test_cases`. For each test case, if the robot can move from the first row to the second row or stay in the second row until the end, `results` contains 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'NO'.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `test_cases`. Each 'YES' indicates that the robot can move from the first row to the second row or stay in the second row until the end, while each 'NO' indicates that the robot cannot do so.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing an even integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` with characters '<' and '>'. The function returns a list `results` where each element is 'YES' if the robot can move from the first row to the second row or stay in the second row until the end, and 'NO' if the robot cannot do so.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `test_cases`. Each 'YES' indicates that the robot can move from the first row to the second row or stay in the second row until the end, while each 'NO' indicates that the robot cannot do so.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
