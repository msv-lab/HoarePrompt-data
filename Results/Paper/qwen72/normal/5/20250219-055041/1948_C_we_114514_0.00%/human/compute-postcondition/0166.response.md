Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing an even integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` with characters '<' and '>'. The function returns a list `results` where each element is 'YES' if the robot can move from the first row to the second row or stay in the second row until the end, and 'NO' if the robot cannot do so. After the function concludes, `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, and `results` contains the outcomes for all test cases. **
