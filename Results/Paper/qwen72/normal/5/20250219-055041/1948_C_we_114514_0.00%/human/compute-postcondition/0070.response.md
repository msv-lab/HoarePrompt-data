Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing either the string 'YES' or 'NO', `n` is the first element of the second test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `j` is 0, and `reachable_first_row` is True. If `row1[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` is equal to `n - 1`, otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains False. If `row1[j]` is not '>', then `reachable_first_row` is False, and `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` is less than `n - 1` and the character at index `j` in `row2` is '>', otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains False.***
