Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) with at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and 'NO'. If `reachable_second_row` is true, `results` also contains an additional 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains an additional 'NO'. `j` is `n - 1`, and `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged.***
