Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple (n, row1, row2) where n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and row1 and row2 are strings of length n containing only the characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**
