Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 4, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` is `list[3] - 2 * list[2]`, `list[4]` is `list[4] - 2 * list[3]`, `list[4]` must be greater than 1, `list[5]` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` is executed with `i` being 4.
- `list[4]` is updated to `list[4] - 2 * list[3]`.
- All other values and conditions remain unchanged.
