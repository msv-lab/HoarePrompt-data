### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The task is to determine if it's possible to make all elements of an array `a` zero using the specified operations.
   - The operation involves selecting an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) and decrementing `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1, respectively.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(list, n)`**:
     - This function checks if all elements in the list `list` from index 0 to `n-1` are zero.
     - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
     - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

   - **`func_2(list, n)`**:
     - This function attempts to make all elements of the list zero by applying the specified operation.
     - It iterates through the list from index 1 to `n-2` (i.e., the middle elements of the list).
     - For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`. If so, it applies the operation.
     - If at any point `list[i-1]` becomes zero, it prints "no" and returns, indicating that it's impossible to make all elements zero.
     - After the loop, it calls `func_1(list, n)` to check if all elements are zero and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

3. **Logical Flaws:**
   - The operation in `func_2` is applied in a way that might not be optimal. The loop and the while condition inside it can lead to incorrect results.
   - Specifically, the line `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` and `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` and `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` are problematic because they decrement `list[i + 1]` and `list[i]` by the value of `list[i - 1]`, which can lead to negative values or incorrect decrements.
   - The correct approach should be to decrement `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1, respectively, in a single step.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program as written does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem.
   - The operation should decrement `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1, respectively, in a single step, not by the value of `list[i-1]`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the operation applied in `func_2` does not match the problem's requirements, and it can lead to incorrect results or negative values in the list. The correct implementation should decrement the elements by fixed values (1, 2, 1) in a single step.
