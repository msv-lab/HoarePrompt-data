Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (4 < n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 4, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` must be greater than 0, `list[4]` is `list[4] - 2 * list[3]` and must be greater than 1, `list[5]` is `list[5] - list[3] - 1 * list[3]` and must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` updates the value of `list[5]` by subtracting `list[3]` from it. Since `i` is 4, `i + 1` is 5, and `i - 1` is 3. The value of `list[5]` is now `list[5] - list[3] - 1 * list[3]`, which simplifies to `list[5] - 2 * list[3]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
