Correctness: **False**

The given program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The `while` loop in `func_2` is not correctly implementing the operation described in the problem. The operation should decrement `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively. However, the loop is decrementing `list[i + 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i - 1]` by `list[i - 1]`, which is incorrect.
   - The condition `list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0)` is not sufficient to ensure that the operation can be applied. The operation should be applied as long as `list[i] >= 2`, `list[i - 1] >= 1`, and `list[i + 1] >= 1`.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the array is already zero or where the array cannot be made zero due to the constraints of the operation. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3]`, it cannot be made zero because the operation would require `a_2` to be at least 2, but `a_1` and `a_3` would not be sufficient to support the operation.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints 'no' in the middle of the function, which is not part of the required output format. The output should only be 'YES' or 'NO'.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The program's approach is inefficient and may not work for large inputs. It should be optimized to check if the array can be made zero without performing the operations explicitly.

A correct approach would involve checking if the sum of the elements in the array is divisible by 4 and if the array can be balanced such that the operation can be applied to make all elements zero. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_zero(a, n):
    # Calculate the total sum of the array
    total_sum = sum(a)
    
    # If the total sum is not divisible by 4, it's impossible to make all elements zero
    if total_sum % 4 != 0:
        return False
    
    # Check if the array can be balanced
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if a[i] < 2 or a[i - 1] < 1 or a[i + 1] < 1:
            return False
        # Apply the operation as much as possible
        while a[i] >= 2 and a[i - 1] >= 1 and a[i + 1] >= 1:
            a[i - 1] -= 1
            a[i] -= 2
            a[i + 1] -= 1
    
    # Check if all elements are zero
    return all(x == 0 for x in a)

def solve(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, a in test_cases:
        if can_make_zero(a, n):
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    return results

# Example usage
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]),
    (5, [2, 4, 4, 5, 1]),
    (5, [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]),
    (6, [5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]),
    (4, [1, 2, 7, 2]),
    (3, [7, 1, 0]),
    (4, [1, 1, 1, 1])
]

results = solve(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version checks if the total sum of the array is divisible by 4 and then attempts to balance the array by applying the operation as much as possible. If the array can be balanced to all zeros, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
