Functionality: ** The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are odd integers between 3 and 99, inclusive. However, the function results in an error because it attempts to unpack the integer `a` into `x` and `y`, which is not valid. As a result, the function does not return any value. **
