Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string is already sorted. For example, when the input string is "0000", the program should output 0, as the string is already sorted and no operations are needed. However, the program will still go through the loop and potentially add to the cost, which is incorrect. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle cases where the string is a mix of '0's and '1's but is not in non-descending order, such as "101011". The logic in `func_1` does not ensure that the string is sorted in non-descending order with the minimum cost. For instance, the correct minimum cost for "101011" should be 5, but the program's logic might not produce this result.
