Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings. The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates this cost based on the number of '1's and the positions of '0's in the string. The logic in `func_1` is as follows:

1. Initialize `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
2. Iterate through each character in the string `s`:
   - If the character is '1', increment `one` by 1.
   - If the character is '0' and there has been at least one '1' encountered before it, increment `cost` by `one + 1`.
3. Return the total `cost`.

This logic works because:
- Each time a '0' is encountered after a '1', it implies that the '0' needs to be moved to the left of all the '1's encountered so far to sort the string.
- Moving a '0' to the left of all '1's encountered so far can be done by performing a cyclic shift on the substring that includes all these '1's and the '0'. The cost of such a shift is the length of this substring, which is `one + 1`.

The program correctly handles the input and output format, and the logic for calculating the cost is sound. The provided examples in the problem statement are also correctly solved by the program.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
