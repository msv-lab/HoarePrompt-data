Output State: **`s` is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}), `cost` is the total cost accumulated based on the loop logic, and `one` is the count of consecutive '1's at the end of the string.**

### Explanation:
- **`s`**: The binary string remains unchanged as the loop only reads the characters of `s` and does not modify it.
- **`cost`**: This variable accumulates the cost based on the loop logic. For each '0' encountered after a sequence of '1's, the cost is incremented by the number of consecutive '1's plus one.
- **`one`**: This variable keeps track of the number of consecutive '1's encountered. It is reset to 0 whenever a '0' is encountered and `one` is greater than 0.

After the loop has executed all iterations:
- **`cost`** will be the sum of all the increments that occurred when a '0' was encountered after a sequence of '1's.
- **`one`** will be the count of consecutive '1's at the end of the string, or 0 if the last character is '0' or if there are no consecutive '1's at the end.

This final state reflects the cumulative effect of the loop on the `cost` and `one` variables based on the characters in the string `s`.
