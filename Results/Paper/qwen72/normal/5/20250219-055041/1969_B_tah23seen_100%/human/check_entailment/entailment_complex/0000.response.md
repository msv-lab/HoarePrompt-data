Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on any chosen substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.

The provided function `func_1` works as follows:
- It initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
- It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
  - If the character is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
  - If the character is '0' and there have been '1's encountered before (i.e., `one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`. This is because a '0' encountered after a '1' indicates a potential need to shift the substring to move the '1' to the right of the '0', and the cost of such a shift is the length of the substring, which is `one + 1`.

This approach is correct because:
1. **Identifying the Cost of Cyclic Shifts**: The function correctly identifies the cost of each necessary cyclic shift by counting the number of '1's that need to be moved past a '0'. Each such shift involves moving all '1's to the right of the '0', which is why the cost is `one + 1`.
2. **Handling Already Sorted Strings**: If the string is already sorted (i.e., all '0's come before all '1's), the function will not encounter any '0' after a '1', and thus the `cost` will remain 0, which is correct.
3. **Efficiency**: The function runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the string, which is efficient given the constraints.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic:
- The function does not account for the case where the string starts with '0's and ends with '1's. In such cases, the optimal strategy might involve a cyclic shift of the entire string to move the trailing '1's to the beginning, which would be a single operation with a cost equal to the length of the string.

To address this, the function should also consider the cost of a single cyclic shift of the entire string if it starts with '0's and ends with '1's. This can be done by checking if the string has a '1' at the end and a '0' at the beginning, and if so, comparing the current `cost` with the length of the string.

Given this, the function as provided is **not** fully correct. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    
    # Check if the string starts with '0' and ends with '1'
    if s[0] == '0' and s[-1] == '1':
        cost = min(cost, len(s))
    
    return cost
```

With this correction, the function will handle all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **False** (The original function is incorrect due to the missing edge case handling.)
