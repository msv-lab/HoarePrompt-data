Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order and must have at least 1 element, `cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in `N`, and `num` is less than or equal to `cur`. The code snippet `M[cur] += 1` raises a `KeyError` because `cur` is -1 and `M` is an empty dictionary, so `M[cur]` does not exist.**

In natural language: The initial state remains unchanged, but the code snippet `M[cur] += 1` results in a `KeyError` because `cur` is -1 and `M` is an empty dictionary, so there is no key -1 in `M` to increment.
