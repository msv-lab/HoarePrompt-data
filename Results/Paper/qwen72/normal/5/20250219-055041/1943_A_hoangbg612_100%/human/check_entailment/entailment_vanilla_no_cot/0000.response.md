Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a few issues that prevent it from solving the problem correctly:

1. **Incorrect Handling of MEX Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX by maintaining a dictionary `M` that tracks the count of each number in the array. However, the logic for updating `cur` and breaking out of the loop is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if num > cur + 1:` is not the correct way to determine the MEX. Instead, the MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array `c`.

2. **Incorrect Final MEX Calculation**: The final MEX calculation logic is incorrect. The program checks if the sum of the counts in the dictionary `M` equals `S` (the size of the array `a`), and then increments `cur` by 1. This is not the correct way to determine the MEX. The MEX should be the smallest integer that is not in the array `c`.

3. **Handling of Single Occurrences**: The program tries to handle the case where there are single occurrences of numbers in the array `c` by checking the length of `cnt` and setting `cur` to `cnt[1]`. This logic is also flawed and does not correctly determine the MEX.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game and determine the MEX of the array `c` after all elements have been picked. Here's a correct approach:

1. **Sort the Array**: Sort the array `a` to facilitate the optimal picking strategy.
2. **Simulate the Game**: Simulate the game by alternating turns between Alice and Bob. Alice should always pick the smallest available element that maximizes the MEX, while Bob should pick the smallest available element that minimizes the MEX.
3. **Calculate MEX**: After the game ends, calculate the MEX of the array `c`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        
        c = []
        for i in range(S):
            if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
                c.append(N.pop(0))
            else:  # Bob's turn
                N.pop(0)
        
        # Calculate MEX of c
        mex = 0
        for num in c:
            if num == mex:
                mex += 1
            else:
                break
        
        print(mex)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Sorting the Array**: We sort the array `N` to ensure that both players can pick the smallest available element.
- **Simulating the Game**: We use a loop to simulate the game. Alice picks the smallest element on her turn, and Bob picks the smallest element on his turn.
- **Calculating MEX**: After the game ends, we calculate the MEX of the array `c` by iterating through the elements of `c` and checking the smallest non-negative integer that is not present.

This approach ensures that both players play optimally and the MEX is calculated correctly.
