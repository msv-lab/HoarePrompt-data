The only objects in the loop head are the variables `num` and the list `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N` and the variable `num`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element.
- `num` is the first element in `N`.
- If `num` > `cur`, `cur` is now equal to `num`.
- `M[num]` is 1.
- If `num` > `cur + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `num` ≤ `cur`, `M[cur]` is increased by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `N` must still be a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, and `num` must be the next element in `N` (i.e., the second element).

Since `num` is the first element in `N` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `num` will be the second element in `N`. The list `N` remains unchanged, but `num` is updated to the next element.

State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `num` is the second element in `N`. If `num` > `cur`, `cur` is now equal to `num`, `M[num]` is 1, and if `num` > `cur + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` ≤ `cur`, `M[cur]` is increased by 1.**
