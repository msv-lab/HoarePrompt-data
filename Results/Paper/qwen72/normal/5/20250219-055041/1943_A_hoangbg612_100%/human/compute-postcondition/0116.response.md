Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in `N`, and the current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, but the other conditions and variables remain unchanged. The list `N` is still a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `num` is still the first element in `N`, and `num` is still greater than `cur + 1` (although `cur` itself has increased by 1).
