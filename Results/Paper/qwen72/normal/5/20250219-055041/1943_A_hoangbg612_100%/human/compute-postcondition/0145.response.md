To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `k` and `M`. The loop will execute if `M` has at least one key. Based on the provided state, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1`, and the values are the counts of these integers in `N`.

Given the state:
- `N` is a sorted list of integers.
- `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution.
- `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` and the values are the counts of these integers in `N`.
- `cnt` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `M` must have at least one key. The state of `cur` and `N` should be such that `M` is not empty. Since `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1`, it implies that `cur` is the largest integer in `N` and `M` should contain `cur` as a key with a count of at least one.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `M` has at least one key, which is `cur`.

State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1`, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key (which is `cur`), and `cnt` is an empty list.**
