Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `cur` is the last element in `N` or the largest element in `N` that is not greater than `cur` + 1, `M` is a dictionary with keys being the elements in `N` that are not greater than `cur` + 1, and each key's value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that key in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks or ends. If the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, then `cur` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. `cnt` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for k in M.keys():
    if M[k] == 1:
        cnt.append(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `cur` is the last element in `N` or the largest element in `N` that is not greater than `cur` + 1, `M` is a dictionary with keys being the elements in `N` that are not greater than `cur` + 1, and each key's value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that key in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks or ends, `cnt` is a list containing the first key in `M` if `M[k]` is 1, otherwise `cnt` remains an empty list, `M` must have at least one key, and `k` is the first key in `M`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `cur` is the last element in `N` or the largest element in `N` that is not greater than `cur` + 1, `M` is a dictionary with keys being the elements in `N` that are not greater than `cur` + 1, and each key's value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that key in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks or ends, `M` must have at least two keys, `k` is the second key in `M`. If `M[k]` == 1, `cnt` is a list that now includes the value of `k`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `cur` is the last element in `N` or the largest element in `N` that is not greater than `cur` + 1, `M` is a dictionary with keys being the elements in `N` that are not greater than `cur` + 1, and each key's value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that key in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks or ends, `M` must have at least three keys, `k` is the third key in `M`. If `M[k]` == 1, `cnt` is a list that now includes the value of `k`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
