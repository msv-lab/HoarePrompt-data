Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order and must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `N`, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key. If `num` > `cur`, `M[cur]` is 1, and `cur` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is 1, and `cur` remains -1.***
