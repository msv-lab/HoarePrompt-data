Postcondition: ***`[*open(0)][1:]` is a list containing at least one element, `s` is the first element of this list, `n` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by spaces, and `k` is the integer value of the second part of `s` split by spaces. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` remains equal to `k` if they were originally equal, or `n` remains not equal to `k` if they were originally not equal. If `k` is less than 2, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.***
