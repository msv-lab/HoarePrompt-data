Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. `[*open(0)][1:]` is a list containing at least one element. This means that when the file descriptor `0` (which typically refers to standard input) is read, it is converted to a list and the first element is removed, leaving a list with at least one element.
2. `s` is the first element of this list. Since the list has at least one element, `s` is guaranteed to be defined.
3. `n` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by spaces. This means `s` is a string that contains at least one space, and `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space.
4. `k` is the integer value of the second part of `s` split by spaces. This means `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space.
5. `k` is greater than or equal to 2.
6. `n` is not equal to `k`.

Given the `print('-1')` statement, the output is simply the string `'-1'`.

The values of `s`, `n`, and `k` are not directly relevant to the output of the `print` statement, but they are part of the precondition. The `print` statement does not use these variables, so the output is independent of their values.

Output: **-1**
