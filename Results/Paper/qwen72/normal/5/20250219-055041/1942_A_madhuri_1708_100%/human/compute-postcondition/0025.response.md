Output State: **`[*open(0)][1:]` is an empty list, and the loop has processed all the lines from the input. For each line processed, `n` and `k` were updated to the integer values of the first and second parts of the line split by spaces, respectively. If `k` was greater than or equal to 2 and `n` was equal to `k`, the loop printed `k` repeated `k` times. If `k` was greater than or equal to 2 and `n` was not equal to `k`, the loop printed `-1`. If `k` was less than 2, the loop printed the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.**

In natural language: After the loop has finished executing all iterations, the list `[*open(0)][1:]` is empty, meaning all input lines have been processed. For each input line, the loop read `n` and `k` as integers. If `k` was 2 or greater, and `n` was equal to `k`, it printed `k` repeated `k` times. If `k` was 2 or greater, and `n` was not equal to `k`, it printed `-1`. If `k` was less than 2, it printed the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. The values of `n` and `k` are updated for each line, but they are not retained after the loop completes.
