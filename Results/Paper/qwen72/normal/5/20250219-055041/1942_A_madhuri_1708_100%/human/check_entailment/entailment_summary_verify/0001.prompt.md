You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads lines from the standard input, excluding the first line. For each subsequent line, it splits the line into two integers `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is equal to `k`, it prints `k` repeated `k` times. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is not equal to `k`, it prints `-1`. If `k` is less than 2, it prints the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. After processing all lines, the function concludes with no return value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input from standard input. The first line is skipped (presumably the number of test cases), and then each subsequent line is processed.
   - Each line is split into two integers `n` and `k`, representing the length of the array and the number of sorted cyclic shifts required.

2. **Conditions and Output:**
   - **Case 1: `k >= 2`**
     - **Sub-case 1: `n == k`**
       - If `n` is equal to `k`, the program prints an array of `n` elements, all of which are `k`.
       - This is correct because if `n == k`, all cyclic shifts of the array will be sorted. For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the array `[3, 3, 3]` will have all three cyclic shifts sorted.
     - **Sub-case 2: `n != k`**
       - If `n` is not equal to `k`, the program prints `-1`.
       - This is incorrect. The program should not print `-1` for all cases where `n != k`. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 3, 1]`, which has exactly two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.

3. **Case 2: `k < 2`**
   - If `k` is less than 2, the program prints an array of `n` elements, where each element is `j + 1` for `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.
   - This is correct because if `k = 1`, the array should have exactly one sorted cyclic shift. The array `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is itself.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not handle the case where `k >= 2` and `n != k` properly. It incorrectly prints `-1` for all such cases, even though there can be valid arrays that satisfy the conditions.

### Correctness: **False**
