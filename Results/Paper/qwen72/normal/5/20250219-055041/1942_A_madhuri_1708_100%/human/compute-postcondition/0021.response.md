Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. `[*open(0)][1:]` is a list containing at least three elements.
   - This means that the list is created by reading the contents of file descriptor 0 (which is typically standard input), converting it to a list, and slicing it to exclude the first element. The resulting list has at least three elements.
   
2. `s` is the third element of this list.
   - This means `s` is the element at index 2 of the list `[*open(0)][1:]`.

3. `n` and `k` are the integer values of the first and second parts of `s` split by spaces, respectively.
   - This means that `s` is a string that contains at least two parts separated by a space. When `s` is split by spaces, the first part is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`, and the second part is converted to an integer and assigned to `k`.

Now, let's look at the code snippet:
```
print('-1')
```
- This code snippet simply prints the string `'-1'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state, the output will be the same regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, or `k`.

Output: **-1**
