#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def solve(n, k):`, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])
        
    #State: `[*open(0)][1:]` is an empty list, and the loop has processed all the lines from the input. For each line processed, `n` and `k` were updated to the integer values of the first and second parts of the line split by spaces, respectively. If `k` was greater than or equal to 2 and `n` was equal to `k`, the loop printed `k` repeated `k` times. If `k` was greater than or equal to 2 and `n` was not equal to `k`, the loop printed `-1`. If `k` was less than 2, the loop printed the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads lines from the standard input, excluding the first line. For each subsequent line, it splits the line into two integers `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is equal to `k`, it prints `k` repeated `k` times. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is not equal to `k`, it prints `-1`. If `k` is less than 2, it prints the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. After processing all lines, the function concludes with no return value.
