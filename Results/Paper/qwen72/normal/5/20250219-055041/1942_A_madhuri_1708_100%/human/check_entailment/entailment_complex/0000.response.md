### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads input from the standard input, which is appropriate for the problem.
   - It processes each line of input starting from the second line, which is correct as the first line contains the number of test cases.

2. **Logic for Different Cases:**
   - **Case 1: `k >= 2` and `n == k`**
     - The function prints `k` repeated `k` times. This is correct because if `n == k`, the array can be `[k, k, ..., k]` (with `k` elements), and all cyclic shifts of this array will be sorted.
   - **Case 2: `k >= 2` and `n != k`**
     - The function prints `-1`. This is incorrect. The problem does not state that if `k >= 2` and `n != k`, the only solution is `-1`. There can be valid arrays that satisfy the conditions. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the array `[1, 2, 1]` has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2]`.
   - **Case 3: `k < 2`**
     - The function prints the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. This is correct because if `k == 1`, the array can be `[1, 2, ..., n]`, and only the original array will be sorted. If `k == 0`, the function should print `-1` because it's impossible to have 0 sorted cyclic shifts.

3. **Overall Function Behavior:**
   - The function processes each test case correctly for `k < 2`.
   - However, for `k >= 2` and `n != k`, the function incorrectly prints `-1` instead of attempting to find a valid array.

### Conclusion:
The function is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `k >= 2` and `n != k` properly. It should attempt to find a valid array in this case instead of always printing `-1`.

### Correctness:
**False**
