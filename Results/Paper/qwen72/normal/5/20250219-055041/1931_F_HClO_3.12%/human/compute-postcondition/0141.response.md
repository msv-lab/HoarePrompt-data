Output State: **`a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` must be greater than 1, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or one of them is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and the other is set to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple containing the first integer and the list of the remaining integers from each new input, `_` is `m - 2`, and all inputs have been consumed.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variables `a2`, `l2`, `a1`, `l1`, `t`, `n`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged from their initial values.
- The variable `m` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop runs at least once.
- The variable `_` is incremented to `m - 2`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations.
- All inputs have been consumed by the loop, meaning the loop has processed `m - 2` new inputs.
