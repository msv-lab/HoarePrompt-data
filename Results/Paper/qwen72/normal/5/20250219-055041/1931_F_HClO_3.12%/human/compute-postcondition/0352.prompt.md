Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, and `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`. If `idx1` < `idx2`, `l` is equal to `l2` and `a2` has been inserted into `l2` at the second-to-last position. If `idx1` > `idx2`, `a1` has been inserted into `l1` at the second-to-last position and `l` is equal to `l1`. If `idx1` == `idx2`, `a3` is the first integer input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers input, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, and `m` is decreased by 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `_` is incremented by 1, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)`, `(a3, l3)`, and `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining input, `_` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
