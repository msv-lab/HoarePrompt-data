Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input, `a1` is the first integer from the previous new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the previous new input, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the previous new input, `m` is at least 3, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is the index where `l1[i + p1]` first equals `a2` or -1 if no such index exists, `idx2` is the index where `l2[i + p2]` first equals `a1` or -1 if no such index exists, `p1` is 1 if `l1` contains an element equal to `a2` before `l2` contains an element equal to `a1`, otherwise `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1 if `l2` contains an element equal to `a1` before `l1` contains an element equal to `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)`, `_` is `m - 2`, all inputs have been consumed.**

Explanation:
- The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a new line of input and splits it into integers. The first integer is assigned to `a3`, and the remaining integers are assigned to `l3`.
- This new input does not affect the values of `a2`, `l2`, `a1`, `l1`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, or `_`.
- The values of `a3` and `l3` are updated based on the new input, but all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
