The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `m`. If `m - 2` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` must be greater than 2, `_` is 0, and `t` must be greater than 0.

At the start of the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1, so `_` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `m - 2` must still be greater than 0, which means `m` must be greater than 3.

State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, and the program waits for user input.**
