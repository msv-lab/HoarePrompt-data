Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or one of them is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and the other is set to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1, `val` is an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `_` is `m - 3`, `a3` is the first integer from the new new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new new input.**
