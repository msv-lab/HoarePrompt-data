Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, and the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`. The elements at the positions `i + p1` in `l1` and `i + p2` in `l2` are not equal. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is 0, `p1` is 1, and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, then `idx2` is 0, `p2` is 1, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`. Additionally, if `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
