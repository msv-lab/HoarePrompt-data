Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `idx2` is `i + 1`, and if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `idx2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`.
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, `idx2` is also assigned the value `i + 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
