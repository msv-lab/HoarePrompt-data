Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0. The sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`. The elements at the positions `i + p1` in `l1` and `i + p2` in `l2` are not equal. Additionally, the element at position `i + p1` in `l1` is equal to `a2`, and the element at position `i + p2` in `l2` is equal to `a1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
