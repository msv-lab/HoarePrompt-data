Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx1` is set to 2 and `p1` is set to 1. If `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution without any changes to `n` or `i`. If `l1[i + p1] != a2`, `idx2` is set to 2 and `p2` is set to 1.***
