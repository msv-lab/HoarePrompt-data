t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and cases is a list of t tuples, each containing two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5) followed by k lists of n integers each (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n, all a_{ij} are different), representing the order of participants as seen by the participant a_{i0}.
