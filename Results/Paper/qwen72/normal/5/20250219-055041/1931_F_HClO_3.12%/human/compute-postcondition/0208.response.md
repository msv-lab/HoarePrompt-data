Output State: **`a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is the index where `l1[i + p1]` first equals `a2` or -1 if no such index exists, `idx2` is the index where `l2[i + p2]` first equals `a1` or -1 if no such index exists, `p1` is 1 if `l1` contains an element equal to `a2` before `l2` contains an element equal to `a1`, otherwise `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1 if `l2` contains an element equal to `a1` before `l1` contains an element equal to `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list, `_` is 0, and all inputs have been consumed. Additionally, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, and `m` is equal to 2.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the loop continues. The specific value of `_` is updated to 0 because `m` is 2, and the expression `m - 2` evaluates to 0. All other conditions and values remain as they were in the initial state.
