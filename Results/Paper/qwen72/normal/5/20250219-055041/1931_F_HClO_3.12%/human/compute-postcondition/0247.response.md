Output State: **`val` is a list containing at least `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`, if any `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the loop breaks and prints 'no', otherwise, the loop completes and prints 'yes', `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2` remain unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input split by space and converted to integers.**
