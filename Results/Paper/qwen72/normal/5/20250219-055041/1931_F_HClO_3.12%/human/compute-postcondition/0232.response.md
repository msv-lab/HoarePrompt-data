To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case are `a3` and `l3`. The loop will execute if `val` is a non-empty list. Therefore, we need to ensure that `val` contains at least one tuple of the form `(a3, l3)`.

Given the initial state:
- `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`.
- `m` is at least 3.

For the loop to execute, `val` must have at least one tuple. Since `m` is at least 3, `m - 2` must be at least 1. Therefore, `val` must contain at least one tuple.

The state of `a3` and `l3` will be set by the first tuple in `val` when the loop starts. So, we need to ensure that `val` is non-empty and that `a3` and `l3` are set to the values of the first tuple in `val`.

State: **`val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of the form `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input, `a1` is the first integer from the previous new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the previous new input, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the previous new input, `m` is at least 3, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is the index where `l1[i + p1]` first equals `a2` or -1 if no such index exists, `idx2` is the index where `l2[i + p2]` first equals `a1` or -1 if no such index exists, `p1` is 1 if `l1` contains an element equal to `a2` before `l2` contains an element equal to `a1`, otherwise `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1 if `l2` contains an element equal to `a1` before `l1` contains an element equal to `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 0, `_` is 0, all inputs have been consumed.**

Simplified State: **`val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of the form `(a3, l3)`, `a3` and `l3` are set to the values of the first tuple in `val`**.
