Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `_` is `m - 3`, `t` must be greater than `m - 3`, and the program has received user input `m - 2` times.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs `m - 2` times, so after all iterations, the variable `_` will be equal to `m - 3` (since `_` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time).
- For the loop to execute all `m - 2` times, `m` must be greater than 2.
- The variable `t` must be greater than the final value of `_`, which is `m - 3`.
- The program will have received user input `m - 2` times, as the loop body includes an `input()` call that is executed `m - 2` times.
