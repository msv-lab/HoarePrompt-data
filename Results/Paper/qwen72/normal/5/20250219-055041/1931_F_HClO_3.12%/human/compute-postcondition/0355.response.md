Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `p1` is 0.
   - `p2` is 0.
   - `idx1` is -1.
   - `idx2` is -1.
   - `val` must contain at least 1 tuple.
   - `a3` is the integer from the first tuple in `val`.
   - `l3` is the list of integers from the first tuple in `val`.
   - `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`.
   - `m` must be greater than 2.
   - The list `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding the integer `a3`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('no')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
   - The string `'no'` is a constant and will be printed as is.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the string `'no'`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **no**
