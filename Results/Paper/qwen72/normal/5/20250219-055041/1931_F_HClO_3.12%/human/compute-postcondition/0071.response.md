Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, and `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx1` is `i + 1` and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is `i + 1` and `p2` is 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
