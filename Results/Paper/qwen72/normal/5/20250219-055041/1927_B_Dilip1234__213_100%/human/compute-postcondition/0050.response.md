The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range which is fixed at 26, so we can only adjust `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than 26. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' followed by the characters that were added during the loop execution.**
