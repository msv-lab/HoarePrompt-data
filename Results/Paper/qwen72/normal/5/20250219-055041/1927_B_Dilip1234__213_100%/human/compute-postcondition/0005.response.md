Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `char_count[j]` is equal to the value of `a[i]`, and `s` is the string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` + 97.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- The values of `i` and `j` remain 0.
- The value of `char_count[j]` is still equal to the value of `a[i]`.
- The variable `s` is updated to include the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` + 97. Since `j` is 0, `s` will contain the character 'a'.
