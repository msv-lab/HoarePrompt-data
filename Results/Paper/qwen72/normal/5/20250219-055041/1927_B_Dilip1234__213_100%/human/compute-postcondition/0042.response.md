Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza', `char_count[j]` is the value of `a[i]` + 1.**

The value of `char_count[j]` is incremented by 1, where `j` is 0 and `a[i]` is the value of the character at index 2 of the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
