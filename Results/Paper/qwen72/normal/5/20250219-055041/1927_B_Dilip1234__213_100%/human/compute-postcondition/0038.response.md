To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 25.
- `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' followed by the characters that were added during the loop execution.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

### Adjustments:
- **`i`**: At the start of the next iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1. So, `i` will be 2.
- **`n`**: `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified in the loop head.

### Conclusion:
The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`. The other variables (`n`, `j`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `i` is 2, `j` is 25, and `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' followed by the characters that were added during the loop execution.**
