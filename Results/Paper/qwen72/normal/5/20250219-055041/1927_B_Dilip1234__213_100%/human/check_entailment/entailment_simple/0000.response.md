### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers.
   - The input handling is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `n` and `a` as arguments.
   - Inside `func_1`, a string `s` is initialized to an empty string, and a list `char_count` of 26 zeros is created. This list will keep track of the count of each character from 'a' to 'z'.

3. **Loop through the Trace**:
   - The program iterates over each element in the list `a` using a loop with index `i`.
   - For each `a[i]`, it searches for a character in the range 'a' to 'z' (represented by indices 0 to 25) whose count in `char_count` matches `a[i]`.
   - When a match is found, the corresponding character is appended to `s`, and the count for that character is incremented in `char_count`.

4. **Character Selection**:
   - The program ensures that the character selected has the correct count as specified by `a[i]`.
   - The use of `chr(j + ord('a'))` correctly converts the index `j` to the corresponding lowercase Latin letter.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in `a`, the function returns the constructed string `s`.
   - The string `s` is guaranteed to be valid because the problem statement ensures that a valid string exists for the given trace.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 (e.g., `a = [0]`), correctly outputting a single character string.
   - The program also handles cases where `a` contains all zeros (e.g., `a = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`), correctly outputting a string of the same character repeated `n` times.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs a string `s` from the given trace `a` for each test case. The logic and implementation are sound, and the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
