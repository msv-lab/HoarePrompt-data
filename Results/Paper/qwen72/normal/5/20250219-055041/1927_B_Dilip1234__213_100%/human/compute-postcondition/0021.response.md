The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and the range `26`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range `26`. Since `26` is a constant and always greater than 0, the loop will always execute regardless of the initial value of `j`. However, for the loop to start correctly, `j` should be initialized to 0, as the `range(26)` will generate values from 0 to 25.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**
