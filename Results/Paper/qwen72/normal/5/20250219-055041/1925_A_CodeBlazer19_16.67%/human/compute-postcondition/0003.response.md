Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is an empty string.** 

The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers within the range 1 to 26, `t` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. The code snippet initializes an empty string `s`. Therefore, the only change is that `s` is now an empty string, while all other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
