The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `k`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `k + 97`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 98, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 99, and `k` must still satisfy the condition 1 <= `k` <= 26.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the string 'ab', `j` is 99**
