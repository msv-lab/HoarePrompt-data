Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed, `i` is `t` - 1, `s` is a string containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet, `j` is `k` + 96. If `k` is 1, `k` remains 1. Otherwise, `k` is greater than 1.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `n` and `k` will still be positive integers within the specified range (1 to 26). The variable `t` will be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations that were executed. The loop index `i` will be `t` - 1, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration. The variable `s` will be a string containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet, and the variable `j` will be `k` + 96, which is the last character's ASCII value used in the construction of `s`. If `k` is 1, the string `s` will be 'a' and `k` will remain 1. Otherwise, `s` will contain the first `k` letters of the alphabet, and `k` will be greater than 1.
