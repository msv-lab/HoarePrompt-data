Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 'a', `j` is 97, `k` must be at least 1**

Explanation: The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. Since `j` is 97, which corresponds to the character 'a', the string `s` is now 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged.
