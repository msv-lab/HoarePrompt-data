You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` should actually be defined with parameters `n, a, b, c` where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.

    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is `t-1` (initial `t` minus the number of iterations), `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last input strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`. If `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, the loop prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the loop prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It then checks if the string `c` can be a valid transformation of `a` and `b` based on a specific template. The template is constructed such that for each position `i` in `a` and `b`, if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, the template at position `i` is `a[i]`. Otherwise, the template at position `i` is the uppercase version of `a[i]`. The function prints 'YES' if `c` matches the template in a way that all lowercase characters in the template are the same as in `c`, and all uppercase characters in the template do not match the corresponding characters in `c` when converted to lowercase. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, and the last values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` being those of the final test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Construction:**
   - The function constructs a template `t` by iterating through each character of the strings `a` and `b`.
   - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, it appends `a[i]` to the template as a lowercase letter.
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, it appends `a[i]` to the template as an uppercase letter.

3. **Matching Strings `a` and `b` to the Template:**
   - The function checks if `a` and `b` match the template.
   - For each character in the template:
     - If the character is lowercase, it ensures that the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are the same as the template character.
     - If the character is uppercase, it ensures that the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   - If any condition fails, it sets `match_a_b` to `False`.

4. **Matching String `c` to the Template:**
   - The function checks if `c` does not match the template.
   - For each character in the template:
     - If the character is lowercase, it ensures that the corresponding character in `c` is different from the template character.
     - If the character is uppercase, it ensures that the corresponding character in `c` is the same as the lowercase version of the template character.
   - If any condition fails, it sets `match_c` to `False`.

5. **Output:**
   - If `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Template Construction:**
  - The template construction logic is correct. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template should have the same lowercase letter. If they are different, the template should have an uppercase letter to ensure that both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from the lowercase version of the template character.

- **Matching Logic:**
  - The matching logic for `a` and `b` is correct. It ensures that the conditions for matching are met.
  - The matching logic for `c` is incorrect. The function should ensure that `c` does not match the template, but the current logic is checking if `c` matches the template in the same way as `a` and `b`.

### Corrected Matching Logic for `c`:
- For `c` to not match the template:
  - If the template character is lowercase, `c[i]` should be different from the template character.
  - If the template character is uppercase, `c[i]` should be the same as the lowercase version of the template character.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        match_c = False
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] == template[i]:
                    match_c = True
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = True
                break
        if match_a_b and (not match_c):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error in the matching logic for `c`. The corrected program ensures that `c` does not match the template, which is the correct behavior according to the problem description.
