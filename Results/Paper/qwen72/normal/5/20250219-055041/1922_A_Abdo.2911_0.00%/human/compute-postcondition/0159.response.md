The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 2, `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`. If `template[i]` is a lowercase character and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_c` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `template[i]` is not a lowercase character and `c[i].lower()` is not equal to `template[i].lower()`, `match_c` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_c` retains its previous value.**
