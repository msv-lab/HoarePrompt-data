To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables `i` and `n` in the loop head. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop iterator and will be set to 0 at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace
- `b` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace
- `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace
- `i` is `n-1`
- `template` is an empty list
- `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True`

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will be set to 0 by the loop itself, so we don't need to adjust `i` explicitly. However, the initial state provided has `i` set to `n-1`, which is not relevant to the loop head and should not be included in the adjusted state.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
