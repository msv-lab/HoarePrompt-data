Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It then checks if the string `c` can be a valid transformation of `a` and `b` based on a specific template. The template is constructed such that for each position `i` in `a` and `b`, if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, the template at position `i` is `a[i]`. Otherwise, the template at position `i` is the uppercase version of `a[i]`. The function prints 'YES' if `c` matches the template in a way that all lowercase characters in the template are the same as in `c`, and all uppercase characters in the template do not match the corresponding characters in `c` when converted to lowercase. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, and the last values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` being those of the final test case. **
