Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`, `match_a_b` is `False` if any of the conditions are met, otherwise `True`, and `match_c` is `True` if none of the conditions in the loop body were met for any index `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`. If any of the conditions in the loop body were met for any index `i`, `match_c` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. Additionally, either `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True`.**
