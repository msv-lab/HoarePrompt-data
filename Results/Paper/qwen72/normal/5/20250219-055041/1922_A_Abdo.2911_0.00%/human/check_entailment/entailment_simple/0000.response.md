### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Construction:**
   - The program constructs a template `template` by iterating through each character of the strings `a` and `b`.
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, it appends the lowercase character to `template`.
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are different, it appends the uppercase version of the character from `a` to `template`.

3. **Matching Conditions:**
   - The program checks if strings `a` and `b` match the template `template`:
     - If the template character is lowercase, it ensures that the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are the same as the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it ensures that the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   - The program then checks if string `c` does not match the template `template`:
     - If the template character is lowercase, it ensures that the corresponding character in `c` is the same as the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it ensures that the corresponding character in `c` is different from the lowercase version of the template character.

4. **Output:**
   - If both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, the program prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues:
- **Template Construction:**
  - The template construction logic is flawed. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the program appends the uppercase version of `a[i]` to the template. However, this does not guarantee that `b[i]` will match the template, as `b[i]` could be the same as the lowercase version of `a[i]`.
  - The correct approach should be to append an uppercase character that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` when they are different.

- **Matching Conditions:**
  - The condition for `match_c` is incorrect. It should ensure that `c[i]` is different from the lowercase version of the template character if the template character is uppercase, and the same if the template character is lowercase.
  - The current logic for `match_c` is the opposite of what it should be.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        template = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                # Find an uppercase character that is different from both a[i] and b[i]
                for char in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ':
                    if char.lower() != a[i] and char.lower() != b[i]:
                        template.append(char)
                        break
        
        match_a_b = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i] == template[i].lower() or b[i] == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        
        match_c = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i] == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        
        if match_a_b and not match_c:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical errors in template construction and matching conditions.
- The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
