Output State: **`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`. If any character in `template` is lowercase and the corresponding character in `a` or `b` does not match, or if any character in `template` is uppercase and the corresponding character in `a` or `b` matches when converted to lowercase, `match_a_b` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The variable `t` is still `t-1` and must be greater than 0.
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variable `n` must be greater than 0.
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the input strings after stripping leading and trailing whitespace.
- The variable `i` is `n-1`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations.
- The `template` list remains a list of length `n`, with each element being the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`.
- The variable `match_a_b` will be `False` if any character in `template` is lowercase and does not match the corresponding character in `a` or `b`, or if any character in `template` is uppercase and matches the corresponding character in `a` or `b` when converted to lowercase. Otherwise, `match_a_b` will remain `True`.
