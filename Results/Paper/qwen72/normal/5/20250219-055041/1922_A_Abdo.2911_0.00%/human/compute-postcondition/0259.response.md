Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t-1` (initial `t` minus the number of iterations), `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last input strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`. If `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, the loop prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the loop prints 'NO'.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations:
- The variable `t` is now 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `_` has incremented from 0 to `t-1`, where `t` is the initial number of iterations.
- The variable `n` is the length of the last input strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are all of length `n` and consist of lowercase Latin letters with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.
- The variable `i` is `n-1`, which is the index of the last character in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- The variable `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding character from `a` if it matches the corresponding character in `b`, or the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a` if it does not match.
- The loop checks if `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`. If so, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This check is performed for the last set of inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`.
