Output State: **`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 1, `template` is a list containing the first character of `a` and the second character of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains `t-1` and must be greater than 0.
- The value of `_` remains 0.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer that must be greater than 1.
- The value of `a` remains the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace.
- The value of `b` remains the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace.
- The value of `c` remains the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- `template` was initially a list containing the first character of `a`. After executing `template.append(a[i])`, the second character of `a` is added to the list. Therefore, `template` now contains the first character of `a` and the second character of `a`.
