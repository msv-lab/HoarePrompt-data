Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`. If `template[i]` is a lowercase letter and either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_a_b` is `False` and the program has exited the most immediate loop or conditional block. If `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter and either `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` matches `template[i].lower()`, `match_a_b` is `False` and the program has exited the most immediate loop or conditional block. If `template[0]` is a lowercase letter and either `a[0]` is not equal to `template[0]` or `b[0]` is not equal to `template[0]`, `match_a_b` is `False`. If `template[0]` is not a lowercase letter, `match_a_b` is `False`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`.***
