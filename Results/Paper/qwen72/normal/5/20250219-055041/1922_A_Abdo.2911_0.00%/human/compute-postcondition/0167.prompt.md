Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`. If any character in `template` is lowercase and the corresponding character in `a` or `b` does not match, or if any character in `template` is uppercase and the corresponding character in `a` or `b` matches when converted to lowercase, `match_a_b` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`. `match_c` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 0, `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`. If `template[i]` is a lowercase character, `match_c` is `False` if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_a_b` is set to `False` if any character in `template` is lowercase and the corresponding character in `a` or `b` does not match, or if any character in `template` is uppercase and the corresponding character in `a` or `b` matches when converted to lowercase. If `template[i]` is not a lowercase character, `match_c` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if the character at position `i` in `c` is not the same as the character at position `i` in `template` when both are converted to lowercase.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 1, `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`. If `template[i]` is a lowercase character and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_c` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `template[i]` is not a lowercase character and `c[i].lower()` is not equal to `template[i].lower()`, `match_c` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_c` retains its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 2, `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`. If `template[i]` is a lowercase character and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_c` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `template[i]` is not a lowercase character and `c[i].lower()` is not equal to `template[i].lower()`, `match_c` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_c` retains its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
