Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`, and `match_a_b` is `True`. The first element of `template` is a lowercase string, and either `a[0]` is not equal to `template[0]` or `b[0]` is not equal to `template[0]`.**
