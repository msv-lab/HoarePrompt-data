Output State: **`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is an empty list, `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `template = []` reinitializes the `template` list to an empty list, overriding its previous state. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for `match_a_b` and `match_c` are still valid as specified in the initial state.
