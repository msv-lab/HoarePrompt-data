Postcondition: ***`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 2, `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`. If `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` matches `template[i].lower()`, `match_a_b` is set to `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`.***
