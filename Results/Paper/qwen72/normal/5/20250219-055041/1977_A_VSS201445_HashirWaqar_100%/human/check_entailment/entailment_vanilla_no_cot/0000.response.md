Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads the values of `n` and `m`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The condition `n >= m` ensures that the number of moves is at least as many as the number of cubes required in the tower.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes in the tower is even. This is necessary because each move can either add or remove a cube, and the net effect of an even number of moves will be an even change in the number of cubes.

3. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are satisfied, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

This logic is correct because:
- If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to build a tower of `m` cubes with only `n` moves.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even, it means that the number of "add" and "remove" moves can balance out to leave exactly `m` cubes in the tower.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
