Reasoning: 

The original assessment is partially correct but contains a misunderstanding. The program's logic is actually correct for the given problem description. Let's break down the logic and the problem requirements:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - Nikita can only add or remove 1 cube per move.
   - After `n` moves, the tower must have exactly `m` cubes.
   - The number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` are both integers between 1 and 100.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program checks if `n >= m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`**:
     - If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even, it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because the number of moves required to add or remove cubes to reach `m` from 0 must be even (each move adds or removes 1 cube, and the total number of moves must balance out to an even difference).
   - **Case 2: `n < m`**:
     - If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves because you cannot add more cubes than the number of moves you have.
   - **Case 3: `(n - m) % 2 != 0`**:
     - If the difference `(n - m)` is odd, it is impossible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves because the total number of moves (adding and removing) must result in an even difference to reach exactly `m` cubes.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `3 3`:
     - `n = 3`, `m = 3`
     - `n >= m` is true, and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is true.
     - Output: "YES" (Correct)
   - For the input `2 4`:
     - `n = 2`, `m = 4`
     - `n < m` is true, so it is impossible.
     - Output: "NO" (Correct)
   - For the input `5 3`:
     - `n = 5`, `m = 3`
     - `n >= m` is true, and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is true.
     - Output: "YES" (Correct)

5. **Misunderstanding in Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment incorrectly states that the program should output "YES" for `n < m` when `n` and `m` are both odd or both even. This is not correct according to the problem description, as `n < m` always results in "NO" because you cannot add more cubes than the number of moves.

Given the above reasoning, the program's logic is correct for the problem description provided. The original assessment is inaccurate in its criticism of the program.

Final: **True**
