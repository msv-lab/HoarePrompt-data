Based on the initial state provided:

- `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input.
- Either `n` is less than `m` or the difference `(n - m)` is not divisible by 2.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('NO')
```

This statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `n` and `m` or any other variables, because it is a simple print statement that outputs a constant string.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
