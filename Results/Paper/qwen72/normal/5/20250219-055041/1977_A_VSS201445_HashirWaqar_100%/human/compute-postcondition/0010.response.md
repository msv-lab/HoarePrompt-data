Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
2. `_` is 1.
3. `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input.
4. The condition is that if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is an even number, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either `n` is less than `m` or the difference `(n - m)` is not divisible by 2.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`.
- The initial state describes the conditions under which the program operates, but it does not provide any logic that would change the output of the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is unconditional, meaning it will always execute and print `'NO'` regardless of the values of `n` and `m`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
