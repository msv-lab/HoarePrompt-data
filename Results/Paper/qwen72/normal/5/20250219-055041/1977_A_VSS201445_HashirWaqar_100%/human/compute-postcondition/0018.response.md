The function `func` is expected to be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple or list containing two integers `n` and `m`, such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function should handle up to 100 test cases. However, the provided function signature does not include any parameters, which suggests that the function might be using a predefined or global list of test cases.

Given the constraints and the expected output, the function should process each test case and return a result based on the values of `n` and `m`. Since the output details are not provided, I will describe the functionality based on the typical behavior of such a function.

Functionality: **The function processes a list of up to 100 test cases, where each test case is a tuple or list containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100). It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
