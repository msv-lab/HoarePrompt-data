Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input, and the condition that if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is an even number, then the condition is met, otherwise, either `n` is less than `m` or the difference `(n - m)` is not divisible by 2, remains unchanged.**

The values of `n` and `m` are now updated to the integers provided by the user input. The other variables and conditions remain as they were in the initial state.
