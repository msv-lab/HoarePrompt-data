Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, `_` is equal to `int(input()) - 1`, and the final values of `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user input for the last iteration. For each iteration, if `n` was greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` was an even number, 'YES' was printed; otherwise, 'NO' was printed. The initial condition `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and the loop has executed exactly `int(input())` times.**
