Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube. The key points to consider are:

1. **Initial Condition**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Move Constraints**: Each move can only add or remove one cube.
3. **Final Condition**: After `n` moves, the tower should have exactly `m` cubes.

To achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the following must hold:
- The number of moves `n` must be at least as large as the number of cubes `m` (since you can't have more cubes than moves).
- The difference between the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` must be even. This is because each pair of moves (one add and one remove) cancels out, and the net effect of an even number of moves is to add or remove an even number of cubes. Therefore, to end up with an odd number of cubes, the number of moves must also be odd, and vice versa.

The provided program checks these conditions:
- `n >= m` ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to build a tower of `m` cubes.
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which is necessary for the final tower to have exactly `m` cubes.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program correctly handles all the test cases and outputs the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
