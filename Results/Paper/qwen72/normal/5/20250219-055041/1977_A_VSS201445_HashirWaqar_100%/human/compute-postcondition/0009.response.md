Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
2. `_` is 1.
3. `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input.
4. The condition is that if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is an even number, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either `n` is less than `m` or the difference `(n - m)` is not divisible by 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print('YES')` statement will always print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `n` and `m` or any other conditions.
- The initial state provides conditions that must be met, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement is not conditional and will always execute.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always output the string 'YES' because it is not dependent on any of the conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
