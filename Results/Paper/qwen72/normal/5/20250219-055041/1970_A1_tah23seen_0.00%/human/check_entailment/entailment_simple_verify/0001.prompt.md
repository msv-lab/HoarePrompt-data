You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with `d[0] = 0` and `d[i + 1]` is set to `d[i] + 1` if `s[i]` is '(', or `d[i] - 1` if `s[i]` is ')' for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`; `i` is `n - 1`.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` at the indices specified by the keys in `d`, in the order of the values in `d`; `d` is an empty list of tuples, as all tuples have been processed; `i` is the key of the last tuple processed in `d`, and `j` is the value of the last tuple processed in `d`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string `ans` which contains the characters from the string `s` at the indices specified by the keys in `d`, in the order of the values in `d`. Since `d` is an empty list, `ans` will be an empty string.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the input string `n` and immediately calls `func_1(n)`, which is the main function that processes the string.

2. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a dictionary `d` to store the balance of the prefix at each position.
   - It sets `d[0] = 0` to initialize the balance before the first character.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and updates the balance in the dictionary `d` based on whether the current character is an opening parenthesis `(` or a closing parenthesis `)`.
   - The balance is correctly calculated as the number of opening parentheses minus the number of closing parentheses up to the current position.

3. **Removing the Last Element**:
   - The program removes the last element from the dictionary `d` using `d.pop(n)`. This is necessary because the balance at the end of the string (position `n`) is not needed for the sorting step.

4. **Sorting the Dictionary**:
   - The program sorts the dictionary `d` based on the balance values in increasing order. If two positions have the same balance, it sorts them in decreasing order of position.
   - The sorting is done using `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])`, which sorts the items by the balance value.

5. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The program initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result.
   - It iterates through the sorted items and appends the corresponding character from the input string `s` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the constructed string `ans`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)`.

**Issues**:
- The sorting step is incorrect. The problem specifies that in case of a tie in the balance, the positions should be sorted in decreasing order. However, the current sorting step `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])` does not handle this correctly. It sorts by balance in increasing order but does not break ties by position in decreasing order.

**Corrected Sorting**:
- To correctly handle the tie-breaking, the sorting key should be a tuple where the first element is the balance and the second element is the negative of the position. This can be achieved by changing the sorting key to `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect sorting step.

Correctness: **False**
