    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with `d[0] = 0` and `d[i + 1]` is set to `d[i] + 1` if `s[i]` is '(', or `d[i] - 1` if `s[i]` is ')' for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`; `i` is `n - 1`.

    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` at the indices specified by the keys in `d`, in the order of the values in `d`; `d` is an empty list of tuples, as all tuples have been processed; `i` is the key of the last tuple processed in `d`, and `j` is the value of the last tuple processed in `d`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string `ans` which contains the characters from the string `s` at the indices specified by the keys in `d`, in the order of the values in `d`. Since `d` is an empty list, `ans` will be an empty string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty, balanced parentheses string `s` and returns a new string `ans` that rearranges the characters of `s` based on the depth of the parentheses. The characters are ordered such that those at the same depth are grouped together and the groups are ordered from the shallowest to the deepest depth. The final state of the program is that `s` remains unchanged, `n` is the length of `s`, `d` is a dictionary that maps indices to their corresponding depth, and `ans` is the rearranged string.
