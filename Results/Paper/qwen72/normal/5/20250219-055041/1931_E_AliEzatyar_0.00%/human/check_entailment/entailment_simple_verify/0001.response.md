Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `array`.

2. **Digit Counting and Zero Handling:**
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to 0, which will store the total number of digits in the list.
   - It also initializes `zeros` as an empty list, which will store the number of trailing zeros in each integer.
   - For each integer in the list, it adds the length of the integer to `total_digits`.
   - It calls `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in the integer and appends the result to `zeros` if the count is greater than 0.

3. **Trailing Zero Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given integer (represented as a string).

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order.
   - It then iterates through the sorted `zeros` list in steps of 2, summing up the values at even indices to `subtract_zero`.
   - The idea here is to simulate Anna's optimal strategy of reversing integers with trailing zeros, which can potentially reduce the number of digits that Sasha can use to form a large number.
   - However, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. The program assumes that Anna can always reduce the total number of digits by the sum of trailing zeros in pairs, but this does not accurately reflect the game's rules. Sasha can concatenate any two numbers, and the optimal strategy involves more than just counting trailing zeros.

5. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If the condition is met, it sets the answer to "Sashah" (which should be "Sasha").
   - Otherwise, it sets the answer to "Anna".
   - The typo in the output string "Sashah" instead of "Sasha" is indeed a critical error, but it is not the only issue.

6. **Additional Issues:**
   - The program's logic for determining the winner is incorrect. It does not consider the actual game mechanics where Sasha can concatenate any two numbers, and Anna can reverse any number.
   - The game's optimal strategy involves more complex considerations, such as the order in which numbers are chosen and concatenated, and the impact of reversing numbers on the final concatenated result.
   - The current approach of simply subtracting the sum of trailing zeros in pairs does not ensure that the final number will be less than \(10^m\).

**Conclusion:**
- The program has a typo in the output, which makes it incorrect.
- More importantly, the logic for determining the winner is fundamentally flawed and does not correctly simulate the game's rules and optimal strategies.

Final: **False**
