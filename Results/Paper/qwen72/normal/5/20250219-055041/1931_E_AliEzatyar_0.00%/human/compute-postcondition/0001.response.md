The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `num`. The loop iterates over the indices of the list `num` in reverse order, starting from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`. For the loop to execute, the list `num` must have at least one element, and the variable `i` must be set to the starting index, which is `len(num) - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `num` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9, and the length of `num` is in the range 1 to 2 * 10^5.
- `counter` is 0.

We need to ensure that the loop can execute by adjusting the state of `i` and `num`:

State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9, and the length of `num` is in the range 1 to 2 * 10^5; `counter` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`**
