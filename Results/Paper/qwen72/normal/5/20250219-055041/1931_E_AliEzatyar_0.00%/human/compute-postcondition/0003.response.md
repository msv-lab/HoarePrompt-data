Output State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9, and the length of `num` is in the range 1 to 2 * 10^5; `counter` is 1, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, and the last element of `num` is 0.**

The value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
