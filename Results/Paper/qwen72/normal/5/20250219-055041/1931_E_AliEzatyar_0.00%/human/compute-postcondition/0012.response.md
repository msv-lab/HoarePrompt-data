Output State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9, and the length of `num` is in the range 1 to 2 * 10^5; `counter` is 1, 2, or 3, `i` is `len(num) - 3`. If the third-to-last element of `num` is 0, `counter` is 3. If the third-to-last element of `num` is not 0, `counter` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
