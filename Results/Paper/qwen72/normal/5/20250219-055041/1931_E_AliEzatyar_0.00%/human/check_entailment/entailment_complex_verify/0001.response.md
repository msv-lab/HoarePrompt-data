Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `array` as strings, which is appropriate since we need to manipulate the digits.

2. **Digit Counting and Zero Handling:**
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to 0, which will store the total number of digits in the list.
   - It also initializes `zeros` as an empty list, which will store the number of trailing zeros in each integer.
   - For each integer in the list, it adds the length of the integer to `total_digits`.
   - It calls `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in the integer and appends the result to `zeros` if the count is greater than 0.

3. **Trailing Zero Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given integer (represented as a string). The function iterates from the end of the string and counts zeros until it encounters a non-zero digit.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order.
   - It then iterates through the sorted `zeros` list in steps of 2, summing up the values at even indices to `subtract_zero`.
   - The idea here is to simulate Anna's optimal strategy of reversing integers with trailing zeros, which can potentially reduce the number of digits that Sasha can use to form a large number. By summing the values at even indices, the program is effectively simulating Anna removing the trailing zeros from the largest possible numbers, which is a reasonable heuristic.

5. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If the condition is met, it sets the answer to "Sashah" (which should be "Sasha").
   - Otherwise, it sets the answer to "Anna".
   - The typo in setting the answer to "Sashah" instead of "Sasha" is a critical error that affects the correctness of the output.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

**Issues:**
- **Typo in Output:** The program sets the answer to "Sashah" instead of "Sasha". This is a critical error as it will cause the output to be incorrect.

**Conclusion:**
- The program has a typo in the output, which makes it incorrect. The logic for determining the winner based on the optimal play strategy is sound, but the typo in the output string "Sashah" instead of "Sasha" means that the program will not produce the correct output for test cases where Sasha wins.

Final: **False**
