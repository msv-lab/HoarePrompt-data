Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly handle the problem's requirements. Specifically, `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, the problem requires determining if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation (swapping a prefix and a suffix) any number of times.

### Issues:
1. **`func_1` Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` returns 'Yes' if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is not sorted, it immediately returns 'No' without considering the possibility of making it sorted by swapping a prefix and a suffix.

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, you need to check if there exists a way to split the array into two parts such that, when swapped, the resulting array is non-decreasing.
   - This involves finding a valid split point where the prefix and suffix can be swapped to form a non-decreasing array.

### Corrected Function:
Here is a corrected version of `func_1` that should work for the problem:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Find the first position where the array is not sorted
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            break
    else:
        return 'Yes'  # The array is already sorted

    # Find the last position where the array is not sorted
    for j in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        if arr[j] < arr[j - 1]:
            break

    # Check if swapping the prefix [0:i+1] and suffix [i+1:n] makes the array sorted
    if arr[i] <= arr[j] and (i == 0 or arr[j] >= arr[i - 1]) and (j == n - 1 or arr[i] <= arr[j + 1]):
        return 'Yes'
    
    # Check if swapping the prefix [0:j+1] and suffix [j+1:n] makes the array sorted
    if arr[j] <= arr[i] and (j == 0 or arr[i] >= arr[j - 1]) and (i == n - 1 or arr[j] <= arr[i + 1]):
        return 'Yes'
    
    return 'No'
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Function:
1. **Initial Check**:
   - The function first checks if the array is already sorted. If it is, it returns 'Yes'.
   
2. **Finding the First and Last Unsorted Positions**:
   - It then finds the first position `i` where the array is not sorted (i.e., `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`).
   - It also finds the last position `j` where the array is not sorted (i.e., `arr[j] < arr[j - 1]`).

3. **Checking Valid Swaps**:
   - The function checks if swapping the prefix `[0:i+1]` and the suffix `[i+1:n]` results in a sorted array.
   - It also checks if swapping the prefix `[0:j+1]` and the suffix `[j+1:n]` results in a sorted array.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - If either of the above conditions is met, the function returns 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

### Example:
For the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`:
- The first unsorted position is `i = 1` (where `7 > 2`).
- The last unsorted position is `j = 2` (where `2 < 2`).
- Swapping the prefix `[7]` and the suffix `[9, 2, 2, 3]` results in `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`.
- Swapping the prefix `[7, 9]` and the suffix `[2, 2, 3]` results in `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`, which is sorted.

Thus, the function should return 'Yes' for this case.
