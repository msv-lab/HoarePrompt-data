Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from `data[2:2 + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 2 + n, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(arr)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`, `n` is now the integer value of `data[2 + n]`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `n` is reassigned the integer value of `data[index]`, where `index` is `2 + n`.
- The previous values of `t`, `arr`, `data`, `index`, `results`, and `result` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `n` is the integer value of the element in `data` at the position `2 + n`.
