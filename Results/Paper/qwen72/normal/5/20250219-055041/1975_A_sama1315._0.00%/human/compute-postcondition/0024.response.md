Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 3 + 2n + 1 + n, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(arr)` and the new value `result` appended to it, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by `n`.
- The previous value of `index` was `3 + 2n + 1`, so after the increment, `index` becomes `3 + 2n + 1 + n`, which simplifies to `3 + 3n + 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `data`, `results`, and `result`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
