Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. It does not consider the possibility of splitting the array into two parts, swapping them, and then checking if the resulting array is sorted. 

For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 2]`. This array is not sorted, and `func_1` will return "No". However, if we split the array into `x = [3]` and `y = [1, 2]`, and then swap them, we get `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted in non-decreasing order. The program should return "Yes" for this case, but it does not. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
