Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`t` must be greater than 0**: This means `t` is a positive integer.
2. **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50**: This means `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive.
3. **`arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the last valid slice of `data`**: This means `arr` is a list of `n` integers, and these integers are the last `n` elements of the list `data`.
4. **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input**: This means `data` is a list of strings, and these strings are the result of splitting some input.
5. **`index` is `1 + t * (1 + n)`**: This is a calculated index based on `t` and `n`.
6. **`results` is a list containing `t` values, each value being the result of calling `func_1` on the corresponding `arr` in each iteration**: This means `results` is a list of `t` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` on a different `arr` in each iteration.
7. **`result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)` in the last iteration**: This means `result` is the last value added to the `results` list.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`results` List**: The `results` list contains `t` values, each of which is the result of calling `func_1` on a different `arr` in each iteration. Since `t` is a positive integer, `results` will have at least one element.
2. **`func_1` Function**: The function `func_1` is called on different slices of `data` to produce the values in `results`. The exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, but it returns a value that is added to `results`.
3. **`arr` in Each Iteration**: In each iteration, `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from a slice of `data`. The last iteration's `arr` is the one used to calculate the final `result`.
4. **Joining `results`**: The `print` statement joins the elements of the `results` list with a newline character (`\n`) and prints the resulting string.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print each value in the `results` list, separated by a newline. Since the exact values of `func_1` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the results of `func_1`.

Output: **[result_1]
[result_2]
...
[result_t] (where each [result_i] is the result of calling `func_1` on the corresponding `arr` in each iteration)**
