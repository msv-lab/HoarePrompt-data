Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.**

The initial state remains unchanged for `t`, `n`, and `arr`. The `input` function reads a string from standard input, and `data` is assigned the result of splitting this string into a list of substrings. Each element in `data` is a string.
