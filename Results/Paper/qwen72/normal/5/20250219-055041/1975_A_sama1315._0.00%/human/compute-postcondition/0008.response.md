Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `n` is equal to `int(data[1])`.** 

The value of `index` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
