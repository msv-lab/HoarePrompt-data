The function reads input from standard input, processes it to extract a series of test cases, and applies a function `func_1` to each test case. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function then prints the results of `func_1` for each test case, one result per line. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the last valid slice of `data`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `1 + t * (1 + n)`, and `results` is a list containing `t` values, each value being the result of calling `func_1` on the corresponding `arr` in each iteration.
