Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `n` is equal to `int(data[1])`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` converts a slice of `data` (from `index` to `index + n`) into a list of integers and assigns it to `arr`. The slice `data[index:index + n]` contains `n` elements, and each element is converted to an integer. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `data`, `index`, `results`) remain unchanged.
