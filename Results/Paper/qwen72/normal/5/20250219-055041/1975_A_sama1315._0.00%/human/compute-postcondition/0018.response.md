Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 3 + 2n, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(arr)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`, `n` is now the integer value of `data[2 + n]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `result = func_1(arr)` assigns the value returned by `func_1(arr)` to the variable `result`.
- The value of `result` is now the same as the value that was previously returned by `func_1(arr)` and added to the `results` list.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `data`, `index`, and `results`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial state values.
