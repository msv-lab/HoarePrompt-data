The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `func_1()` has been called.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. However, the loop variable `_` is not used and does not affect the state. Since the loop has already executed once, `t` must be decremented by 1 for the next iteration to be valid.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called** 

However, to be more precise and reflect the state at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `func_1()` has been called**
