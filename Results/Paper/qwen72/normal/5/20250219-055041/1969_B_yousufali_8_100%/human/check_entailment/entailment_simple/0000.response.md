### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The string is already sorted if all '1's come before all '0's.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads a binary string `s` from the input.
   - It initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of '1's in the string, and `ans` to accumulate the cost.
   - The loop iterates through each character in the string:
     - If the character is '1', `n` is incremented.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it means there are '1's before this '0', and a cyclic shift is needed to move the '1's to the left. The cost of this shift is `n + 1` (the length of the substring from the first '1' to the current '0').
   - The function prints the total cost `ans`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the binary strings for each test case.
   - **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation in `func_1` is based on the number of '1's that need to be moved to the left of each '0'. This approach is correct because:
     - Each '0' that follows a '1' requires a shift of the substring from the first '1' to the current '0'.
     - The cost of each shift is `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of '1's before the '0'.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - If the string is already sorted (all '1's before all '0's), the cost will be zero, which is correctly handled.
     - If the string consists entirely of '1's or '0's, the cost will also be zero, which is correctly handled.
   - **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading `t` and calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and handles all the specified cases and constraints.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
