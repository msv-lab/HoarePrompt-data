You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0' and '1' characters) with a length of at least 2.
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: `s` is a new binary string input by the user, with a length of at least 2; `i` is `len(s) - 1`; `n` is the number of '1's in `s`; `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' in `s` that follows at least one '1'.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` calculated as described above.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a binary string `s` from user input, where `s` consists of '0' and '1' characters and has a length of at least 2. It calculates a value `ans` based on the number of '1's (`n`) in the string and the positions of '0's that follow at least one '1'. Specifically, for each '0' that follows at least one '1', `ans` is incremented by `n + 1`. The function then prints the final value of `ans` and does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2()`. The function reads an integer `t` from the standard input, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `func_1()` is called.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `func_1()` has been called `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the standard input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. The function does not return any value, and after its execution, `t` will be greater than or equal to the number of times `func_1` has been called.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the case where the string is already sorted, which should have a cost of 0. Additionally, the logic for calculating the cost is flawed. For example, consider the string "101011". The correct minimum cost to sort this string is 5, but the program will output 6. This is because the program incorrectly adds the cost for each '0' encountered after a '1', without considering the optimal way to sort the string.

To illustrate the issue, let's break down the string "101011":
- The first '0' after the first '1' will add 2 to the cost.
- The second '0' after the second '1' will add 3 to the cost.
- The third '0' after the third '1' will add 4 to the cost.

The total cost calculated by the program is 2 + 3 + 4 = 9, but the correct minimum cost should be 5, which can be achieved by cyclically shifting the substring "1010" to "0101" and then shifting "01011" to "00111".

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
