Postcondition: ***`s` is a new binary string input by the user, with a length of at least 2; `i` is 1; `n` is 0 if the first character of `s` is not '1', otherwise `n` is 1 if the second character of `s` is not '1', and `n` is 2 if the second character of `s` is '1'. If `s[i]` (i.e., the second character of `s`) is '0' and `n` is not 0, `ans` is `n + 1` unless the first character of `s` is '0' and `n` is 1, in which case `ans` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 unless the first character of `s` is '0' and `n` is 1, in which case `ans` is 2.***
