The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes several variables and their conditions, but none of these variables are actually used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the code snippet is solely determined by the string literal `'NO'` that is passed to the `print` function.

Output: **NO**
