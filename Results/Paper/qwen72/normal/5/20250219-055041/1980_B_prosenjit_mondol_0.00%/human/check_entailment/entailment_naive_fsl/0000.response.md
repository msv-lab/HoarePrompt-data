Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube's value is equal to the value of the k-th cube after sorting, and the favorite cube is not the last cube in the sorted list. Specifically, if the favorite cube's value is equal to the value of the k-th cube and there are other cubes with the same value after the k-th position, the program incorrectly prints "YES" in some cases where it should print "MAYBE".

Example input where the program fails:
```
1
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```
Expected output: "MAYBE"
Actual output: "YES"

In this case, after sorting, the list could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`, and the favorite cube (index 2) could end up in the third position. Since the value of the k-th cube (index 2) is 3, the program should print "MAYBE" because the favorite cube could either be removed or not removed depending on its position after sorting. However, the program incorrectly prints "YES" because it does not consider the possibility of the favorite cube being in a position that is not removed.
