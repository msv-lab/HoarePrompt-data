Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer input by the user.
   - `f` is an integer input by the user and is now decreased by 2.
   - `k` is an integer input by the user and is now decreased by 2.
   - `_` is not explicitly initialized but the loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user and is now sorted in descending order.
   - `x` is now equal to `a[f]` after `a` has been sorted in descending order.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The values of `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, and `x` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.
   - The loop condition and the sorting of the list `a` are also irrelevant to the output of the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables or the state of the list `a`.

Output: **YES**
