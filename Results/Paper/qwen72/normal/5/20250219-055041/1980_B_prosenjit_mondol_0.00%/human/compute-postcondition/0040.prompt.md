Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100, f and k are integers where 1 <= f, k <= n, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    f -= 1
    k -= 1
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = a[f]
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    if a[k] > x:
        print('NO')
    elif a[k] < x:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` retains its initial integer value, `k` is decreased by 1, `f` is decreased by 1, `_` is not explicitly initialized but the loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user sorted in descending order, and `x` is the integer value at the index `f` in the sorted list `a`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then `a[k]` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer input by the user, `f` is an integer input by the user and is now decreased by 2, `k` is an integer input by the user and is now decreased by 2, `_` is not explicitly initialized but the loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user and is now sorted in descending order, `x` is now equal to `a[f]` after `a` has been sorted in descending order. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then `a[k]` remains greater than `x`. If `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`, then `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is unchanged, `f` is an integer value that has been decremented by 1, `k` is an integer value that has been decremented by 1, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` is now sorted in descending order, `x` is now equal to `a[f]` after `a` has been sorted in descending order. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then `a[k]` remains greater than `x`. If `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`, then `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
