Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `f` is an integer input by the user and is now decreased by 2, `k` is an integer input by the user and is decreased by 1, `_` is not explicitly initialized but the loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user sorted in descending order, and `x` is the integer value at the index `f` in the sorted list `a`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then `a[k]` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`.**
