Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of the new `s`, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of the new `s`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0.**

The code snippet `trightZero = 0` sets the value of `trightZero` to 0. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
