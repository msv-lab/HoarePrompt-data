Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 6, `left` is `n // 2 - 4`, `leftMove` is 0, and at least one of `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` is true. If `s[left - 1] == '0'`, then `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1` and `rightZero` is `rightZero + 1`. Otherwise, `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1` and `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`.**
