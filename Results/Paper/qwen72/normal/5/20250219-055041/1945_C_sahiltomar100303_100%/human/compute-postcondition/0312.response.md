Output State: **`i` is `mid`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightZero` is increased by 2, `trightZero` is increased by 1.** 

The value of `trightZero` is incremented by 1, and the value of `rightZero` is incremented by 1 from its previous state, making it increased by 2 in total. The other variables remain unchanged.
