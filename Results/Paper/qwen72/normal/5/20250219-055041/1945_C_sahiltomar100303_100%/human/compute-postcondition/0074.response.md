Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 4, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `left` is `n // 2 - 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is now less than `(left + 1) // 2 - 1`, `rightOne` remains less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`**

The value of `leftZero` is decremented by 1, making it less than `(left + 1) // 2 - 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
