Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`, `leftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. If `left` is 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left` is greater than 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `left` is set to 0; otherwise, `left` remains greater than 0. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2 - left)` and `((n + 1) // 2 - right)` is such that `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)`. Additionally, the current value of `s[i]` is '0'.**
