Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's in `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's in `s`, `left` is `n // 2`, `leftMove` is 0, and at least one of `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` is true. Additionally, the character at position `left - 1` in the string `s` is not '0'.***
