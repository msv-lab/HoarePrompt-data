Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string a of length n consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident wanting to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident wanting to live on the right side. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5. `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    mid = n // 2
    leftZero = 0
    rightZero = 0
    leftOne = 0
    rightOne = 0
    tleftZero = 0
    trightZero = 0
    tleftOne = 0
    trightOne = 0
    for i in range(mid):
        if s[i] == '0':
            leftZero += 1
            tleftZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne += 1
            tleftOne += 1
    for i in range(mid, n):
        if s[i] == '0':
            rightZero += 1
            trightZero += 1
        else:
            rightOne += 1
            trightOne += 1
    left = mid
    leftMove = 0
    while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left +
        1) // 2):
        if s[left - 1] == '0':
            leftZero -= 1
            rightZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne -= 1
            rightOne += 1
        left -= 1
    right = mid
    while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n -
        right + 1) // 2):
        if s[right] == '0':
            tleftZero += 1
            trightZero -= 1
        else:
            tleftOne += 1
            trightOne -= 1
        right += 1
    if left == 0:
        if right != n:
            print(right)
        elif rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(left)
        else:
            print(right)
    elif right == n:
        if left != 0:
            print(left)
        elif tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(right)
        else:
            print(left)
    elif abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right):
        print(left)
    else:
        print(right)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than `mid`, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`. If `left` is 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, the current state remains unchanged. If `left` is 0 and `right` is not equal to `n`, the current state remains unchanged. If `left` is greater than 0, it remains greater than 0, and `right` remains `n`. If `left` is 0, `tleftZero` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2 - left)` and `((n + 1) // 2 - right)` is either less than or equal to or greater than the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2 - right)` and `((n + 1) // 2 - left)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`. If `left` is 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then if `trightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left` is greater than 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `left` is set to 0; otherwise, `left` remains greater than 0. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2 - left)` and `((n + 1) // 2 - right)` is such that `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)`, and the condition is true; otherwise, the condition is false.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `mid`, `left` is either 0 or not 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is `tleftOne + (n // 2)`, `rightZero` is 0, and `rightOne` is 0. If `left` is 0 and `right` is `n`, and `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` retains its value. If `left` is 0 and `right` is `n`, and `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` remains 0. If `left` is not 0, and `right` is `n`, `tleftZero` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` is not `n`, and the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2)` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2)` and `right`, the if part is executed. Otherwise, the else part is executed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
