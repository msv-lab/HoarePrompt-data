Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `mid`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n // 2`. If the character at index `right` in the string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is `tleftZero + 1` and `rightZero` is `trightZero - 1`. Otherwise, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is `trightZero`, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is `trightOne - 1`, and `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`.***
