Let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0
   - `n` is greater than `mid`
   - `left` is not 0
   - `leftMove` is 0
   - `right` is `n`
   - `leftZero` is 0
   - `leftOne` is `tleftOne + (n // 2)`
   - `rightZero` is 0
   - `rightOne` is 0
   - The current value of `right` is equal to `n`
   - The current value of `left` is not 0

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(left)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `left`:**
   - According to the initial state, `left` is explicitly stated to be not 0.
   - However, the exact value of `left` is not provided. We only know that it is a non-zero value.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(left)` statement will print the value of `left`, which is a non-zero value.
   - Since the exact value of `left` is not specified, we can only describe it as a non-zero value.

Output: **left (where left is a non-zero value)**
