Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0.**

The code snippet initializes a new variable `leftZero` to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `leftZero`.
