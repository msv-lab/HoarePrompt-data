Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `right + 1`, `n` must be greater than `right`, `tleftZero` is `tleftZero + 1`, `tleftZero` must be less than `(right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` must be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`**

The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, and all other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. The updated value of `tleftZero` is `tleftZero + 1`, and it must still satisfy the condition of being less than `(right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` must be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`.
