Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than `mid`, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`, and the current value of `right` is equal to `n`. `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`. If `left` is greater than 0, the current value of `left` remains greater than 0. If `left` is 0, and `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the number of '0's in the first half of `s` meets this condition. Otherwise, the number of '0's in the first half of `s` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`.***
