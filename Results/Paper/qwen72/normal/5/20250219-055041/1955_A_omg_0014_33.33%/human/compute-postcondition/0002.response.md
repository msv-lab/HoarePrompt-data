Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 30, `c` is an integer, `i` is 0**

The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are now assigned based on the input provided. The input is split into three parts, and each part is converted to an integer and assigned to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The previous constraints on `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 30) still hold, and `c` is now an integer. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
