Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is an input integer such that 1 <= a <= 30, `b` is an input integer such that 1 <= b <= 30, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `d` is equal to `c / 2`. If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, the condition `a * b < a * d` holds true. Otherwise, `a * b` is greater than or equal to `a * d`.**

The code snippet `d = c / 2` updates the value of `d` to be half of `c`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The condition `a * b < a * d` is evaluated based on the new value of `d`, which is `c / 2`. If `a * b` is less than `a * (c / 2)`, then the condition holds true; otherwise, it does not.
