Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts, given the prices for one yogurt (`a`) and for two yogurts on promotion (`b`). However, the program has a few issues:

1. **Variable Naming and Usage**: The program uses `a`, `b`, and `c` to represent the inputs, but according to the problem description, the inputs should be `n`, `a`, and `b`. The variable `c` is used where `b` should be, and `b` is used where `n` should be. This is a clear mismatch and will lead to incorrect calculations.

2. **Calculation Logic**: The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is supposed to represent the price of one yogurt if bought as part of the promotion. However, the correct logic should be to compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the promotion price and the regular price. The program's logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the promotion price and the number of yogurts.

3. **Output Logic**: The program prints `a * b` if `a * b` is less than `a * d`, and otherwise prints the rounded value of `a * d`. This logic is incorrect because it doesn't account for the number of yogurts `n` and the correct way to use the promotion price.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Calculate the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price.
- Calculate the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then add the cost of any remaining yogurts at the regular price.
- Compare these two costs and print the minimum.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price
        regular_cost = n * a
        # Cost if as many pairs as possible are bought at the promotion price
        promotion_cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(regular_cost, promotion_cost))
```

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the provided program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
