Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Variable Naming and Input Handling**: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are used incorrectly. According to the problem description, `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts on promotion. However, the program reads `a`, `b`, and `c` as three integers, which is not consistent with the problem description. The correct variables should be `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic used to determine the minimum cost is flawed. The program calculates `d = c / 2` and then compares `a * b` with `a * d`. This does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. The correct approach should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then adding the cost of any remaining yogurts at the regular price.

3. **Incorrect Output Calculation**: The program uses `round(a * d)` to calculate the output, which is not appropriate for this problem. The correct calculation should be based on the number of pairs of yogurts and any remaining yogurts.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible
        pairs_cost = (n // 2) * b
        # Calculate the cost of buying the remaining yogurts at the regular price
        remaining_cost = (n % 2) * a
        # Total minimum cost
        total_cost = pairs_cost + remaining_cost
        print(total_cost)
```

This corrected program correctly handles the input and calculates the minimum cost based on the given problem description.
