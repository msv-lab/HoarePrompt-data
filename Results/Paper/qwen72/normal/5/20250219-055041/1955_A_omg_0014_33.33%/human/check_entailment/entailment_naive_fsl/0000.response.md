Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the program incorrectly assigns the input values to variables and does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying n yogurts.

Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
4
2 5 9
3 5 9
3 5 11
4 5 11
```

**Expected Output:**
```
9
14
15
20
```

**Actual Output:**
```
10
15
15
20
```

The program fails in the first test case. The correct minimum cost for buying 2 yogurts when the promotion price for 2 yogurts is 9 burles and the regular price for 1 yogurt is 5 burles should be 9 burles. However, the program outputs 10 burles.

The issue lies in the incorrect assignment of input values and the logic for calculating the minimum cost. The program should correctly handle the input and logic to ensure the minimum cost is calculated correctly for all cases.
