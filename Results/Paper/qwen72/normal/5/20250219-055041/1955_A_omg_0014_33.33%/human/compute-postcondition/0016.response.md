Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is an input integer such that 1 <= a <= 30, `b` is an input integer such that 1 <= b <= 30, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 2, and `d` is equal to `c / 2`. If the new `a * b` is less than the new `a * d`, the condition `a * b < a * d` holds true. Otherwise, `a * b` is greater than or equal to `a * d`.**
