Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `ans` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the first element of `arr` followed by the second element of `arr`, `arr[0]` is now `nums[0]`, and `ans` remains True if `nums` is sorted; otherwise, `ans` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, the variables retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, `nums` and `ans` retain their values from the previous iteration. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` retains its value from the previous iteration, and `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, and `nums` and `ans` retain their values from the previous iteration. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, and `ans` retains its value from the previous iteration if `nums` is sorted. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
