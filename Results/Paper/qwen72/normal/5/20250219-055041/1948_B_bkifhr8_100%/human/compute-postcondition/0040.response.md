Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the first element of `arr` followed by the second element of `arr`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.***
