To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code snippet).
   - `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans` is True if the loop completes without breaking, or False if the loop breaks due to `arr` not being sorted.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The list `['NO', 'YES']` contains two strings: 'NO' and 'YES'.
   - The expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` will select one of these strings based on the value of `ans`.
   - If `ans` is `True`, the expression will evaluate to `['NO', 'YES'][True]`, which is equivalent to `['NO', 'YES'][1]`, resulting in 'YES'.
   - If `ans` is `False`, the expression will evaluate to `['NO', 'YES'][False]`, which is equivalent to `['NO', 'YES'][0]`, resulting in 'NO'.

4. **Determine `ans`:**
   - The value of `ans` depends on whether the loop that checks if `arr` is sorted completes without breaking.
   - If `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, the loop will complete without breaking, and `ans` will be `True`.
   - If `arr` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, the loop will break, and `ans` will be `False`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, the output will be 'YES'.
   - If `arr` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, the output will be 'NO'.

Output: **'YES' if `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, 'NO' if `arr` is not sorted in non-decreasing order**.
