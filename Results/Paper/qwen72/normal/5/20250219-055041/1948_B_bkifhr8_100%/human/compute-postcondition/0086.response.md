Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True if the loop completes without breaking, or False if the loop breaks due to `nums` not being sorted.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `n` remains greater than 1.
- The placeholder `_` is unchanged.
- The variable `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2.
- The list `arr` is still a list of integers input by the user, but its elements may have been modified during the loop execution.
- The loop variable `i` will be 1 after the loop completes, as the loop iterates from `m - 1` down to 1.
- The variable `ans` will be True if the loop completes without breaking (i.e., all conditions for sorting `nums` were met), or False if the loop breaks because `nums` was not sorted at some point during the iterations.
