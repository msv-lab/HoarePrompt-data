Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True if the loop completed without finding any unsorted `nums` lists, otherwise `ans` is False.**

The code snippet `arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` updates the variable `arr` to be a list of integers input by the user. The other variables (`n`, `_`, `m`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. The specific values of `arr` depend on the user input, but it is now a list of integers.
