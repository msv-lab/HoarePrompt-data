You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer array `a` of length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) with elements in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. The function should determine if it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying the operation of splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits. The input is expected to be provided in a specific format with the first line containing the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), followed by `t` test cases, each with two lines: the first line containing `n` and the second line containing the `n` integers of the array `a`.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: `n` is 0, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True if the loop completes without breaking for all iterations, or False if the loop breaks due to `nums` not being sorted in any of the iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer array `a` of length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) with elements in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. For each test case, it determines if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits. If the array can be sorted in this manner, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state of the program is that all test cases have been evaluated and the appropriate 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed for each.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where an element in the array is greater than or equal to 10 and needs to be split into its digits to achieve a sorted array. Specifically, the program only checks if the digits of the element are sorted, but it does not correctly simulate the operation of splitting the element and inserting the digits back into the array.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
12 3 45 67
```
The program will output `NO` because it checks if the digits of `12` are sorted, which they are, but it does not correctly simulate the operation of splitting `12` into `[1, 2]` and inserting them back into the array. The correct output should be `YES` because after splitting `12` into `[1, 2]`, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, which is sorted.
