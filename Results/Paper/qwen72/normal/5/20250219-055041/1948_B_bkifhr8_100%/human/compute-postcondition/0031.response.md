Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `ans` is False if any of the conditions in the loop caused it to be set to False, otherwise `ans` remains True.**

The value of `m` is updated to the integer input by the user, while the other variables retain their initial states.
