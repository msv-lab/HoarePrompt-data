Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 3, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `m - 3`, `ans` is False, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`, and the value of `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
