Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `ans` is True.**

The variable `ans` is now explicitly set to `True`, overriding any previous value it may have had. The other variables (`n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values.
