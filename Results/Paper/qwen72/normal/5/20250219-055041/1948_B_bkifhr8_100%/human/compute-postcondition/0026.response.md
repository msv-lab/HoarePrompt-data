Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` as separate integers followed by `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `ans` remains True.**

Explanation:
- The value of `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`.
- The value of `i` is `m - 3`.
- The list `nums` contains the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` (before the update) as separate integers followed by `arr[i]`.
- Since the code does not affect the value of `ans`, it remains True.
- The other variables (`n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, `i`) retain their initial states.
