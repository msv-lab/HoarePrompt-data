You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer array `a` of length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) with elements in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. The function should determine if it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying the operation of splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits. The input is expected to be provided in a specific format with the first line containing the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), followed by `t` test cases, each with two lines: the first line containing `n` and the second line containing the `n` integers of the array `a`.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: `n` is 0, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True if the loop completes without breaking for all iterations, or False if the loop breaks due to `nums` not being sorted in any of the iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer array `a` of length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) with elements in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. It returns `True` if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits, and `False` otherwise.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
