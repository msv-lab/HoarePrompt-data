Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` as separate integers followed by `arr[i]`, and `ans` remains True if `nums` is sorted. Otherwise, `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` remains True.**

Explanation:
- `nums` is updated to a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` as separate integers followed by the integer `arr[i]`.
- The values of `n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- `ans` remains True if `nums` is sorted; otherwise, `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
- If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` remains True.
