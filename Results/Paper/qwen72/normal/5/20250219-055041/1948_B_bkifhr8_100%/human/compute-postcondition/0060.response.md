Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True if the loop completed without finding any unsorted `nums` lists, otherwise `ans` is False.** 

The code snippet `m = int(input())` assigns a new value to `m` based on user input, which must be an integer greater than or equal to 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
