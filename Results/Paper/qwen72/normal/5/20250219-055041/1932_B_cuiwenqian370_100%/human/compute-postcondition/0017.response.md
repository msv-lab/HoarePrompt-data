Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2]) * a[2]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2]) * a[2]`**

Explanation: The value of `last_year` is updated to be the same as `next_year`. Since `next_year` was previously calculated as `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2]) * a[2]`, `last_year` now holds this same value. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
