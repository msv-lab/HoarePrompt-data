Functionality: ** The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes multiple sets of data, and writes the results to `sys.stdout`. Each set of data consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. The function computes a value for each set based on the elements of `a` and appends the string representation of this value to a results list. After processing all sets, it writes the results to `sys.stdout`, each on a new line. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `sys.stdout` contains the computed results, and the internal variables used for processing (such as `index`, `results`, `last_year`, and `next_year`) are in their final states after the last iteration. **
