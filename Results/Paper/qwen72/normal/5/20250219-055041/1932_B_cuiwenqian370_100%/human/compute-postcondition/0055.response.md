Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_ + 1`, `index` is incremented by `n + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`a`**: The list `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).
- **`last_year`**: The value of `last_year` will be updated to the result of the expression `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]` after the last iteration of the loop.
- **`next_year`**: Similarly, `next_year` will be equal to the final value of `last_year` after the last iteration.
- **`results`**: The `results` list will include the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year` after each iteration, but since the loop only updates `last_year` and `next_year`, the `results` list will not change in the context provided.
- **`_`**: The variable `_` is incremented by 1, but its exact value is not specified in the initial state, so we only note that it is incremented.
- **`T`**: The condition `T` must be greater than `_ + 1` remains true, as it is a requirement for the loop to execute.
- **`index`**: The `index` is incremented by `n + 1` after the loop completes, as specified in the initial state.
