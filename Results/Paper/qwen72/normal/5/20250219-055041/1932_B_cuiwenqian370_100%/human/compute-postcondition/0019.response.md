Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2]) * a[2]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[3] - 1) // a[3]) * a[3]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 3.
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The value of `last_year` remains `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2]) * a[2]`.
- The value of `next_year` is updated to `((last_year + 1 + a[3] - 1) // a[3]) * a[3]`.
