Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly processes the input and calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that the signs occur sequentially as described in the problem statement.

Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It initializes `index` to 0 and reads the number of test cases `T` from the first element of the list.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Initial Year Calculation**:
   - The initial year for the first sign is set to `last_year = a[0]`.

3. **Sequential Year Calculation**:
   - For each subsequent sign, the program calculates the next year in which the i-th sign will occur using the formula:
     ```python
     next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
     ```
   - This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.

4. **Final Year Calculation**:
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the final year `last_year` is appended to the `results` list as a string.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program writes the results to the standard output, each on a new line.

The annotated code confirms that the program maintains the correct state at each key point:
- `T` is the number of test cases.
- `n` is the number of signs for the current test case.
- `a` is the list of periodicities for the current test case.
- `last_year` is updated correctly for each sign, ensuring that the signs occur in the required sequence.
- `results` is a list of the final years for each test case.

The logic used in the program is consistent with the problem description and ensures that the signs occur sequentially and the final year is correctly calculated. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
