Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2]) * a[2]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[3] - 1) // a[3]) * a[3]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_ + 1`, `index` is incremented by `n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- `next_year` is updated to the value of `((last_year + 1 + a[3] - 1) // a[3]) * a[3]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
