The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2]) * a[2]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2]) * a[2]`**
