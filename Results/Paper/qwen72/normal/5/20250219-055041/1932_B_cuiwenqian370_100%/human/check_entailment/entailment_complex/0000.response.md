### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Computation:**
   - The program initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates over the remaining periodicities in the list `a`.
   - For each periodicity `a[i]`, it calculates the next year `next_year` when the sign will occur, ensuring that it is strictly after the previous sign.
   - The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program appends the string representation of `last_year` to the `results` list after processing each test case.
   - Finally, it writes the results to `sys.stdout`, each on a new line.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where all periodicities are 1, ensuring that the signs occur in consecutive years.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the first test case with `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`, the program correctly computes the years as follows:
     - First sign: 3
     - Second sign: 4
     - Third sign: 8
     - Fourth sign: 10
     - Fifth sign: 18
     - Sixth sign: 36
   - For the second test case with `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the program correctly computes the year as 5.
   - For the third test case with `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the program correctly computes the year as 5.
   - For the fourth test case with `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`, the program correctly computes the year as 2012.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the given problem description and the provided test cases.
