The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. Here, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns. However, we can describe the parameters it accepts.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100) and `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**
