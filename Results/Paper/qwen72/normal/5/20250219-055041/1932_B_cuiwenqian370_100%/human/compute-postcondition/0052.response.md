The loop head in the given task is `for i in range(1, n):`. The only variables that can be adjusted according to the loop head are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since it is a for loop that increments `i` by 1 each iteration), and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3, and `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2]) * a[2]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2]) * a[2]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_ + 1`, `index` is incremented by `n + 1`**
