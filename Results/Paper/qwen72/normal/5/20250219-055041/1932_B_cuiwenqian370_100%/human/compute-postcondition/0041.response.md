Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `i` is `n-1`, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_ + 1`, `index` is incremented by `n`.**

Explanation:
- `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`.
- The value of `a` remains a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`.
- `i` remains `n-1`.
- `last_year` and `next_year` remain unchanged, both still equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`.
- `results` still includes the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year`.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `T` must still be greater than `_ + 1`.
- `index` is incremented by `n`.
