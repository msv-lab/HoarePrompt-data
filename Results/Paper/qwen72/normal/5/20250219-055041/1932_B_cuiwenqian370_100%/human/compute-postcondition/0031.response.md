Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1]) * a[1]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1]) * a[1]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_`, `index` is incremented by `n`.**

Explanation:
- `last_year` is updated to the value of `next_year`.
- The value of `next_year` remains the same as it was before the execution of the code snippet.
- The other variables (`a`, `n`, `i`, `results`, `_`, `T`, `index`) are not affected by the code snippet, so their states remain unchanged.
