Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1]) * a[1]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2]) * a[2]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_`, `index` is incremented by `n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `next_year` is updated to `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2]) * a[2]`.
- The previous value of `next_year` was the same as `last_year`, but now it is recalculated using `a[2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
