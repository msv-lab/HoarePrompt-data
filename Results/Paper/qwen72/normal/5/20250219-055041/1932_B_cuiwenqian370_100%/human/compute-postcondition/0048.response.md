Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1]) * a[1]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_ + 1`, `index` is incremented by `n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- `last_year` is updated to be equal to `next_year`.
- The value of `next_year` remains the same, which is `((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1]) * a[1]`.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`.
- `n` must still be greater than 1.
- `i` remains 1.
- `results` still includes the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year`.
- `_` is still incremented by 1.
- `T` must still be greater than `_ + 1`.
- `index` is still incremented by `n + 1`.
