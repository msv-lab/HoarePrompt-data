Reasoning:  
The program provided has a logical and syntactical issue in the `func_1` function. The function is supposed to handle the movement of players on the grid, but it incorrectly attempts to unpack the movement direction `b` (which is a tuple of integers representing the change in x and y coordinates) as if it were a single integer. This causes a runtime error because `b` is a tuple, not an integer, and cannot be unpacked in the way the function is written.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the Quaffle's movement and the logic for catching and throwing the Quaffle. The Quaffle's position is not tracked separately, and the program does not check if a player is carrying the Quaffle before attempting to score a goal.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the rules of the game as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
