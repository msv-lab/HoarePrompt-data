It seems there was a misunderstanding in the function definition provided. The function described in the problem is `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)`, not `func()`. Let's correct that and extract the precondition for the function based on the problem description:

Function definition:
```
def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):
```

Precondition: **start and end are integers where start <= end, and the current directory contains subfolders with names that can be interpreted as integers within the range [start, end].**
