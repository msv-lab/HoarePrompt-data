Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, the current directory contains subfolders with names that can be interpreted as integers within the range [start, end], `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, and the number of times the character '1' appears in `a` is greater than 0. Additionally, `count` is exactly 2, and the character '1' appears in `a` such that the character immediately following the first occurrence of '1' is also '1'.**
