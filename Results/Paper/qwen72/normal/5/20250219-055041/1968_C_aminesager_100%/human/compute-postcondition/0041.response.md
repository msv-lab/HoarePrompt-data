The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 3).

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` has a new element appended which is the sum of `a[1]` and `T[1]`.**
