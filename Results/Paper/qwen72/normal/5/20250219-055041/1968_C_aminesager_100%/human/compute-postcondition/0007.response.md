The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. The variable `i` will start at 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 500, `a` is a list containing the integer 1000, `line` is a string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
