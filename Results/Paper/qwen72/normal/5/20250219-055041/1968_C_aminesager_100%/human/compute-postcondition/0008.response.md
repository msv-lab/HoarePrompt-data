Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 500, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0], `line` is a string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is 1, `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]`, which is 1000. Similarly, `T[i - 1]` is `T[0]`. Therefore, the new element appended to `a` is `1000 + T[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
