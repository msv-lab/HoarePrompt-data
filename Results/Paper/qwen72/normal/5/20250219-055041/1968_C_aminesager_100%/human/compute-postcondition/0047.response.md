The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- An integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the number of elements in the array `a`.
- A list of `n-1` integers `x` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500) representing the elements of the array `x`.

The function returns:
- For each test case, the missing integer from the array `x` that would make the array `a` complete, where `a` is expected to have `n` elements.

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It returns the missing integer from the list `x` that would make the array `a` complete, where `a` is expected to have `n` elements.**
