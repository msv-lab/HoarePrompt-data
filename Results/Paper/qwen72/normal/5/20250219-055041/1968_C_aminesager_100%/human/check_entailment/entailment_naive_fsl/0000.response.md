Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input array `T` contains values that would cause the constructed array `a` to violate the condition \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\). For example, consider the input:

```
1
4
500 500 500
```

The program will construct the array `a` as follows:
- \(a_1 = 1000\)
- \(a_2 = 1000 + 500 = 1500\)
- \(a_3 = 1500 + 500 = 2000\)
- \(a_4 = 2000 + 500 = 2500\)

This results in \(a_4 = 2500\), which exceeds the limit of \(10^9\). Therefore, the program is incorrect for this input.
