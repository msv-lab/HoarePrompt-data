The code snippet `result = ' '.join(map(str, a))` converts each element in the list `a` to a string and then joins these strings with a space, assigning the resulting string to the variable `result`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the elements of `a` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is `n` - 1, `n` is the same as the initial input, `a` has `n` elements, where each new element from index 1 to `n-1` is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.**
