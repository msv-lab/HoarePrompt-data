Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the same as the initial input, `a` has `n` elements, where each new element from index 1 to `n-1` is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop decrements `t` by 1 each time it runs, and it stops when `t` reaches 0. The variable `n` will retain its value as it is re-assigned from user input at the beginning of each iteration. The list `a` will have `n` elements, where each element from index 1 to `n-1` is the cumulative sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in the list `T`. The variable `result` will be a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, which is printed at the end of each iteration. The other variables (`line` and `T`) are re-assigned within each iteration based on new user input, but their final values are not relevant to the output state after all iterations have completed.
