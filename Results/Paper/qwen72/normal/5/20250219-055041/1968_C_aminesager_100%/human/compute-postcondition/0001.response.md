The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4. Since `t` is already within a range that ensures it is non-zero, no adjustment is needed.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, and `a` is a list of `n-1` integers each between 1 and 500. The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5**
