The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `T` of `n-1` integers. It constructs a new list `a` of `n` elements, where each element from index 1 to `n-1` is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`. The function then prints the elements of `a` as a space-separated string. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0, `n` unchanged from its initial value for the last test case, and `a` containing `n` elements as described.
