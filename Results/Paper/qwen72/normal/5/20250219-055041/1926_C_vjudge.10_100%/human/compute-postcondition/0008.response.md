Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 2, `sum_value_digits` is 3, `x` is '2'**

Explanation:
- `sum_value_digits` is incremented by the integer value of `x`.
- The initial value of `sum_value_digits` is 1.
- The integer value of `x` is 2.
- Therefore, `sum_value_digits` becomes 1 + 2 = 3.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
