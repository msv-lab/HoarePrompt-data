The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `inf`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `inf`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t + 1`, and `inf` is 200001. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `inf` must remain greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros with `values[t + 1]` now equal to `values[t] + sum_value_digits`, `i` is `t + 2`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of `t + 1`, `x` is the last digit of `t + 1`, `values[i]` is now equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`.**
