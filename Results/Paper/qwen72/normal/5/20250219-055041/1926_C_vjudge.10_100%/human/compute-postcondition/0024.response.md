Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros with `values[t + 1]` now equal to `values[t] + the sum of the digits of `t + 1`, `i` is `t + 2`, `sum_value_digits` is 0, `x` is the last digit of `t + 1`, `values[i]` is now equal to `values[i - 1] + the sum of the digits of `t + 1`.**
