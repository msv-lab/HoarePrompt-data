Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`t`**: An input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable represents the number of test cases.
2. **`n`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) for each test case. This variable represents the size of the input for each test case.
3. **`inf`**: A constant integer value of 200001.
4. **`values`**: A list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` inclusive for all `i` from 1 to `inf - 1` (i.e., 200000).
5. **`i`**: Set to `inf`, which is 200001.
6. **`sum_value_digits`**: The sum of the digits of `inf - 1`, which is 200000. The sum of the digits of 200000 is \(2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2\).
7. **`x`**: The last digit of `inf - 1`, which is 0.
8. **`value`**: An input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(values[value])
```

### Analysis:
- The `values` list is precomputed such that `values[i]` contains the sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` inclusive.
- The `value` variable is an input integer, and the `print` statement will output the value at index `value` in the `values` list.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the value at index `value` in the `values` list. Since `values` is precomputed and `value` is an input integer, the output will be the sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to `value` inclusive.

Output: **values[value] (where values[value] is the sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to value inclusive)**
