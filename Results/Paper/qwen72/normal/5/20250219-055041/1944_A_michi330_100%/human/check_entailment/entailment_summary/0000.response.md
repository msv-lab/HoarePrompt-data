Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys up to `k` bridges. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it means that Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1 from all other islands. In this case, Everule can only visit island 1, so the program correctly prints `1`.
2. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it means that Dominater cannot isolate island 1 from all other islands, and Everule will still be able to visit all `n` islands. This is because even if some bridges are destroyed, there will always be a path from island 1 to any other island through the remaining bridges. Therefore, the program correctly prints `n`.

The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description and correctly applies the logic for each test case. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
