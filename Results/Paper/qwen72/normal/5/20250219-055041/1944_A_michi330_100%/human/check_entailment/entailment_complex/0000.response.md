### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input. It then iterates `t` times, each time reading the values of `n` (number of islands) and `k` (maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed) for each test case.

2. **Logic for Bridge Destruction**:
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it means Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate Everule on island 1. In this case, the function prints `1`, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1.
   - If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it means Dominater cannot isolate Everule on island 1, and Everule can still visit all `n` islands. In this case, the function prints `n`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 1`, `k` can be 0. Since there are no other islands, Everule can only visit island 1, which is correctly handled by the condition `k >= n - 1` (since `n - 1` is 0).
   - For `k = 0`, the function correctly prints `n` because no bridges are destroyed, and Everule can visit all islands.
   - For `k = \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}`, the function correctly prints `1` because all bridges can be destroyed, isolating Everule on island 1.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The logic is based on the observation that if Dominater can destroy at least `n - 1` bridges, Everule will be isolated on island 1. This is because there are `n - 1` bridges connecting island 1 to the other `n - 1` islands.
   - If fewer than `n - 1` bridges are destroyed, Everule can still reach all islands, either directly or through a series of bridges.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the correct output for each test case based on the logic described above.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater destroys bridges optimally. The program handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
