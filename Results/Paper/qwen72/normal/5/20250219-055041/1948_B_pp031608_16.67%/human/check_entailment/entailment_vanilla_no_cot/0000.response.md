Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the operation of splitting elements into their digits and checking if the array can be sorted. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the list is already sorted. However, it is called before any operations are performed, and then again after the operations. This is not the correct way to determine if the array can be sorted by the given operations.

2. **Incorrect Operation Application**:
   - The program attempts to split elements only if the current element is greater than the previous element and the previous element is greater than 10. This is not the correct logic for the operation. The operation should be applied to any element that is at least 10, regardless of its position in the array.

3. **Inefficient and Incorrect Loop**:
   - The loop that applies the operation is not efficient and does not correctly handle the splitting of elements. It only splits one element per iteration and does not check if the array is sorted after each split. Additionally, it does not handle the case where multiple elements need to be split.

4. **Missing Recursive or Iterative Approach**:
   - The problem requires a more sophisticated approach to determine if the array can be sorted. The program should recursively or iteratively apply the operation to all elements that are at least 10 and then check if the resulting array is sorted.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should:
1. Split all elements that are at least 10 into their digits.
2. Check if the resulting array is sorted.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def split_digits(x):
    return [int(d) for d in str(x)]

def can_be_sorted(a):
    # Split all elements that are at least 10
    new_a = []
    for num in a:
        if num >= 10:
            new_a.extend(split_digits(num))
        else:
            new_a.append(num)
    
    # Check if the new array is sorted
    return new_a == sorted(new_a)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version correctly splits all elements that are at least 10 and then checks if the resulting array is sorted.
