Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for splitting numbers and checking if the array can be sorted is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
```

The program fails in the second test case. Let's break down why:

1. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `12 28 5`
   - The program checks if the array is sorted using `func_1(list1)`.
   - Initially, `list1` is `[12, 28, 5]`, which is not sorted.
   - The program then iterates through the array and checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if it is greater than 10.
   - It finds that `12` is greater than `5` and `12` is greater than 10.
   - It splits `12` into `[1, 2]` and inserts them back into the array, resulting in `[1, 2, 28, 5]`.
   - The array is still not sorted, and the program continues to the next iteration.
   - It finds that `28` is greater than `5` and `28` is greater than 10.
   - It splits `28` into `[2, 8]` and inserts them back into the array, resulting in `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`.
   - The array is still not sorted, and the program continues to the next iteration.
   - It finds that `8` is greater than `5` and `8` is greater than 10, but it does not split `8` because it is less than 10.
   - The program then checks if the array is sorted using `func_1(list1)`, which returns `False`.
   - The program prints `NO`.

However, the correct output for this test case should be `NO` because it is impossible to sort the array `[12, 28, 5]` using the given operations. The program's logic for splitting and checking the array is not robust enough to handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it does not consider the possibility of multiple splits and their impact on the overall sorting of the array.
