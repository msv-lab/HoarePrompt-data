### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Sorting Check Function**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version. This is a valid and efficient way to check if a list is sorted.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates through each element of the array starting from the second element.
   - It checks if the current element is less than the previous element and if the previous element is greater than or equal to 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the list at the appropriate positions.

4. **Insertion Logic**:
   - The program correctly splits the element `a` into its tens and units digits using integer division (`a // 10`) and modulo (`a % 10`).
   - It then removes the original element and inserts the digits in the correct positions.

5. **Final Check**:
   - After processing the array, the program uses `func_1` to check if the array is now sorted.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues and Concerns:
- **Infinite Loop Potential**:
  - The program does not handle the case where the array might need multiple iterations to become sorted. For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the first iteration will split `12` into `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, but the array is still not sorted. The program should continue to split and check until the array is sorted or until no more splits are possible.

- **Incorrect Splitting Logic**:
  - The program only splits elements if the previous element is greater than 10 and the current element is less than the previous element. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of splitting elements that are greater than or equal to 10 but do not cause an immediate out-of-order condition. For example, in the array `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will not split `28` because `12` is not greater than `28`.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program should use a more efficient approach to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting elements. It should consider all elements that are greater than or equal to 10 and split them, then check if the resulting array is sorted.

### Analysis of Annotated Code:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program and the function `func_1`.
- The function `func_1` is indeed a valid way to check if a list is sorted.
- The main logic of the program, however, is flawed as it only considers splitting elements when they cause an immediate out-of-order condition, which is not sufficient to ensure the array can be sorted.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not handle the potential need for multiple iterations to sort the array and it has flawed logic for determining which elements to split.

### Final: **False**
