#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the lengths of sticks for a test case. The length of arr is between 1 and 100, inclusive, and each inner list contains between 1 and 100 integers, inclusive, with each integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of lists with the same content as the initial state. `freq` is a dictionary where each key is an inner list from `arr`, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that specific inner list appears in `arr`.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 3. Each value in the `freq` dictionary represents the number of times a specific inner list appears in `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists `arr`, where each inner list contains integers representing stick lengths. It returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique inner list by 3. The function does not modify the input `arr`.
