Output State: **`arr` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 inner list, `n` is the first inner list in `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with `n` as a key and the value 1.**

Explanation:
- `freq[n]` assigns the value `freq.get(n, 0) + 1` to the key `n` in the dictionary `freq`.
- Since `freq` was initially an empty dictionary, `freq.get(n, 0)` returns 0.
- Therefore, `freq[n]` is set to 0 + 1, which is 1.
- The values of `arr` and `n` remain unchanged.
