Postcondition: **`a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= m <= n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m, `b_freq` is a dictionary-like object that counts the frequency of each integer in the list `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of the first m integers in the list `a`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `window_freq[a[0]]` is decreased by 1, `matches` and `good_subarrays` remain unchanged, and the current value of `window_freq[a[0]]` is 0.**
