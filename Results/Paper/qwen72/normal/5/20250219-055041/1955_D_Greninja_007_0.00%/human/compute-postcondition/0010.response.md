Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= m <= n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m, `b_freq` is a dictionary-like object that counts the frequency of each integer in the list `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of the first m integers in the list `a`, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than `m`. If `a[i]` is in `b_freq`, `matches` is updated to the sum of the minimum frequencies of each integer in the first m integers of `a` and the corresponding frequencies in `b` minus the minimum of `window_freq[a[i]]` and `b_freq[a[i]]`. If `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, `good_subarrays` is 1. Otherwise, `good_subarrays` remains 0. If `a[i]` is not in `b_freq`, `matches` and `good_subarrays` remain unchanged.***
