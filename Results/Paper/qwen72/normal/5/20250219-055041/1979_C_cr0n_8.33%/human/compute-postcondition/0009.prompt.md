Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each element in `cases` is a list containing two elements: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome is winning. `N` is an input integer. `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where each integer is stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and converted to an integer. `prod` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for r in vals:
    prod *= r


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of test cases, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `prod` is now equal to the first element of `vals`, `r` is the first element of `vals`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of test cases, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `prod` is now equal to the product of the first two elements of `vals`, `r` is the second element of `vals`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of test cases, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `prod` is now equal to the product of the first three elements of `vals`, `r` is the third element of `vals`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
