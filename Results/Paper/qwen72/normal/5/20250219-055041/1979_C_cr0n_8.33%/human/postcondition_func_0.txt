The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` from the input, followed by a list of `N` integers. It calculates the product of all integers in the list (`prod`), and then computes a new list (`vprod`) where each element is the product of all integers in the list except the corresponding element. It also calculates a denominator (`den`) as the difference between `prod` and the sum of all elements in `vprod`. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` and returns. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.
