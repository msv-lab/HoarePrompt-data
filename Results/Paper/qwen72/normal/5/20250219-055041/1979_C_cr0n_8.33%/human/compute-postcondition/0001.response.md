Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each element in `cases` is a list containing two elements: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome is winning. `N` is an input integer. `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where each integer is stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and converted to an integer.**
