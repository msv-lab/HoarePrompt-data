The function `solve` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of integers `k` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The function should output a list of integers `x` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) representing the bets on each outcome, or -1 if no valid distribution exists. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
