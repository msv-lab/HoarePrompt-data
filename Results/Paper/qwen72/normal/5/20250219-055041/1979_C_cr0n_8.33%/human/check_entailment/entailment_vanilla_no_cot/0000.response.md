Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `prod`**:
   - The program calculates `prod` as the product of all `k_i` values. This is not necessary and can lead to very large numbers, which can cause overflow or performance issues.
   - The correct approach is to find a way to distribute the coins such that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `vprod`**:
   - The program calculates `vprod` as `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`. This is not a valid way to distribute the coins to ensure the condition is met.
   - The correct approach is to find a set of bets `x_i` such that the sum of all bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

3. **Incorrect Denominator Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `den` as `prod - sum(vprod)`. This is not the correct way to determine if a valid distribution of coins exists.
   - The correct condition to check is whether the sum of the bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to find a set of bets `x_i` such that the sum of all bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. One way to do this is to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the `k_i` values and distribute the bets accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def find_lcm(nums):
    return reduce(lcm, nums)

cases = int(input())
for _ in range(cases):
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    lcm_val = find_lcm(vals)
    bets = [lcm_val // r for r in vals]
    total_bets = sum(bets)
    
    if total_bets < lcm_val:
        print(' '.join(map(str, bets)))
    else:
        print(-1)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **LCM Calculation**:
   - The LCM of the `k_i` values is calculated using the `lcm` function and the `reduce` function from the `functools` module.
   - The LCM ensures that the bets are distributed in such a way that the sum of the bets is minimized while still meeting the condition.

2. **Bets Calculation**:
   - Each bet `x_i` is calculated as `lcm_val // k_i`.
   - The sum of all bets is then calculated.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - If the sum of all bets is strictly less than the LCM value, the bets are valid and are printed.
   - If not, `-1` is printed, indicating that no valid distribution exists.

This approach ensures that the program correctly solves the problem for all valid inputs.
