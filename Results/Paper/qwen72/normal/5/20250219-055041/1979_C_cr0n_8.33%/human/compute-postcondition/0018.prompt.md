You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each element in cases is a list containing two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome is winning.
def func_1():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    prod = 1
    for r in vals:
        prod *= r
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of test cases, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers, `prod` is now equal to the product of all elements in `vals`, `r` is the last element of `vals`.
    vprod = [(prod // r) for r in vals]
    den = prod - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of test cases, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers, `prod` is now equal to the product of all elements in `vals`, `r` is the last element of `vals`, `vprod` is a list where each element is the product of all elements in `vals` except the corresponding element in `vals`, and `den` is equal to `prod` - the sum of all elements in `vprod`. Additionally, `den` is greater than 0.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: [vprod elements separated by spaces] (where each element in vprod is the product of all elements in vals except the corresponding element in vals)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
