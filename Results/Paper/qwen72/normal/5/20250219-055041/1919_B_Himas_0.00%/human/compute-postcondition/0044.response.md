Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is a new input integer greater than 1, `e` is a new input string, `P` is the number of `+` characters in the new `e`, `M` is the number of characters in the new `e` that are not `+`.**

The value of `e` is updated to a new input string, and the values of `P` and `M` are recalculated based on the new `e`. The values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged.
