Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is an input integer greater than 0, `e` is a new input string, `P` is the number of `+` characters in `e`, `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not `+`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` remains 1, `s` remains an input integer greater than 0, and `e` is the original input string. The variable `P` will be the count of `+` characters in the string `e`, and the variable `M` will be the count of all other characters in the string `e` that are not `+`.
