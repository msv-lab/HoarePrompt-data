Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is a new input integer greater than 1, `e` is a new input string, `P` is 0, `M` is the number of characters in the new `e` that are not `+`.**

The variable `P` is reset to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. `i` is still 2, `s` is still a new input integer greater than 1, `e` is still a new input string, and `M` is still the number of characters in `e` that are not `+`.
