Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to split a string `s` of '+' and '-' characters into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of the sum of its elements multiplied by its length. The elements of the array are 1 for '+' and -1 for '-'.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string itself.
   - It initializes two counters, `P` for the number of '+' characters and `M` for the number of '-' characters.
   - It iterates through the string and increments `P` for each '+' and `M` for each '-'.
   - Finally, it prints `P - M`.

3. **Evaluating the Program**:
   - The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string.
   - However, the problem requires the minimum possible penalty, not just the difference between the counts of '+' and '-'.
   - The penalty calculation for a subarray is \( |c_1 + c_2 + \ldots + c_m| \cdot m \), where \( c_i \) is the value of the character (1 for '+' and -1 for '-').
   - The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to split the array into subarrays such that each subarray has a sum of 0 if possible. If not, the subarrays should be as small as possible to minimize the penalty.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To minimize the penalty, we should try to balance the subarrays as much as possible.
   - If the string has an equal number of '+' and '-' characters, the optimal split would be to pair each '+' with a '-' to form subarrays with a sum of 0, resulting in a total penalty of 0.
   - If the string has an unequal number of '+' and '-' characters, the optimal split would be to form subarrays of length 1 for the remaining characters, each contributing a penalty of 1.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty. It simply calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the same as the minimum possible penalty.
   - The program's output does not match the expected output for the given examples. For instance, for the input `+-+-+`, the program outputs `0`, but the correct output should be `0` because the string can be split into subarrays with a sum of 0.
   - For the input `--+++++++`, the program outputs `7`, but the correct output should be `4` because the optimal split would be to form subarrays of length 1 for the remaining characters, each contributing a penalty of 1.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
