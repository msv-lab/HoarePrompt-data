The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. Since the input `s` is already given as an integer greater than 0, and `i` is the loop variable, we need to adjust `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `s`.

State: **`i` is 1, `s` is an input integer greater than 0, `e` is an input string, `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not '+'**
