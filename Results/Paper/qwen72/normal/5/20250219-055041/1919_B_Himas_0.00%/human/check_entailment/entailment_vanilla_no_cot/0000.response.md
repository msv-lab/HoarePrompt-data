Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and prints this difference. However, this does not correspond to the minimum possible penalty as defined in the problem statement.

The penalty is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the sums of the subarrays, each multiplied by their length. The program should aim to split the array in such a way that the total penalty is minimized. The correct approach involves ensuring that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible, which can be achieved by pairing '+' and '-' characters whenever feasible.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses the problem correctly:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        
        # Convert string to array of 1 and -1
        a = [1 if c == '+' else -1 for c in s]
        
        # Initialize variables
        min_penalty = 0
        current_sum = 0
        
        # Calculate the minimum penalty
        for value in a:
            current_sum += value
            min_penalty += abs(current_sum)
        
        results.append(min_penalty)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# To run the function with input, you can use:
# func()
```

This program reads all input at once to handle multiple test cases efficiently, converts the string to an array of 1s and -1s, and calculates the minimum penalty by summing the absolute values of the cumulative sums of the array elements. This approach ensures that the penalty is minimized by considering each element in the sequence and updating the cumulative sum accordingly.
