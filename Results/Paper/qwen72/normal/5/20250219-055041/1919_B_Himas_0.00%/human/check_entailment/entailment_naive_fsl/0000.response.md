Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly follow the problem description for calculating the minimum possible penalty. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters and prints this difference. However, the problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array into subarrays and calculating the penalty based on the sum of each subarray. In the given example, the optimal way to split the array is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, which results in a penalty of `0 + 0 = 0`. The program, however, does not perform this splitting and instead directly calculates the difference, leading to an incorrect result.
