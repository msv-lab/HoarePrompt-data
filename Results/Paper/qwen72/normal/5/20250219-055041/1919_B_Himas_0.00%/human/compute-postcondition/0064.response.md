The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases and is constrained to the range 1 to 1000 (inclusive). Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. The integer `n` is constrained to the range 1 to 5000 (inclusive), and the string `s` consists only of the characters "+" and "-".

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function evaluates the string `s` and returns a specific value based on the evaluation of `s`.
