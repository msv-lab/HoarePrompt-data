Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of '+' and '-' characters. It then calculates the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and prints this difference. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, `i` is `t-1`, `s` is the last input integer greater than 0, `e` is the last input string, `P` is the number of '+' characters in the last input string, and `M` is the number of '-' characters in the last input string. **
