Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is a new input integer greater than 1, `e` is a new input string, `P` is the number of `+` characters in `e`, `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not `+`**

The code snippet `s = int(input())` updates the value of `s` to a new input integer, which is still greater than 1. The other variables (`i`, `e`, `P`, and `M`) remain unchanged.
