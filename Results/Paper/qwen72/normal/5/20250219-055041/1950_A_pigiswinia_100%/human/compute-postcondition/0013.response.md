Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the new input integers. If the new `a` is less than the new `b` and the new `b` is less than the new `c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds. Otherwise, it is not the case that the new `a` is less than the new `b` and the new `b` is less than the new `c`. If the new `a` is less than the new `b` and the new `b` is greater than the new `c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds. Otherwise, the condition `a < b > c` does not hold.**
