The code snippet provided contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'PEAK'`. However, the initial state describes conditions involving the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, but does not explicitly state whether the condition `a < b > c` holds or not. Since the `print` statement is executed regardless of the conditions, we can determine that the string `'PEAK'` will always be printed.

Output: **PEAK**
