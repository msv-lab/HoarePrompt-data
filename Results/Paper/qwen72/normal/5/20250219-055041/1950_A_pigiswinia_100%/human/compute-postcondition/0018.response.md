Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 1, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to new input integers. If the new `a` is less than the new `b` and the new `b` is less than the new `c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds. If the new `a` is less than the new `b` and the new `b` is greater than the new `c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds. If neither of these conditions is met, then neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` holds.***
