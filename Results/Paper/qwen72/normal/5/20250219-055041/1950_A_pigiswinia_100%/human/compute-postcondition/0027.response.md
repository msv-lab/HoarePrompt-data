The function `func` does not explicitly specify the parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships provided, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters or a list of parameters for each test case, where `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The function's output is not specified in the given information, but typically, such a function would process these inputs and return a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.

Given the lack of specific output details, I will describe the functionality based on the input parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of three digits (a, b, c) where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, and processes each test case. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. The exact return value for each test case is not specified, but it likely returns a result based on the values of a, b, and c.**
