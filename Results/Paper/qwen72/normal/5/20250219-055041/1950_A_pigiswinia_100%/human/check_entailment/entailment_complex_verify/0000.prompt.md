You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is `t-1`, and for each iteration `i` from 0 to `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds, and 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds, and 'PEAK' is printed. If neither of these conditions is met, then 'NONE' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, where `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`. It then evaluates the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by comparing the three digits according to the conditions specified in the problem description. The conditions `a < b < c` for a stair and `a < b > c` for a peak are accurately checked, and the program outputs "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" accordingly. No edge cases or logical errors are present in the provided code that would cause it to fail for any valid input within the specified constraints.
