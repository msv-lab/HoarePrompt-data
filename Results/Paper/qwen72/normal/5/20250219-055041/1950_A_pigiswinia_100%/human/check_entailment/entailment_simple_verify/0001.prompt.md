You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is `t-1`, and for each iteration `i` from 0 to `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds, and 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds, and 'PEAK' is printed. If neither of these conditions is met, then 'NONE' is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if the digits form a stair by evaluating the condition `a < b < c`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - If the condition is false, it checks if the digits form a peak by evaluating the condition `a < b > c`.
   - If the peak condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither condition is true, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the input format by reading the number of test cases and then reading three digits for each test case.
- The conditions `a < b < c` and `a < b > c` are correctly implemented to check for a stair and a peak, respectively.
- The program prints "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions, which matches the problem description.

### Example Test Cases:
- For the input `1 2 3`, the program will print "STAIR" because `1 < 2 < 3`.
- For the input `3 2 1`, the program will print "NONE" because neither `3 < 2 < 1` nor `3 < 2 > 1` is true.
- For the input `1 5 3`, the program will print "PEAK" because `1 < 5 > 3`.
- For the input `0 0 0`, the program will print "NONE" because neither `0 < 0 < 0` nor `0 < 0 > 0` is true.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither, and it handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
