### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, which is appropriate for the given input format.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if the digits form a stair by evaluating the condition `a < b < c`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - If the condition is false, it checks if the digits form a peak by evaluating the condition `a < b > c`.
   - If the peak condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither condition is true, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions provided in the problem description.
   - The output format matches the problem requirements.

### Verification Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`.
  - For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits (integers) such that `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`.

- **Loop Execution:**
  - The loop runs `t` times, processing each test case.
  - Inside the loop, `a`, `b`, and `c` are correctly read and converted to integers.

- **Condition Evaluation:**
  - The condition `a < b < c` is correctly evaluated to check for a stair.
  - The condition `a < b > c` is correctly evaluated to check for a peak.
  - The `else` block correctly handles the case where neither condition is met, printing "NONE".

- **Final State:**
  - After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value, which is expected for this problem.

### Example Test Cases:

- For the input `1 2 3`, the program will print "STAIR" because `1 < 2 < 3`.
- For the input `3 2 1`, the program will print "NONE" because neither `3 < 2 < 1` nor `3 < 2 > 1` is true.
- For the input `1 5 3`, the program will print "PEAK" because `1 < 5 > 3`.
- For the input `0 0 0`, the program will print "NONE" because neither `0 < 0 < 0` nor `0 < 0 > 0` is true.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither, and it handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. The original assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
