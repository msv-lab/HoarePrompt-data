Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It reads the number of test cases and processes each case by checking the conditions specified in the problem description:

1. If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
2. If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
3. Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

The program handles the input and output as required by the problem statement, and the conditions used in the program accurately reflect the definitions of a stair and a peak. Therefore, the program is correct.
