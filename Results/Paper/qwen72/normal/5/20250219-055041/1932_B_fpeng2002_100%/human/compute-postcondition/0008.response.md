The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the list `nums`. If `x` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1, and `nums` must have at least one more element (i.e., at least 2 elements in total).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is an integer such that 0 <= num_tests < initial `num_tests`, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is 1**
