Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is an integer such that 0 <= num_tests < initial `num_tests`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the second-to-last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the third-to-last element in `nums` and so on, up to the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 0, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `start_year` will be the smallest multiple of the last element in the `nums` list that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the second-to-last element, and so on, all the way up to the smallest multiple of the first element in the `nums` list that is greater than or equal to 0. The variable `x` will be equal to `len(nums) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the `nums` list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num_tests`) remain unchanged.
