Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is an integer such that 0 <= num_tests < initial `num_tests`, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the product of all elements in `nums` that is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the last index of `nums` (i.e., `len(nums) - 1`)**

Explanation:
- `num_tests` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `initial num_tests - 1`.
- The value of `num_tests` is now in the range 0 <= `num_tests` < initial `num_tests`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `nums`, `start_year`, `x`) remain unchanged.
