Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is an integer such that 0 <= num_tests < initial `num_tests`, `start_year` is 0, `nums` is a new list of integers input by the user, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.**

The value of `start_year` is set to 0, overriding its previous value. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
