### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then initializes an empty list `final` to store the results of each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `a` (which is `n`), and the list of integers `b`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes a score `s` to 0 for each test case.
   - It converts the input string `b` into a list of integers `list2`.
   - It sorts the list `list2` in ascending order.
   - It iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first element of each pair (i.e., the smaller element) to the score `s`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each score in the `final` list.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The problem requires finding the maximum score by repeatedly selecting two integers and adding the minimum of the two to the score.
  - By sorting the list and always selecting the smallest element of each pair, the program ensures that the smallest elements are used first, which maximizes the score.
  - This approach is optimal because the smallest elements are always chosen, and the sum of the smallest elements in each pair will be the maximum possible score.

- **Input and Output:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the input for each test case.
  - It processes each test case independently and stores the results in the `final` list.
  - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly.
  - It also handles larger values of `n` up to 50, as specified in the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy for solving the problem. It correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the maximum possible score for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
