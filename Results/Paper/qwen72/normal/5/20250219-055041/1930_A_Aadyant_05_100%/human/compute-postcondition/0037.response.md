Output State: **`n` must be an integer greater than 1, `num` is 1, `final` is 0, `s` is 0, `list1` is a list of words from the user input `b` that must have at least 3 words, `str` is the third word in `list1`, `i` is 1, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first word in `list1`, the integer value of the second word in `list1`, and the integer value of `str` (the third word in `list1`), `a` is the user input, `b` is the user input.**

Explanation:
- `list2.append(int(str))` adds the integer value of `str` (which is the third word in `list1`) to the end of `list2`.
- The initial state of `list2` contains the integer values of the first and second words in `list1`.
- After appending `int(str)`, `list2` now contains three elements: the integer values of the first, second, and third words in `list1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
