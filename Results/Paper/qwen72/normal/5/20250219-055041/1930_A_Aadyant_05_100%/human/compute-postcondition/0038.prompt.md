Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be an integer greater than 1, `num` is 1, `final` is a list containing the sum of all elements at even indices in `list2` (which is 0 since `list2` is empty), `s` is 0, `list1` is a list of words from the user input `b`, `str` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is the user input, `b` is the user input.
Code of the loop:
for str in list1:
    list2.append(int(str))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be an integer greater than 1, `num` is 1, `final` is a list containing the sum of all elements at even indices in `list2` (which is now 0 since `list2` contains one element), `s` is 0, `list1` is a list of words from the user input `b` that must have at least 1 word, `str` is the first word in `list1`, `i` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first word in `list1`, `a` is the user input, `b` is the user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be an integer greater than 1, `num` is 1, `final` is a list containing the sum of all elements at even indices in `list2` (which is now 0 since `list2` initially contains one element), `s` is 0, `list1` is a list of words from the user input `b` that must have at least 2 words, `str` is the second word in `list1`, `i` is 1, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first word in `list1` and the integer value of the second word in `list1`, `a` is the user input, `b` is the user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be an integer greater than 1, `num` is 1, `final` is 0, `s` is 0, `list1` is a list of words from the user input `b` that must have at least 3 words, `str` is the third word in `list1`, `i` is 1, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first word in `list1`, the integer value of the second word in `list1`, and the integer value of `str` (the third word in `list1`), `a` is the user input, `b` is the user input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
