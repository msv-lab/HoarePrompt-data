Output State: **`n` must be an integer greater than 0, `num` is 0, `final` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first word in `list1` and the integer value of the second word in `list1`, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string, `list1` is a list of words from `b` split by whitespace that must have at least two words, `str` is the second word in `list1`**

Explanation:
- `list2.append(int(str))` adds the integer value of the second word in `list1` (which is stored in `str`) to the list `list2`.
- The initial state specifies that `list2` contains the integer value of the first word in `list1`. After the code execution, `list2` now contains both the integer value of the first word and the integer value of the second word in `list1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `num`, `final`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `list1`, `str`) remain unchanged.
