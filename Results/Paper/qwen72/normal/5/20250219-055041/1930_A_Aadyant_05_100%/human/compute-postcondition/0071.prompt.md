Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) with each integer a_i in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. `n` is a string representing user input. `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for num in range(int(n)):
    s = 0
    list2 = []
    a = input()
    list1 = []
    b = input()
    list1 = b.split()
    for str in list1:
        list2.append(int(str))
    list2.sort()
    for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
        s = s + int(list2[i])
    final.append(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be an integer greater than 0, `num` is 0, `final` is a list containing the sum of all elements at even indices in `list2`, `s` is equal to the sum of all elements at even indices in `list2`, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all words in `list1` and must have at least one element, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string, `list1` is a list of words from `b` split by whitespace, `str` is the last word in `list1`, `i` is the last even index in `list2` or the length of `list2` if it is even.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be an integer greater than 1, `num` is 1, `final` is a list containing the value of `s`, `s` is the sum of all elements at even indices in `list2`, `list1` is a list of words from the user input `b` that must have at least one word that can be converted to an integer, `str` is the last word in `list1`, `i` is `len(list2) - 1` if `len(list2)` is odd, or `len(list2) - 2` if `len(list2)` is even, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all the words in `list1`, `a` is the user input, `b` is the user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be an integer greater than 2, `num` is 2, `final` is a list containing the values of `s` (which is the sum of all the elements at even indices in `list2`), `s` is the sum of all the elements at even indices in `list2`, `list1` is a list of strings resulting from splitting `b` by spaces, `i` is the last even index in `list2` (or `len(list2) - 1` if the length of `list2` is odd), `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all the strings in `list1`, `a` is the user input, `b` is the new user input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
