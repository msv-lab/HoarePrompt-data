### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `a` (which is not used in the logic) and then reads the space-separated integers `b`.
   - It converts the space-separated integers into a list of integers `list2`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `list2` is sorted in ascending order. This is crucial because the problem requires selecting pairs of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. By sorting the list, we ensure that the smallest elements are always selected first, which maximizes the score.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The function iterates over the sorted list `list2` in steps of 2, adding the elements at even indices to the score `s`. This is correct because the elements at even indices in a sorted list are the smaller elements of each pair when the list is divided into pairs.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the function prints the final scores for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Variable Naming**:
  - The variable `a` is read but not used, which is unnecessary and can be removed.
  - The variable `b` is used to store the input string of integers, but it can be directly split and converted to integers without the intermediate variable `list1`.

- **Type Conversion**:
  - The function converts `n` to an integer once, but it also converts `list2[i]` to an integer inside the loop, which is redundant since `list2` is already a list of integers.

### Correctness:
- The core logic of the function is correct. It sorts the list and sums the elements at even indices, which is the optimal way to maximize the score according to the problem description.
- The function handles multiple test cases correctly by reading the number of test cases and processing each one independently.

### Conclusion:
The function is correct in terms of its logic and output. However, there are some minor issues with variable naming and unnecessary type conversions that can be optimized.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
