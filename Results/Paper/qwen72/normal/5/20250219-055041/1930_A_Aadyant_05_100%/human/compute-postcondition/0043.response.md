Output State: **`n` must be an integer greater than 1, `num` is 1, `final` is 0, `s` is `int(list2[0]) + int(list2[2])`, `list1` is a list of words from the user input `b` that must have at least one word that can be converted to an integer, `str` is the last word in `list1`, `i` is 2, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all the words in `list1` and must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the user input, `b` is the user input.**

The value of `s` is updated to be the sum of the integer value of the first element in `list2` and the integer value of the third element in `list2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
