Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `arr` and its current value is 0, `pos` is increased by 1, `z_l` is increased by 1.** 

The value of `z_l` is incremented by 1, while the values of `arr`, `i`, and the fact that `pos` is increased by 1 remain unchanged.
