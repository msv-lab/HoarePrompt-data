Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `b_d`, and `ans` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration. If `i` == 0, `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_r` is decreased by 1 and `o_l` is increased by 1. `ans` is now equal to `pos`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to be equal to the current value of `pos`.
- The values of `arr`, `i`, `pos`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, and `b_d` remain unchanged from their previous states.
- The conditions for updating `z_r` and `o_r` and `o_l` based on the value of `i` still hold, but `ans` now holds the value of `pos`.
