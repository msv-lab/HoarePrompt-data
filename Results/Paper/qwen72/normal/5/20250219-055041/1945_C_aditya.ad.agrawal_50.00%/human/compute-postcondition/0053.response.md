The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decreased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 after the decrement.

State: **`pos` is equal to `n`. `z_l` is the count of zeros in the first `pos` elements of `arr`. `o_l` is the count of ones in the first `pos` elements of `arr`. `z_r` is 0. `o_r` is 0. `ans` is the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` are satisfied and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` is minimized. `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions are satisfied. `t` is greater than 0.**
