The only objects in the loop head are the list `arr` and the variable `i`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop progresses through the list `arr`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the next element in `arr`, and `pos` was increased by 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be the element following the current `i` in `arr`, and `pos` will be increased by 1 again.

Given that `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, and assuming the loop has not yet completed (i.e., there are more elements in `arr`), the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` is the next element in `arr` (the element following the current `i`).
- `pos` is increased by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

The conditions involving `o_r`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `z_l`, `b_d`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. They are part of the loop body and will be evaluated during the next iteration.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1. The conditions for `o_r`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `z_l`, `b_d`, and `ans` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.**
