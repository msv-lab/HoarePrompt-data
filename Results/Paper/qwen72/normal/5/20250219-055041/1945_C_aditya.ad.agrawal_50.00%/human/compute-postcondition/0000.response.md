Output State: **The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident's preference to live on the left side and '1' indicates a preference to live on the right side. The total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5. `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
