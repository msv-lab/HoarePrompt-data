Output State: **`pos` is equal to `n`, `z_l` is the count of zeros in the first `pos` elements of `arr`, `o_l` is the count of ones in the first `pos` elements of `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `ans` is the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` are satisfied and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` is minimized, `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions are satisfied, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of the corresponding character in `input_string`, `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the count of ones in `arr`.**
