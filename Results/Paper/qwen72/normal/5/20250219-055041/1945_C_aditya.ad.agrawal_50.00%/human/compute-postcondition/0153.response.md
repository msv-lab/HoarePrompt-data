Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `pos` is equal to the length of `arr` for each test case, `z_l` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o_l` is the count of ones in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `ans` is the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` were last met for each test case, `b_d` is the absolute difference between `n / 2` and the position where the conditions were last met for each test case, and `t` is 0.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed for all test cases:
- The variable `pos` will be equal to the length of the array `arr` for each test case, indicating that the loop has processed all elements of the array.
- `z_l` will be the total count of zeros in the array `arr` for each test case.
- `o_l` will be the total count of ones in the array `arr` for each test case.
- `z_r` and `o_r` will both be 0, as all elements have been processed.
- `ans` will hold the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` were last satisfied, and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` was minimized for each test case.
- `b_d` will be the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions were satisfied for each test case.
- The variable `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
