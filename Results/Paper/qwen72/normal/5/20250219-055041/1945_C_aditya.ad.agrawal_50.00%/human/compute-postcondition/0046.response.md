Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1. If `i` == 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1.***
