Output State: **The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3Â·10^5. `t` must be greater than 0. `n` is now an input integer. `input_string` is an input string. `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1). `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`. `o` is the count of ones in `arr`. `z_r` is equal to `z`. `o_r` is equal to `o`. `z_l` is 0. `o_l` is 0. `dist` is equal to `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0. `o_r` is less than `(z_r + o_r) / 2`. `b_d` is 30001.**

Explanation:
- The variable `b_d` is assigned the value 30001.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
