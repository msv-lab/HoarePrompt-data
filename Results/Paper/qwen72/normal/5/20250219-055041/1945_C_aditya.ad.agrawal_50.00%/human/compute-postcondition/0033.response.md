The value of `z_r` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `z_l` is increased by 1, `z_r` is decreased by 1.
