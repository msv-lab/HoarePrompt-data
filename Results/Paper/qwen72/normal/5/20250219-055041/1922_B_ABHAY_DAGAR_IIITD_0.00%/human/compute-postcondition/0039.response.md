Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least `n` integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes each integer from `num_list` as a key with its value representing the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least one key-value pair remaining, `total_count` is the sum of the previous `cnt` values plus the current `cnt`, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens`, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` updates the value of `res` by adding the result of the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.
- The value of `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens`, and `total_count` is the sum of the previous `cnt` values plus the current `cnt`.
- The expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` calculates the number of pairs that can be formed from `cnt` items, multiplied by `total_count`.
- The updated value of `res` is `res` plus the result of the expression.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for `res` being increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3 is not affected by this code snippet.
