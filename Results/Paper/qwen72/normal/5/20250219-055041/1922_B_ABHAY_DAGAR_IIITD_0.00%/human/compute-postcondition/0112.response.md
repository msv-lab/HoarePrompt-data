Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is 0, `x` is the last integer in the `num_list`, `n` is an input integer, `cnt` is the first value from `num_of_lens.values()`, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
