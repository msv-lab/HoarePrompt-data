Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least 2 integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes the first integer in `num_list` as a key with its value incremented by 1 if it was already in `num_of_lens`, or set to 1 if it was not in `num_of_lens`, `num_of_lens` now includes the second integer in `num_list` as a key with its value incremented by 1 if it was already in `num_of_lens`, or set to 1 if it was not in `num_of_lens`, `res` is the sum of the combinations of choosing 3 elements from each integer's count plus the sum of the products of choosing 2 elements from each integer's count and the total count of all processed elements, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, and `x` is the second integer in `num_list`.**
