Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the last integer in the new `num_list`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the `num_list` variable to a new list of integers provided by the input.
- The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, `x`, and `n`) are not directly affected by this code, but `x` is now the last integer in the new `num_list`.
