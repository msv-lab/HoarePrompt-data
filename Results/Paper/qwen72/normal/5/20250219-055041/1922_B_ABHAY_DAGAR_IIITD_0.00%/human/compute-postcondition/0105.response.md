Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `total_count` is 0, `x` is the last integer in the `num_list`, and `n` is an input integer.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all iterations, the `num_of_lens` dictionary will contain each unique integer from the `num_list` as a key, and the value associated with each key will be the count of how many times that integer appears in the `num_list`. The variable `x` will be the last integer in the `num_list`, and `total_count` will remain 0 since it is not modified within the loop. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, and `n`) will remain unchanged.
