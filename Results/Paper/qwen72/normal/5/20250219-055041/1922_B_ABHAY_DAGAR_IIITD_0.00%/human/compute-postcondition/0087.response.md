The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to iterate over the range defined by `test_cases`. The loop will execute again if there are more elements in the range to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case. Since `_` is not explicitly tracked, we can infer that the loop has just completed one iteration, so there must be at least one more test case for the loop to execute again.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`. `results` now contains the value of `res` appended to it.**
