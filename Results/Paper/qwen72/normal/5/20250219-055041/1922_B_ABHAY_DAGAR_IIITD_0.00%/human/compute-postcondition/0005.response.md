The only objects in the loop head are `x` and `num_list`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `num_list`. If `num_list` has at least one integer, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, and `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary. However, these states do not affect the execution of the loop directly.

For the loop to execute, `num_list` must have at least one integer, and `x` should be the first integer in `num_list`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `x` is the first integer in `num_list`**
