### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks, `n`, and the list of stick lengths, `num_list`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary, `num_of_lens`, to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - This is done by iterating through `num_list` and updating the count for each length in the dictionary.

3. **Calculating Combinations:**
   - The program initializes `res` to 0, which will store the number of valid triangles.
   - It also initializes `total_count` to 0, which will keep track of the total number of sticks processed so far.

4. **Combination Logic:**
   - For each unique stick length count, `cnt`, in `num_of_lens.values()`, the program checks:
     - If `cnt` is at least 3, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6} \) and adds this to `res`.
     - If `cnt` is at least 2, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} \times total_count = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \times total_count \) and adds this to `res`.
   - It then updates `total_count` by adding the current `cnt`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Triangle Inequality Theorem:**
  - For three sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick.
  - Given the lengths are powers of 2, the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if all three sticks have the same length. This is because \(2^a + 2^a = 2^{a+1}\), and \(2^a + 2^b < 2^c\) for any \(a, b, c\) where \(a \leq b < c\).

- **Combination Calculation:**
  - The program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} \).
  - It also correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} \times total_count \).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `cnt` is less than 3 by not adding any combinations to `res`.
  - It also handles the edge case where `cnt` is less than 2 by not adding any combinations to `res`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles with the given sticks. It correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
