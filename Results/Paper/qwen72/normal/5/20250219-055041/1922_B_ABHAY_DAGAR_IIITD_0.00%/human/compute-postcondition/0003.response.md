Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in the list `num_list`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
