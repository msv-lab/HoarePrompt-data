Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least 3 integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes the first, second, and third integers in `num_list` as keys with their values incremented appropriately, `res` is the sum of the combinations of choosing 3 elements from each integer's count plus the sum of the products of choosing 2 elements from each integer's count and the total count of all processed elements, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, and `x` is the third integer in `num_list`.**

Explanation:
- The code `num_of_lens[x] = 1` updates the dictionary `num_of_lens` by setting the value of the key `x` (which is the third integer in `num_list`) to 1.
- The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `num_list`, `res`, and `total_count`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state information about `num_of_lens` including the first and second integers in `num_list` as keys with their values incremented appropriately is still valid.
- The value of `x` is still the third integer in `num_list`.
- The value of `total_count` is still the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, which now includes the third integer with a count of 1.
