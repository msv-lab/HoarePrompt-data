Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `num_of_lens`, but the values of `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `num_list` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new state of `num_of_lens`.
