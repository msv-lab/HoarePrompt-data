Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least 2 integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes the first integer in `num_list` as a key with its value incremented by 1 if it was already in `num_of_lens`, or set to 1 if it was not in `num_of_lens`. If `x` (the second integer in `num_list`) is in `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1. `res` is the sum of the combinations of choosing 3 elements from each integer's count plus the sum of the products of choosing 2 elements from each integer's count and the total count of all processed elements, and `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**
