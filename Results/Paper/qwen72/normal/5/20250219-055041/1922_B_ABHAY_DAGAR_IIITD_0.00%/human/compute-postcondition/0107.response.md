Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `total_count` is 0, `x` is the last integer in the `num_list`, `n` is an input integer, `res` is 0.**

The code snippet `total_count = 0` reassigns the variable `total_count` to 0, which was already 0 in the initial state. Therefore, the state of `total_count` remains unchanged. The other variables and their values remain the same as in the initial state.
