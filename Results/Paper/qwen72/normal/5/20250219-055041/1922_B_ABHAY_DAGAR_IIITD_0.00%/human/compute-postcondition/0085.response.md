Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`. `res` is the sum of the combinations of choosing 3 elements from each integer's count (if the count is 3 or more) plus the sum of the products of the combinations of choosing 2 elements from each integer's count (if the count is 2 or more) and the cumulative `total_count` up to that point.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop:
- `total_count` will be the total number of elements in `num_list`.
- `res` will be the final result after processing all counts in `num_of_lens`. Specifically, `res` will be updated by adding the number of ways to choose 3 elements from each count (if the count is 3 or more) and the number of ways to choose 2 elements from each count (if the count is 2 or more) multiplied by the cumulative `total_count` up to that point.
