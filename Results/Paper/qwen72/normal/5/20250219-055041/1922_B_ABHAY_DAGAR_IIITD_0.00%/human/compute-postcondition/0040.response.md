Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least `n` integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes each integer from `num_list` as a key with its value representing the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least one key-value pair remaining, `total_count` is the sum of the previous `cnt` values plus the current `cnt`, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
