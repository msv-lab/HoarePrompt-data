The only objects in the loop head are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `num_of_lens` dictionary and the values it contains. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is the first value from `num_of_lens.values()`, and `num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num_of_lens` must have at least two key-value pairs. The next value of `cnt` will be the second value from `num_of_lens.values()`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is `cnt`, `x` is the last integer in the `num_list`, `n` is an input integer, and `cnt` is the second value from `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` which is 0. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
