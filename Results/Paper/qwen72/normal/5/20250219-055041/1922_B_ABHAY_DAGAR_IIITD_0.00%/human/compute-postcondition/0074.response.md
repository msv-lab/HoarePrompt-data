The code snippet `res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` updates the value of `res` based on the value of `cnt`. Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case.
   - `results` is a list containing the value of `res`.
   - `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input.
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`.
   - `num_of_lens` must have at least two key-value pairs.
   - `cnt` is the value of the second key in `num_of_lens`.
   - `total_count` is the value of the first key in `num_of_lens`.
   - `x` is the last integer in `num_list`.
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
   - If `cnt` is 2, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.
   - If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains 0.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The value of `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to it.
   - This update only occurs if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - If `cnt` is less than 3, `res` remains unchanged.

3. **Calculation**:
   - If `cnt` is 3 or more, the new value of `res` is `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
   - If `cnt` is less than 3, `res` remains the same.

4. **Output State**:
   - If `cnt` is 3 or more, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
   - If `cnt` is less than 3, `res` remains unchanged.
   - The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, `x`) are not affected.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` must have at least two key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the second key in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is the value of the first key in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`. If `cnt` is 3 or more, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If `cnt` is less than 3, `res` remains unchanged.**
