The code snippet updates the value of `res` by adding the result of the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to it. 

- `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `total_count` is 0.
- The expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` evaluates to 0 because `total_count` is 0.
- Therefore, `res` remains unchanged.

The other variables and conditions in the initial state are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least `n` integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes each integer from `num_list` as a key with its value representing the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is 0, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, and `res` remains unchanged.**
