Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 3 integers, `total_count` is 0, `x` is the third integer in the `num_list`, and `n` is an input integer. If `x` is in `num_of_lens`, `num_of_lens[x]` is 3. Otherwise, `num_of_lens[x]` is 1.***
