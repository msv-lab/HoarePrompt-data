Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `mid`. If the character at index `right` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is 1, `leftOne` is 0, and `rightZero` is the number of '0's in `s` minus 1. Otherwise, if the character at index `right` in `s` is not '0', then `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 1, and `rightOne` is the number of '1's in `s` minus 1. In both cases, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - n // 2 + 1) // 2`.***
