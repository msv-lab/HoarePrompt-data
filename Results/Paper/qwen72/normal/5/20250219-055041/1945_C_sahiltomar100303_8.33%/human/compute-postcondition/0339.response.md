Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is `left - 1` and must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid - 1` characters of `s` and must be less than `(left + 1) // 2` if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2 - 1`. If the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is now `leftZero - 1`, `rightZero` is now `rightZero + 1`, and `rightOne` remains unchanged. If the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is not '0', then `leftOne` is now `leftOne - 1`, `rightOne` is now `rightOne + 1`, and `rightZero` remains unchanged. In both cases, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`.**
