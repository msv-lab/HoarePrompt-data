Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`, `left` is equal to `mid`, `leftMove` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `left` is equal to `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at the position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus 1, and `tleftZero` and `trightZero` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1, `rightOne` is increased by 1, and `trightOne` is updated accordingly.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `left` is equal to `mid - 2` and greater than or equal to 0, `leftMove` is 0. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus 2, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus 2, and `tleftZero` and `trightZero` are updated accordingly. If `s[left - 1]` is not '0', `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus 1, `tleftZero` and `trightZero` are updated accordingly, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus 2, `rightOne` is increased by 2, and `trightOne` is updated accordingly.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 4, `s` is an input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `left` is equal to `mid - 3` and greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus 3, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus 3, and `tleftZero` and `trightZero` are updated accordingly. If `s[left - 1]` is not '0', `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus 2, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus 2, `tleftZero` and `trightZero` are updated accordingly, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, `rightOne` is increased by 3, and `trightOne` is updated accordingly.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
