Let's break down the initial state and determine the value of `right` that will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `s` is a new input string.
   - `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `leftMove` is 0.
   - `left` is 0.
   - `right` is `n`.
   - `right` is not equal to `n`.
   - `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`.
   - `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]`.
   - `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[:mid]`.
   - `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[:mid]`.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The statement `right` is `n` and `right` is not equal to `n` is contradictory. However, based on the initial state, `right` is explicitly set to `n`.
   - The value of `n` is an input integer greater than 0, so `right` will be equal to `n`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Despite the contradiction, the value of `right` is clearly defined as `n`.

Therefore, the `print(right)` statement will print the value of `n`.

Output: **n (where n is the input integer greater than 0)**
