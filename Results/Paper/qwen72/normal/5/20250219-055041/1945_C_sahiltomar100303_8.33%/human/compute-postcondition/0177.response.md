Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `mid + 1`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `n`, `rightOne` is `n // 2 + 1` or `n // 2`, `trightZero` is 0 or 1, `trightOne` is 2 or 1, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftZero` is the same as `leftZero` if `s[i]` is '0' for any `i` in the range `[0, mid)`, otherwise `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s` and `tleftOne` is the same as `leftOne`.**
