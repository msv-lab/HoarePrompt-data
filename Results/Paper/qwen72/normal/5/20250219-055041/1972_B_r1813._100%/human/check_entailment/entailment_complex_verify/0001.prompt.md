You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n with characters "U" and "D" representing the state of the coins.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        s = data[index + 1]
        
        index += 2
        
        count_u = s.count('U')
        
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is the initial value of `t`, `_` is `t-1`, `index` is `1 + 2 * t`, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * t - 1]`, `s` is the value of `data[2 * t]`, and `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `data[2 * t]`. If `count_u` was odd before, it remains odd. If `count_u` was even before, it remains even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters "U" and "D". It then checks if the number of "U" characters in `s` is odd. If the count is odd, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the variable `t` retaining its initial value, `_` being `t-1`, `index` being `1 + 2 * t`, `n` being the last processed integer, `s` being the last processed string, and `count_u` being the count of "U" characters in the last processed string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach for handling multiple test cases in a single input.
   - The first element of the list `data` is the number of test cases `t`.
   - The program then iterates over each test case, reading the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the coin states.

2. **Game Logic**:
   - The key to determining the winner is the number of facing-up coins (`U`).
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always have a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob. This is because removing one facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins (which are either both facing down or one facing up and one facing down) will always result in an even number of facing-up coins.
   - Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always have a move that leaves an odd number of facing-up coins for Alice. This is because removing one facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins will always result in an odd number of facing-up coins.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" if the number of facing-up coins is odd, indicating that Alice will win.
   - It prints "NO" if the number of facing-up coins is even, indicating that Bob will win.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- It correctly counts the number of facing-up coins (`U`).
- It correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge case where there are no facing-up coins correctly by printing "NO" (since the player who cannot make a move loses).
- The program also handles the case where there is only one coin correctly by printing "NO" (since the game ends immediately if there is only one coin and it is facing up).

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the rules of the game as described. It correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
