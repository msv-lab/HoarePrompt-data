Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function is now set to read input from `sys.stdin`. The initial state variables `t` is assigned the integer value of the first element in the list `data`, and the list of tuples are not affected. `data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces. `index` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    s = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    count_u = s.count('U')
    if count_u % 2 == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `index` is 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is the value of `data[2]`, and `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `s`. If `count_u` is odd, the current value of `count_u` remains odd. If `count_u` is even, the current value of `count_u` remains even.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `index` is 5, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `s` is the value of `data[4]`, and `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `s`. If `count_u` was odd before, it remains odd. If `count_u` was even before, it remains even.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `index` is 7, `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`, `s` is the value of `data[6]`, and `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `data[6]`. If `count_u` was odd before, it remains odd. If `count_u` was even before, it remains even.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
