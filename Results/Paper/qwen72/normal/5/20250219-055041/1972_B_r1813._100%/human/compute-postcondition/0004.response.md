The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The initial state variables `t` is assigned the integer value of the first element in the list `data`, and `index` is 1. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `index` is 1**
