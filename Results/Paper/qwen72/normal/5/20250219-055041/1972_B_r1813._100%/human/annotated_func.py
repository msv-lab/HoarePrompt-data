#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n with characters "U" and "D" representing the state of the coins.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        s = data[index + 1]
        
        index += 2
        
        count_u = s.count('U')
        
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is the initial value of `t`, `_` is `t-1`, `index` is `1 + 2 * t`, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * t - 1]`, `s` is the value of `data[2 * t]`, and `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `data[2 * t]`. If `count_u` was odd before, it remains odd. If `count_u` was even before, it remains even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters "U" and "D". It then checks if the number of "U" characters in `s` is odd. If the count is odd, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the variable `t` retaining its initial value, `_` being `t-1`, `index` being `1 + 2 * t`, `n` being the last processed integer, `s` being the last processed string, and `count_u` being the count of "U" characters in the last processed string.
