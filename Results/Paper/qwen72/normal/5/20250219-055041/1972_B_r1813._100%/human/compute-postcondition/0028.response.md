Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 2.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `index` is 7.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`.
   - `s` is the value of `data[6]`.
   - `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `data[6]`.
   - If `count_u` was odd before, it remains odd.
   - If `count_u` was even before, it remains even.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
   - The values of `t`, `_`, `index`, `n`, `s`, and `count_u` are not directly used in the print statement.
   - The initial state provides context for these variables, but they do not affect the output of the print statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
