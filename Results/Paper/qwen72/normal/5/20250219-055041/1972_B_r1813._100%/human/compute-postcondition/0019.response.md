Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `index` is 5.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`.
   - `s` is the value of `data[4]`.
   - `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `s`.
   - If `count_u` was odd before, it remains odd. If `count_u` was even before, it remains even.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides information about various variables and their conditions, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the output is independent of the values of `t`, `_`, `index`, `n`, `s`, and `count_u`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **YES**
