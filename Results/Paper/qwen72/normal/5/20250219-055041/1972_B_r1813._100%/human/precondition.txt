The function `main` does not take any parameters, but it is expected to read input from stdin. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case is described by two lines: the first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n, consisting only of "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins (facing up or down).
