### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases `t` from the first element of the list.
   - It iterates over each test case, extracting the integer `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - The program counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.
   - It then checks if the count of 'U' coins is odd or even.
   - If the count is odd, it prints "YES" (Alice wins).
   - If the count is even, it prints "NO" (Bob wins).

3. **Optimal Play:**
   - The problem states that both players play optimally. The key insight here is that the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always ensure that she makes the last move, thus winning the game.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always ensure that he makes the last move, thus winning the game.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - If there are no facing-up coins, the player whose turn it is loses.
     - If there is only one coin left, no coins will be flipped, and the player whose turn it is wins if the coin is facing up.
     - If there are only two coins left, one will be removed and the other won't be flipped, ensuring that the player whose turn it is wins if the remaining coin is facing up.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints "YES" or "NO" for each test case, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. It handles all the edge cases and follows the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
