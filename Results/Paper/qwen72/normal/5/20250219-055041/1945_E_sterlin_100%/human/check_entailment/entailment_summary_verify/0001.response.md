### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search.
   - We can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation before applying the binary search.
   - The binary search algorithm is slightly different from the standard one, with `l` starting at 1 and `r` at `n + 1`.

2. **Binary Search on a Permutation:**
   - The binary search algorithm in the problem will always end with `l` being the index where `x` should be if the array were sorted.
   - The goal is to place `x` in a position that will be found by the binary search.

3. **Swapping Elements:**
   - We need to ensure that `x` is in a position that will be found by the binary search.
   - If `x` is already in the correct position, no swaps are needed.
   - If `x` is not in the correct position, we can swap it into the correct position using at most 2 swaps.

4. **Algorithm to Solve the Problem:**
   - For each test case, we need to find the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - We then need to ensure that `x` is in a position that will be found by the binary search.
   - If `x` is not in the correct position, we can swap it into the correct position using at most 2 swaps.

5. **Correctness of the Provided Program:**
   - The provided program defines several functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) to read input.
   - However, the program does not contain any logic to solve the problem. It only reads input and does not perform any swaps or binary search.
   - The function `func_5` reads a line of input and returns a list of strings, but this is not sufficient to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. It only reads input and does not perform the necessary swaps or binary search to find the number `x` in the permutation.

Final: **False**
