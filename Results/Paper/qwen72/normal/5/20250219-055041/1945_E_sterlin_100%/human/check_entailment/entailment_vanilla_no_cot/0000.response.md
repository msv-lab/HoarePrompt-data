Correctness: **False**

The provided program only includes function definitions that handle input operations but does not contain any logic to solve the problem described. Specifically, it does not include the binary search algorithm, nor does it include the logic to perform the required swaps to ensure the binary search will find the correct element. The program is incomplete and does not address the problem requirements.
