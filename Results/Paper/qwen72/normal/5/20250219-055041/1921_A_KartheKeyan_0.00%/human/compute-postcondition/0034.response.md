Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `n - 1` (where `n` must be greater than 1), `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the input integers, `p1` and `p2` are undefined.**

The `coord` list is now sorted based on the tuples it contains. The sorting is done in ascending order, first by the `x` value, and then by the `y` value if the `x` values are the same. The other variables remain unchanged.
