Output State: **`i` is 3, `coord` is a sorted list with 7 elements, `p1` is now `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the input integers, `n` is `n - 2` (where `n` must be greater than or equal to 2).**

Explanation:
- The value of `p1` is updated to `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`, which calculates the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second elements of the `coord` list.
- The values of `i`, `coord`, `p2`, `res`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged.
