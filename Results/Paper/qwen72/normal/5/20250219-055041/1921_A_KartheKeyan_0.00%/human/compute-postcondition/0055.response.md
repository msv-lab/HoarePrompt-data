Output State: **`i` is 3, `coord` is a sorted list with 7 elements, `p1` is now `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is now `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The list `coord` remains a sorted list with 7 elements.
- The value of `p1` is still `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`.
- The value of `p2` is calculated as `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`, which represents the squared Euclidean distance between the coordinates at indices 2 and 3 in the `coord` list.
