Output State: **`i` is 2, `coord` is a list with at least 7 elements, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the input integers, `n` is `n - 2` (where `n` must be greater than or equal to 2).**

The code `coord.append((x, y))` adds a new tuple `(x, y)` to the end of the list `coord`, increasing its length by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions specified in the initial state are still valid. The value of `n` is still `n - 2`, and `i` remains 2. The values of `p1` and `p2` are not affected by this operation.
