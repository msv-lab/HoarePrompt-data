The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit, which is 4. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0. However, `n` is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, so for the next iteration, `i` will be 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 4.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are input integers.**
