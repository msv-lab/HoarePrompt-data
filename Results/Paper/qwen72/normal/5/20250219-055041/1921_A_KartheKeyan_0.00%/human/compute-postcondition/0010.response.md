Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are input integers.**

The code appends the tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`, which already contains the tuple `(x, y)`. Therefore, `coord` now contains two identical tuples `(x, y)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
