The code snippet `n -= 1` decrements the value of `n` by 1. However, `n` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its new value. The other variables (`i`, `coord`, `p1`, `p2`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `coord` is a sorted list with 7 elements, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, `n` is decreased by 1.**
