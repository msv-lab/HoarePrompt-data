Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is `n - 1` (where `n` must be greater than 1), `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the input integers, `p1` and `p2` are undefined because `coord` now contains two elements.**

The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and converts them to integers, assigning them to `x` and `y`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `coord`, and `res`) remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `y` are now the input integers. `p1` and `p2` are still undefined as they were not affected by the code.
