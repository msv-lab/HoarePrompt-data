Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square for all potential cases. Specifically, the calculation of the area is incorrect. The area of a square is the side length squared, but the program calculates the product of the distances between two pairs of points, which is not necessarily the side length of the square.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```
The correct area of the square is 9 (since the side length is 3, and 3^2 = 9). However, the program calculates the distances between the points (1, 2) and (4, 5), and (1, 5) and (4, 2), which are not the side lengths of the square. This leads to an incorrect area calculation.

A correct approach would be to identify the side length of the square by finding the minimum distance between the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates, and then squaring that distance to get the area.
