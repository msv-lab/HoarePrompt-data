Output State: **`i` is 0, `coord` is a list with at least 5 elements (the original 4 elements plus the new element `(x, y)`), `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the input integers, `n` is `n - 2` (where `n` must be greater than or equal to 2).**
