The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is `n - 1` (where `n` must be greater than 0). For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0 after the last iteration.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `n - 1` (where `n` must be greater than 1), `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `x` and `y` are input integers, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second tuples in `coord`, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`.**
