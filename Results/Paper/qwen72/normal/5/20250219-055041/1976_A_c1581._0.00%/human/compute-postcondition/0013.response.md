Output State: **`password` is a string of length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the third character of `password`, `digits` is a list containing the first, second, and third characters of `password`, and `letters` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `digits.append(char)` adds the third character of `password` to the `digits` list. Since the initial state specifies that if the third character of `password` is a digit, `digits` already contains the first and second characters of `password`, after appending `char`, `digits` now contains the first, second, and third characters. The `letters` list remains empty.
