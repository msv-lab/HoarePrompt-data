Output State: **`password` is a string of length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character of `password`, `last_digit_index` is 2.** 

The code snippet sets `last_digit_index` to the value of `i`, which is 2. The initial state specifies that if `char` (the third character of `password`) is a digit, `last_digit_index` should be set to 2, which is exactly what the code does. If `char` is not a digit and `last_digit_index` is not -1, the program returns 'NO', but since `last_digit_index` is now 2, this condition is not checked in this snippet. Therefore, the program does not return anything in this step. The values of `password`, `i`, and `char` remain unchanged.
