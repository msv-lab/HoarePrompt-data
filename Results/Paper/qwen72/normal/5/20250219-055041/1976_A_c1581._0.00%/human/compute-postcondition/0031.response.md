The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `char`, and the string `password`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `password` and the current value of `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `char` is the second character of `password`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The `char` variable will then be set to the third character of `password`.

The length of `password` is `n`, and since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`password` is a string of length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is set to 2. If `char` is not a digit and `last_digit_index` is not -1, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.**
