Postcondition: ***`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is set to 1. If `char` is not a digit and `last_digit_index` is not -1, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.***
