The code `digits.append(char)` adds the second character of `password` to the `digits` list. 

- If `char` is a digit, `digits` initially contains the first character of `password`, and `letters` is an empty list. After the code executes, `digits` will contain both the first and second characters of `password`.
- If `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is initially an empty list, and `letters` contains the first character of `password`. Since `char` is a letter, the code will not change the state of the variables, and `digits` will remain an empty list.

Output State: **If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first and second characters of `password`, and `letters` is an empty list. If `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is an empty list, and `letters` is a list containing the first character of `password`. `password` is a string of length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and `char` is the second character of `password`.**
