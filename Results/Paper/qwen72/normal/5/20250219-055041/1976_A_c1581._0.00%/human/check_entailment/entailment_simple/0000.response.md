Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list. It then processes each test case by extracting the length `n` and the password string from the list. This is a valid approach for handling the input.

2. **Character Separation**: The program separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`. This is done correctly by checking if each character is a digit using `char.isdigit()`.

3. **Digit After Letter Check**: The program checks if any digit appears after a letter. It does this by maintaining a `last_digit_index` variable, which is updated to the current index whenever a digit is encountered. If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not -1), the function returns 'NO'. This correctly enforces the rule that no digit should come after a letter.

4. **Sorting Check**: The program checks if the `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order. It does this by comparing the lists to their sorted versions. If either list is not sorted, the function returns 'NO'. This correctly enforces the rules that all digits and all letters should be sorted.

5. **Final Return**: If all checks pass, the function returns 'YES'. This is the correct behavior for a valid password.

Each step in the program is logically sound and correctly implements the rules specified in the problem description. The program handles the input and output as required, and the checks for the password conditions are implemented correctly.

Correctness: **True**
