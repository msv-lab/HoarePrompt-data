Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes each test case by extracting the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Character Classification**: The function `func_1` classifies each character in the password as either a digit or a letter and appends them to separate lists (`digits` and `letters`).

3. **Digit After Letter Check**: The program checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter. It does this by keeping track of the last index where a digit was found. If a letter is found after a digit, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Sorting Check**: The program checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order. It does this by comparing the lists of digits and letters with their sorted versions.

5. **Output**: The program collects the results of each test case and prints them in the required format.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly, ensuring that it meets all the conditions specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
