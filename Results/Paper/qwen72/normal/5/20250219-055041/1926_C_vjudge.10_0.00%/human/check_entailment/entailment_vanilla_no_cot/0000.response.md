Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

1. **Input Handling:** The program reads the number of test cases, `N`, correctly. However, it accumulates the sums of all test cases into a single variable `soma` and prints it only once at the end. This is incorrect because the output should be the sum for each test case separately.

2. **Range Issue:** The inner loop uses `range(n)`, which generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`. However, the problem description specifies that the numbers should be from 1 to `n` inclusive. Therefore, the loop should use `range(1, n+1)`.

3. **Output Formatting:** The program should print the sum for each test case on a separate line, but it only prints a single sum at the end.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

This version correctly handles each test case separately and prints the sum for each test case on a new line. Additionally, it uses the correct range from 1 to `n` inclusive.
