### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a string `s` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - Each `+` in the string corresponds to a value of `1` in the array `a`, and each `-` corresponds to a value of `-1`.
   - The goal is to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `expression`.
   - It then splits the string `expression` by the character `-` to get parts.
   - The `result_length` is calculated as the sum of the lengths of these parts.
   - The function `func_1` is called with `expression` and `result_length`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes `count` and `balance` to `0`.
   - It iterates through each character in the `expression`.
   - If the character is `+`, it increments `balance` by `1`.
   - If the character is `-`, it decrements `balance` by `1`.
   - If at any point `balance` becomes negative, it increments `count` by `1` and resets `balance` to `0`.
   - Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`.

4. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is designed to count the number of times the balance becomes negative and reset it.
   - The `count` variable keeps track of the number of subarrays needed to keep the balance non-negative.
   - The expression `balance > 0` checks if there is any remaining positive balance after the loop, which would indicate an additional subarray is needed.

5. **Checking the Output:**
   - For the first test case `+`, the balance is `1` and `count` is `0`. The output is `0 + (1 > 0) = 1`, which is correct.
   - For the second test case `-----`, the balance becomes negative five times, so `count` is `5`. The output is `5 + (0 > 0) = 5`, which is correct.
   - For the third test case `+-+-+-`, the balance alternates between `1` and `0`, and `count` remains `0`. The output is `0 + (0 > 0) = 0`, which is correct.
   - For the fourth test case `--+++++++`, the balance becomes negative twice, so `count` is `2`. The remaining balance is `7`, so the output is `2 + (7 > 0) = 3`, but the correct output should be `4`. This indicates a potential issue.
   - For the fifth test case `+---++++-+++++---++-`, the balance becomes negative multiple times, and the final balance is positive, but the exact count and balance need to be verified.

6. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case where the balance is positive but not zero. It should consider the length of the subarrays and the sum of the elements to calculate the penalty correctly.
   - The function only counts the number of times the balance goes below zero and adds one if the final balance is positive. This approach does not account for the actual penalty calculation, which involves the sum of the subarrays and their lengths.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty for all cases, especially when the balance is positive but not zero. The logic needs to be adjusted to consider the length of subarrays and the sum of elements more accurately.

Final: **False**
