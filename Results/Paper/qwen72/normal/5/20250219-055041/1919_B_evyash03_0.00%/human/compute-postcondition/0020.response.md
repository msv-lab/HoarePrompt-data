Output State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` (1 ≤ `length` ≤ 5000) consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `char` is the second character in `expression` (either '+' or '-'), `balance` is 0, `count` is 1.** 

The initial state indicates that `expression` is a string of a specified length, and `char` is the second character in `expression`. The code snippet sets `balance` to 0 and increments `count` by 1. The value of `char` and the length of `expression` remain unchanged.
