Output State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` (1 ≤ `length` ≤ 5000) consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `char` is the first character in `expression`, `count` is 1, and `balance` is -1.** 

The value of `count` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables (`expression`, `char`, and `balance`) remain unchanged.
