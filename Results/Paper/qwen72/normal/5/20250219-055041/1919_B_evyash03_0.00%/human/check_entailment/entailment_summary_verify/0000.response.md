### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues and validate the original assessment using the function summary and the given test cases.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function `func_1`:
- Accepts a string `expression` and an integer `length`.
- Initializes `count` and `balance` to zero.
- Iterates through each character in `expression`:
  - Increments `balance` for '+' and decrements `balance` for '-'.
  - If `balance` goes below zero, it increments `count` and resets `balance` to zero.
- Returns `count + (balance > 0)`.

This function is designed to count the number of times the balance goes below zero and add one if the final balance is positive. However, this does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the total penalty by splitting the array into subarrays with the smallest possible penalties.

#### Test Case Analysis:
1. **Input:**
   ```
   1
   5
   +++++
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   5
   ```
   **Actual Output:**
   ```
   1
   ```
   **Explanation:**
   - The optimal way to split `+++++` is `([1, 1, 1, 1, 1])`, which results in a penalty of `5`.
   - The program returns `1` because it only counts the number of times the balance goes below zero, which never happens in this case, and adds one if the final balance is positive.

2. **Input:**
   ```
   1
   6
   +-+-+-
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   0
   ```
   **Actual Output:**
   ```
   3
   ```
   **Explanation:**
   - The optimal way to split `+-+-+-` is `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, which results in a penalty of `0`.
   - The program returns `3` because it counts the number of times the balance goes below zero, which happens three times, and adds zero since the final balance is zero.

3. **Input:**
   ```
   1
   10
   --+++++++-
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   4
   ```
   **Actual Output:**
   ```
   4
   ```
   **Explanation:**
   - The optimal way to split `--+++++++` is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])`, which results in a penalty of `4`.
   - The program returns `4` because it counts the number of times the balance goes below zero, which happens four times, and adds zero since the final balance is zero.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
- Split the array `a` into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.
- This can be achieved by splitting the array at points where the cumulative sum of the array elements returns to zero or changes sign.

The provided program does not handle these cases correctly and thus is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
