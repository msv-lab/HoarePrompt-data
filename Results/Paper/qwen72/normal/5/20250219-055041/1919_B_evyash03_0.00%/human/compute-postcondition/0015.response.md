The value of `balance` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `expression` is a string of length `length` (1 ≤ `length` ≤ 5000) consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `char` is the second character in `expression`, `balance` is increased by 1.
