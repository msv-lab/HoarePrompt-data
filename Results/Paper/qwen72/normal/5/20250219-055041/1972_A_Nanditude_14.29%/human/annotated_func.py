#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list containing two sublists, where the first sublist represents the array a of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) with elements (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9) and the second sublist represents the array b of length n (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9). Both a and b are sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a list containing the two sublists from `arr`, sorted in reverse order. Since both `a` and `b` are already sorted in non-decreasing order, the returned list will have the second sublist `b` first and the first sublist `a` second.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` containing two sublists, `a` and `b`, both of which are sorted in non-decreasing order. It returns a new list where the sublists are sorted in reverse order, meaning the sublist `b` will come first, followed by the sublist `a`. The elements within each sublist remain in their original order.
