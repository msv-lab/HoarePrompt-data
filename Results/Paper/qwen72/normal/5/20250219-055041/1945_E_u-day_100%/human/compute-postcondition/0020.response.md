Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` or is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, `low` is 0, `high` is `n // 2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `st` is a set containing the value `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, and `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `high` is updated to `mid`, which is `n // 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
