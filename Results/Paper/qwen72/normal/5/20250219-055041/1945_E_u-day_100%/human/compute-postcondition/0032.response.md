Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` or is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, `low` is 0 if `arr[mid] > k` or `(low + high) // 2` otherwise, `high` is `(low + high) // 2` if `arr[mid] > k` or `n` otherwise, `st` is a set containing the values `n // 2`, `mid`, and the new `mid`, `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, and `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mid` is added to the set `st`.
- The set `st` now contains the values `n // 2` and the previous value of `mid`.
- The new value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, which is also added to the set `st`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `pos`, `low`, `high`) remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
