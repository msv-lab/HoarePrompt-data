Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` as returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is an integer that will be the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found.**

Explanation:
- `n` and `k` are still updated to the values returned by `func_1()`.
- `arr` is now a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, as returned by `func_2()`.
- The value of `pos` remains unchanged and is still an integer that will be the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found.
