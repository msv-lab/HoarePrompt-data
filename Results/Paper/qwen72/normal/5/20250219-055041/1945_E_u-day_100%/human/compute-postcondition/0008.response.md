Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `pos` is 1.**

The value of `pos` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The condition about the first element of the list `arr` being equal to `k` does not affect the current code snippet, so the output state reflects the updated value of `pos` and retains the initial values of `n` and `i`.
