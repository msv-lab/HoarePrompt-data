You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, and pos is an integer that will be the index of k in arr if k is found.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` or is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop, and `mid` is the last midpoint calculated before the loop terminates.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: (low + 1, pos + 1) (where `low + 1` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than `k`, and `pos + 1` is 0 if `k` is not found in `arr`, or the index of the first occurrence of `k` plus one if `k` is found)
    #State: *`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` or is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop, and `mid` is the last midpoint calculated before the loop terminates. If `arr[low] == k`, then `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k` and `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (an integer such that 1 <= k <= n), `arr` (a list of integers representing a permutation of size n), and `pos` (an integer). It returns the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, it returns a specific value indicating that `k` is not in `arr`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
