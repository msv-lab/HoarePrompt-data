Functionality: ** The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It internally calls `func_1` to obtain `n` and `k`, and `func_2` to obtain a list `arr` of integers representing a permutation of size `n`. The function then searches for the integer `k` in the list `arr`. If `k` is found, `pos` is set to the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. If `k` is not found, `pos` remains -1. The function also performs a binary search to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`. If `k` is found at `arr[low]`, the function prints 0. If `k` is not found, the function prints 1 and then prints the values `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, where `low + 1` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than `k`, and `pos + 1` is 0 if `k` is not found in `arr` or the index of the first occurrence of `k` plus one if `k` is found. **
