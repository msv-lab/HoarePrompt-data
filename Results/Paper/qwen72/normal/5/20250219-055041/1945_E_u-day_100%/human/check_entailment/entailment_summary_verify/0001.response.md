### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search, but the permutation is not sorted.
   - We are allowed to perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation before running the binary search.
   - The goal is to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

2. **Binary Search in a Permutation:**
   - Binary search works correctly only on sorted arrays. However, the problem states that we can perform up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work.
   - The binary search algorithm provided in the program is correct for a sorted array, but it assumes the array is sorted.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation `arr`.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` for the binary search.
   - It runs the binary search loop, updating `low` and `high` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` with `x`.
   - After the loop, it checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `x`.
   - If `arr[low]` is equal to `x`, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`, it prints `1` and the indices to swap `low` and `pos`.

4. **Correctness of the Binary Search:**
   - The binary search is implemented correctly, but it assumes the array is sorted.
   - Since the array is a permutation, it is not sorted, and the binary search may not find the correct position.

5. **Swapping to Fix the Binary Search:**
   - The program only swaps once if `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`.
   - This single swap might not always be sufficient to make the binary search work correctly, especially if the permutation is far from being sorted.
   - However, the problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient to make the binary search work correctly. The program does not take advantage of this guarantee and only performs one swap.

6. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the test case `6 3` with permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the program correctly identifies that no swaps are needed.
   - For the test case `6 5` with permutation `[3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]`, the program might not correctly identify the position of `5` after a single swap.
   - For the test case `5 1` with permutation `[3, 5, 4, 2, 1]`, the program might not correctly identify the position of `1` after a single swap.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always correctly handle the permutation to ensure that the binary search will find the correct position of `x`. Specifically, it only performs one swap, which might not be sufficient to make the binary search work correctly in all cases. The problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, but the program does not take advantage of this guarantee. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
