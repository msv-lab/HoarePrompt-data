Output State: **`u` and `v` are now in the same connected component, `dsu` has updated the union of `u` and `v` with the weight `w`, `parent_u` is the same as `parent_v` after the union, `node_u` is set to `u`, `node_v` is set to `v`, and `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`; otherwise, `_min_edge` remains unchanged. `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `graph[u]` now contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements, `graph[v]` now contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w` and must have at least 2 tuples, `i` is `m-2`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements.**
