The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `test_cases`. The loop will execute based on the value of `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be greater than 0. Since `_` is a placeholder variable and does not affect the loop's execution, it does not need to be adjusted. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `test_cases` is greater than 0.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
