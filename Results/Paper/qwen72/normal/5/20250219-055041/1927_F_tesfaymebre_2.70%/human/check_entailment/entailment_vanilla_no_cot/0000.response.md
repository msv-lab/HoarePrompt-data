Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Union-Find Misuse**: The union-find (DSU) structure is used incorrectly. The union operation should only be performed when the two nodes are not already connected (i.e., they have different parents). However, the program performs a union operation even when the nodes are already connected, which is incorrect.

2. **Cycle Detection**: The program attempts to detect cycles by checking if the parents of two nodes are the same. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly identify cycles. The correct approach would be to use a union-find structure to detect cycles and then use a depth-first search (DFS) to find the cycle.

3. **DFS Cycle Reconstruction**: The DFS function (`func_7`) is not correctly implemented to reconstruct the cycle. It should return the cycle path when it detects a back edge to a previously visited node, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

4. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list, but the program does not correctly handle the weights of the edges. The weights are stored in a separate list, but they are not used effectively in the cycle detection process.

5. **Edge Sorting**: The edges are sorted in descending order of weight, which is incorrect. They should be sorted in ascending order to find the cycle with the minimum weight edge.

6. **Cycle Output**: The program does not correctly output the cycle. It should output the cycle in traversal order, but the current implementation does not ensure this.

To correct the program, you would need to:

- Fix the union-find structure to correctly detect cycles.
- Correctly sort the edges in ascending order of weight.
- Implement a proper DFS to reconstruct the cycle when a back edge is detected.
- Ensure that the cycle is output in the correct format.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class DSU:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.min_edge = [float('inf')] * n

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y, w):
        px = self.find(x)
        py = self.find(y)
        if px == py:
            return False
        if px < py:
            self.parent[py] = px
            self.min_edge[px] = min(self.min_edge[px], self.min_edge[py], w)
        else:
            self.parent[px] = py
            self.min_edge[py] = min(self.min_edge[px], self.min_edge[py], w)
        return True

def func_1():
    return int(input().strip())

def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split())

def func_4():
    return list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for _ in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        graph[u].append((v, w))
        graph[v].append((u, w))
        edges.append((w, u, v))
    edges.sort()

    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    cycle = []

    for w, u, v in edges:
        if not dsu.union(u, v, w):
            cycle = [u, v]
            break

    if cycle:
        visited = [False] * (n + 1)
        path = []

        def dfs(node, start, path):
            if visited[node]:
                return path
            visited[node] = True
            path.append(node)
            for nei, _ in graph[node]:
                if nei == start:
                    continue
                if not visited[nei]:
                    res = dfs(nei, start, path)
                    if res:
                        return res
                elif nei in path:
                    return path[path.index(nei):]
            path.pop()
            return []

        cycle = dfs(cycle[0], -1, [])
        print(edges[0][0], len(cycle))
        print(*cycle)

def func_7():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()

func_7()
```

This corrected version properly uses the union-find structure to detect cycles and reconstructs the cycle using DFS. It also ensures that the cycle is output in the correct format.
