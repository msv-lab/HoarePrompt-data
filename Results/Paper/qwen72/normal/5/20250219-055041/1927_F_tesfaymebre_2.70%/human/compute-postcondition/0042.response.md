Output State: **`u` and `v` are now in the same connected component, `node_u` is set to `u`, `node_v` is set to `v`, `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, `graph[u]` still contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements, `graph[v]` still contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements, `edges` is still a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w`, `i` is `m-2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` as determined by `dsu.find(u)`, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` as determined by `dsu.find(v)`.**

The code snippet `node_u = u` reassigns the variable `node_u` to the value of `u`. Since `node_u` was already set to `u` in the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `node_u`. Therefore, all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
