### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` to read input. These functions are designed to handle different types of input lines, such as single integers, lists of integers, and lists of strings.
   - The main function `func_6` reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, then constructs the graph and the list of edges. This part is correct.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The graph is represented using a `defaultdict` of lists, where each key is a vertex and the value is a list of adjacent vertices.
   - The edges are stored in a list of tuples `(w, u, v)`, where `w` is the weight of the edge between vertices `u` and `v`. This part is correct.

3. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight. This is incorrect. The edges should be sorted in ascending order to find the lightest edge in a cycle. Sorting in descending order would prioritize heavier edges, which is not what we want.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - A `DSU` (Disjoint Set Union) data structure is used to manage the connected components of the graph.
   - The `DSU` class is not explicitly defined in the provided code, but it is assumed to have methods `find` and `union` to manage the components and their minimum edge weights.
   - The condition `if parent_u == parent_v` is used to detect a cycle. However, the current implementation adds the edge to the component even if it doesn't form a cycle, which is incorrect. The edge should only be added if it forms a cycle.

5. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and uses the `DSU` to check if adding an edge would form a cycle.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., both vertices of the edge are in the same component), the edge is added to the component, and the minimum edge weight in the cycle is updated.
   - The current implementation adds the edge to the component even if it doesn't form a cycle, which is a logical error.

6. **DFS for Cycle**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to find the vertices in the cycle starting from the vertex `node_u`.
   - The function uses a `colors` array to keep track of the visited status of each vertex. A vertex is marked as `1` when it is being visited and `2` when the visit is complete.
   - The function should return the cycle path when a cycle is detected, but the current implementation may return incorrect paths because it does not properly handle the cycle detection logic.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect. The edge sorting should be in ascending order, and the cycle detection logic in the `DSU` should be fixed to only add edges that form cycles. Additionally, the `dfs` function should correctly handle the cycle detection and return the correct path.

Final: **False**
