To determine what will be printed by the `print(*res)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `colors` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.
   - `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration.
   - `graph[u]` contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements.
   - `graph[v]` contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements.
   - `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration.
   - `dsu` is a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) object initialized with `n + 1` elements.
   - `node_u` and `node_v` are the last nodes that were unioned.
   - `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight among all the edges that were unioned.
   - `res` is the result of the `dfs` function called with `node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list.

2. **Understanding the `dfs` function:**
   - The `dfs` function is typically used to perform a depth-first search on a graph.
   - It is called with `node_u`, `-1` (which is likely the parent node), and an empty list (which is likely used to store the result of the traversal).

3. **What `res` might contain:**
   - The `dfs` function will traverse the graph starting from `node_u` and return a list of nodes or some other result based on the traversal.
   - Since `node_u` and `node_v` are the last nodes that were unioned, the `dfs` function will likely explore the connected component that includes `node_u` and `node_v`.

4. **Output of `print(*res)`:**
   - The `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of the list `res` separated by spaces.
   - The exact content of `res` depends on the implementation of the `dfs` function, but it will likely be a list of nodes that are part of the connected component starting from `node_u`.

Given the initial state and the typical behavior of a `dfs` function, the output will be the nodes visited during the depth-first search starting from `node_u`. Since `node_u` and `node_v` are connected, the `dfs` function will likely include both `node_u` and `node_v` in the result.

Output: **[nodes visited in the dfs traversal starting from node_u, including node_u and node_v] (where the exact nodes depend on the graph structure and the implementation of the dfs function)**
