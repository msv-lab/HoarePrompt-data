The only objects in the loop head are `w`, `u`, and `v` from the `edges` list, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `edges` list. If the list has at least one more tuple, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w` and must have at least 2 tuples, `i` is `m-2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `edges` must have at least one more tuple, making it at least 3 tuples in total (since `m` is at least 3 and `i` is `m-2`). Therefore, the next tuple to be processed is the second tuple in the list (since `i` is `m-2` and `m` is at least 3, the next tuple is the one at index `m-3`).

State: **`u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `graph[u]` contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements, `graph[v]` contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w` and must have at least 3 tuples, `i` is `m-3`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` as determined by `dsu.find(u)`, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` as determined by `dsu.find(v)`, `node_u` is set to `u`, `node_v` is set to `v`, and `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`; otherwise, `_min_edge` remains unchanged.**
