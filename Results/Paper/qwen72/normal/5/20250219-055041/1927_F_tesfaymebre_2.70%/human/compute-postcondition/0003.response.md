The only object in the loop head is the variable `test_cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, and `func_6()` has been called. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still be greater than 0.

Since the loop uses an underscore `_` as the loop variable, it is not used within the loop, and the iteration does not modify `test_cases` directly. However, the loop will decrement the number of remaining iterations by 1 each time it runs. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must have been greater than 1 at the start of the previous iteration, and now it must be greater than 0.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `func_6()` has been called.**
