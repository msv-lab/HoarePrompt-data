You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 8 : The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves a number of test cases from `func_1` and then calls `func_6` that many times. After the function concludes, `func_6` has been called a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_1`. The function itself does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` to read input. These functions are designed to handle different types of input lines, such as single integers, lists of integers, and lists of strings.
   - The main function `func_6` reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, then constructs the graph and the list of edges.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The graph is represented using a `defaultdict` of lists, where each key is a vertex and the value is a list of adjacent vertices.
   - The edges are stored in a list of tuples `(w, u, v)`, where `w` is the weight of the edge between vertices `u` and `v`.

3. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight. This is done to ensure that the lightest edge in a cycle is considered last, which is a key part of the algorithm.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - A `DSU` (Disjoint Set Union) data structure is used to manage the connected components of the graph.
   - The `DSU` class is not explicitly defined in the provided code, but it is assumed to have methods `find` and `union` to manage the components and their minimum edge weights.

5. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and uses the `DSU` to check if adding an edge would form a cycle.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., both vertices of the edge are in the same component), the edge is added to the component, and the minimum edge weight in the cycle is updated.
   - The program then uses a depth-first search (DFS) to find the vertices in the cycle.

6. **DFS for Cycle**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to find the vertices in the cycle starting from the vertex `node_u`.
   - The function uses a `colors` array to keep track of the visited status of each vertex. A vertex is marked as `1` when it is being visited and `2` when the visit is complete.
   - If a vertex is revisited (i.e., `colors[curr] == 1`), the function returns the path, which represents the cycle.
   - The function also ensures that the cycle includes the vertex `node_v`.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum edge weight in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Issues:
- **Edge Sorting**: The edges are sorted in descending order, which is incorrect. The edges should be sorted in ascending order to find the lightest edge in a cycle.
- **Cycle Detection**: The condition `if parent_u == parent_v` is used to detect a cycle, but the edge should be added to the cycle only if it forms a cycle. The current implementation adds the edge to the component even if it doesn't form a cycle.
- **DFS**: The `dfs` function is not correctly handling the cycle detection. It should return the cycle path when a cycle is detected, but the current implementation may return incorrect paths.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
