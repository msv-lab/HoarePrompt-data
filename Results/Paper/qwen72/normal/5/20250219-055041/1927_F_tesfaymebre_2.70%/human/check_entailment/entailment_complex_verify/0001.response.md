### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly uses `func_1`, `func_3`, and `func_4` to read the number of test cases, the number of vertices and edges, and the edges themselves. The functions are designed to handle the input format as specified in the problem description.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The graph is correctly represented using a `defaultdict` of lists, where each key is a vertex and the value is a list of adjacent vertices.
   - The edges are stored in a list of tuples `(w, u, v)`, where `w` is the weight of the edge between vertices `u` and `v`.

3. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight. This is incorrect for the problem's requirements. The edges should be sorted in ascending order to ensure that the lightest edge in a cycle is considered first.
   - **Annotation**: The state after sorting is that `edges` is a list of tuples `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by `w`.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - The `DSU` class is correctly implemented with `find` and `union` methods to manage the connected components of the graph and track the minimum edge weight in each component.
   - **Annotation**: The state after initializing `dsu` is that it has `n + 1` elements, and `_min_edge` is set to infinity.

5. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and uses the `DSU` to check if adding an edge would form a cycle.
   - The condition `if parent_u == parent_v` is used to detect a cycle, but the edge should not be added to the component if it forms a cycle. The current implementation adds the edge to the component even if it forms a cycle, which is incorrect.
   - **Annotation**: The state after the loop is that `node_u` and `node_v` are the last nodes that were unioned, and `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight among all the edges that were unioned.

6. **DFS for Cycle**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to find the vertices in the cycle starting from the vertex `node_u`.
   - The function uses a `colors` array to keep track of the visited status of each vertex. A vertex is marked as `1` when it is being visited and `2` when the visit is complete.
   - The function should return the cycle path when a cycle is detected, but the current implementation may return incorrect paths because it does not correctly handle the cycle detection logic.
   - **Annotation**: The state after the DFS is that `res` is the path found by the DFS, and `colors` is updated to reflect the visited status of the vertices.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum edge weight in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.
   - **Annotation**: The state after printing is that the output is generated for the current test case.

### Issues:
- **Edge Sorting**: The edges should be sorted in ascending order, not descending order.
- **Cycle Detection**: The edge should not be added to the component if it forms a cycle. The current implementation adds the edge to the component even if it forms a cycle.
- **DFS**: The `dfs` function should correctly handle the cycle detection and return the cycle path when a cycle is detected.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect. The edge sorting and cycle detection logic need to be fixed to ensure the program works as intended.

Final: **False**
