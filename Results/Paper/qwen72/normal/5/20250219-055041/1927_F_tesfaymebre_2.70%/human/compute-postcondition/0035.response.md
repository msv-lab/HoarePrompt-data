Output State: **`u` and `v` are now in the same connected component in the `dsu` object, `w` is the weight of the edge connecting `u` and `v`, `_min_edge` is still `inf`, `node_u` is still -1, `node_v` is still -1, `parent_u` is now the same as `parent_v` (which is the representative of the new connected component), `i` is still `m-1`, `m` is still greater than or equal to 3, `n` and `m` are still assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `edges` is still a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w`, and `graph[u]` still contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements, `graph[v]` still contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements.**
