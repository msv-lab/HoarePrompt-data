Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `curr` and `parent` are integers representing vertices in the graph, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it, `colors[curr]` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[curr]:
    if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent:
        res = dfs(nei, curr, path)
        set_res = set(res)
        if res and node_v in set_res:
            return res


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`curr` and `parent` are integers representing vertices in the graph, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it, `colors[curr]` is 1, `graph[curr]` must have at least one neighbor, `nei` is the first neighbor in `graph[curr]`. If `colors[nei]` is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, `res` is the result of the `dfs` function called with `nei` as the current vertex, `curr` as the parent, and the current `path`. `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`. Additionally, either `res` is empty, or `node_v` is not in `set_res`. If `colors[nei]` is 2 or `nei` is equal to `parent`, no changes are made to `res` or `set_res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`curr` and `parent` are integers representing vertices in the graph, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it, `colors[curr]` is 1, `graph[curr]` must have at least two neighbors, `nei` is the second neighbor in `graph[curr]`. If `colors[nei]` is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, `res` is the result of the `dfs` function called with `nei` as the current vertex, `curr` as the parent, and the current `path`. If `res` is not empty and `node_v` is in `set_res`, the function returns `res`. Otherwise, the function returns an empty list. If `colors[nei]` is 2 or `nei` is equal to `parent`, no changes are made to `res` or `set_res`, and the function returns an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`curr` and `parent` are integers representing vertices in the graph, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it, `colors[curr]` is 1, `graph[curr]` must have at least three neighbors, `nei` is the third neighbor in `graph[curr]`. If `colors[nei]` is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, `res` is the result of the `dfs` function called with `nei` as the current vertex, `curr` as the parent, and the current `path`. If `res` is not empty and `node_v` is in `set_res`, the function returns `res`. Otherwise, the function returns an empty list. If `colors[nei]` is 2 or `nei` is equal to `parent`, the function returns an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
