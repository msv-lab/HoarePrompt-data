You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), and graph and edges are initially empty.
def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `graph[u]` now contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements, `graph[v]` now contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)`, `i` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration.
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    node_u = -1
    node_v = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
            if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
                _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
                node_u = u
                node_v = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `graph[u]` contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements, `graph[v]` contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements. `node_u` and `node_v` are the last nodes that were unioned, and `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight among all the edges that were unioned.
    colors = [0] * (n + 1)
    res = dfs(node_u, -1, [])
    print(_min_edge, len(res))
    #This is printed: _min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the minimum edge weight among all the edges that were unioned, and len(res) is the number of nodes collected by the dfs function starting from node_u)
    print(*res)
    #This is printed: [nodes visited in the dfs traversal starting from node_u, including node_u and node_v] (where the exact nodes depend on the graph structure and the implementation of the dfs function)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and operates under the constraints that `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5). The function initializes an empty graph and an empty set of edges.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
