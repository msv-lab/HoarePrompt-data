Output State: **`curr` and `parent` are integers representing vertices in the graph, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it, `colors[curr]` is 1, `graph[curr]` must have at least two neighbors, `nei` is the second neighbor in `graph[curr]`. If `colors[nei]` is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, `res` is the result of the `dfs` function called with `nei` as the current vertex, `curr` as the parent, and the current `path`. `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`. Additionally, either `res` is empty, or `node_v` is not in `set_res`. If `colors[nei]` is 2 or `nei` is equal to `parent`, `res` remains unchanged and `set_res` remains the same set.**
