Output State: **`u` and `v` are now in the same connected component in `dsu`, `_min_edge` is updated to the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to the new parent of `u` and `v` as determined by `dsu.find(u)` and `dsu.find(v)` respectively, `node_u` is set to `u`, `node_v` is set to `v`, and `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is updated to `w` if `w` is less than the current `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `_min_edge` is now the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`.
- The values of `parent_u` and `parent_v` are still the new parent of `u` and `v` as determined by `dsu.find(u)` and `dsu.find(v)` respectively.
- `node_u` is still set to `u`.
- `node_v` is still set to `v`.
- The condition that `u` and `v` are in the same connected component in `dsu` remains unchanged.
- The condition that `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is updated to `w` if `w` is less than the current `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` remains unchanged.
- All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
