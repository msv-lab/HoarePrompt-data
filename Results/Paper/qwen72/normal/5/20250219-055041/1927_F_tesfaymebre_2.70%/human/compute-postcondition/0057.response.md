Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `graph[u]` contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements, `graph[v]` contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements. `node_u` and `node_v` are the last nodes that were unioned, and `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight among all the edges that were unioned.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variables `u`, `v`, and `w` have been updated with new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration.
- The adjacency lists `graph[u]` and `graph[v]` still contain `m` elements, each being the corresponding `v` or `u` value.
- The `edges` list has been fully processed, and `i` is now 0, indicating that all `m` tuples have been considered.
- The `dsu` object, which is a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) or Union-Find structure, has been used to union nodes based on the edges in the list.
- The variables `node_u` and `node_v` hold the last pair of nodes that were unioned.
- The variable `_min_edge` holds the minimum edge weight among all the edges that were unioned during the loop execution. If no edges were unioned, `_min_edge` remains `inf`.
