### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` to read input. These functions are designed to handle different types of input lines, such as single integers, lists of integers, and lists of strings.
   - The main function `func_6` reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, then constructs the graph and the list of edges.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The graph is represented using a `defaultdict` of lists, where each key is a vertex and the value is a list of adjacent vertices.
   - The edges are stored in a list of tuples `(w, u, v)`, where `w` is the weight of the edge between vertices `u` and `v`.

3. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight. This is done to ensure that the lightest edge in a cycle is considered last, which is a key part of the algorithm.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - A `DSU` (Disjoint Set Union) data structure is used to manage the connected components of the graph.
   - The `DSU` class is not explicitly defined in the provided code, but it is assumed to have methods `find` and `union` to manage the components and their minimum edge weights.

5. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and uses the `DSU` to check if adding an edge would form a cycle.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., both vertices of the edge are in the same component), the edge is added to the component, and the minimum edge weight in the cycle is updated.
   - The program then uses a depth-first search (DFS) to find the vertices in the cycle.

6. **DFS for Cycle**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to find the vertices in the cycle starting from the vertex `node_u`.
   - The function uses a `colors` array to keep track of the visited status of each vertex. A vertex is marked as `1` when it is being visited and `2` when the visit is complete.
   - If a vertex is revisited (i.e., `colors[curr] == 1`), the function returns the path, which represents the cycle.
   - The function also ensures that the cycle includes the vertex `node_v`.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum edge weight in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Issues:
- **Edge Sorting**: The edges are sorted in descending order, which is incorrect. The edges should be sorted in ascending order to find the lightest edge in a cycle.
- **Cycle Detection**: The condition `if parent_u == parent_v` is used to detect a cycle, but the edge should be added to the cycle only if it forms a cycle. The current implementation adds the edge to the component even if it doesn't form a cycle.
- **DFS**: The `dfs` function is not correctly handling the cycle detection. It should return the cycle path when a cycle is detected, but the current implementation may return incorrect paths.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
