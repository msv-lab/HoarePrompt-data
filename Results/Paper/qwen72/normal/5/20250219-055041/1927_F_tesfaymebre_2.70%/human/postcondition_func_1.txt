The function `func_2` reads the first line of input from the user via `sys.stdin`, removes any trailing whitespace from this line, and returns the modified line. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the user will have a string that represents the first line of input they provided, with any trailing whitespace removed.
