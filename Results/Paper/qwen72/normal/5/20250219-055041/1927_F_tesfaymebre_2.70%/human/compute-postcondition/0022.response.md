Output State: **The program returns an empty list or the list `res` which is the result of the `dfs` function called with `nei` as the current vertex, `curr` as the parent, and the current `path`. If `colors[nei]` is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, and if `res` is not empty and `node_v` is in `set_res`, then `res` is returned. Otherwise, an empty list is returned.**
