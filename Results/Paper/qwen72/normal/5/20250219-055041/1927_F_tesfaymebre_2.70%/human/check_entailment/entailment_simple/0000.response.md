### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` to handle input. These functions are designed to read different types of input (integers, strings, lists of integers, etc.) from standard input. The use of `func_3` and `func_4` to read the number of vertices and edges, and the edges themselves, is appropriate and follows the input format described in the problem.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The graph is constructed using a `defaultdict` of lists, which is a common and efficient way to represent an undirected graph in Python. The edges are stored in a list of tuples, which is also appropriate for the problem.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - The `DSU` class is used to manage the connected components of the graph. The `find` and `union` methods are implemented correctly. The `min_edge` array is used to keep track of the minimum edge weight in each component, which is a key part of the solution.

4. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight. This is done to ensure that the program processes the heaviest edges first, which helps in finding the cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.

5. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program attempts to find a cycle by iterating over the sorted edges and using the `DSU` to union the vertices. If a cycle is detected (i.e., the two vertices of an edge are already in the same component), the program updates the minimum edge weight and the nodes involved in the cycle.

6. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to find the cycle. It uses a `colors` array to track the state of each node (0: unvisited, 1: visiting, 2: visited). The function returns the path if a cycle is detected, and the cycle is printed correctly.

7. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the minimum weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle. It also prints the vertices of the cycle in the order they were visited.

8. **Thread Management**:
   - The program uses threading to manage the main function, which is not strictly necessary for the problem but is a valid approach to handle large inputs.

### Issues:
- **Cycle Detection Logic**:
  - The logic for detecting cycles and updating the minimum edge weight is flawed. The program updates the minimum edge weight and the nodes involved in the cycle only when the two vertices of an edge are already in the same component. However, this logic does not guarantee that the cycle found is the one with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.
  - The correct approach should be to find the cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge, which may not necessarily be the first cycle detected.

- **DFS Function**:
  - The `dfs` function is not correctly implemented to find the cycle. It should return the cycle path when a back edge is found, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly. The condition `if (colors[curr] == 1)` should be used to detect a back edge, and the cycle should be constructed from the `path` list.

### Conclusion:
The program has logical issues in the cycle detection and DFS implementation, which may lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Correctness:
**False**
