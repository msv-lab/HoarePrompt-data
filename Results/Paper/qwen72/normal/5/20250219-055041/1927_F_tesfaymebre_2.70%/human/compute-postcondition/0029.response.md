Functionality: ** The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal in a graph. It accepts three parameters: `curr` (the current vertex), `parent` (the parent vertex in the DFS traversal), and `path` (the current path in the DFS traversal). The function modifies the `colors` and `path` variables. If the current vertex `curr` is already being visited (i.e., `colors[curr]` is 1), it returns the current path. If a valid path is found from a neighbor of `curr` (excluding `parent` and any already fully visited vertices), and this path includes a specific node `node_v`, it returns this path. If no such path is found, it marks the current vertex as fully visited (i.e., `colors[curr]` is 2) and returns an empty list. The final state of the program is that the `colors` and `path` variables are updated, and the function returns either the current path or an empty list. **
