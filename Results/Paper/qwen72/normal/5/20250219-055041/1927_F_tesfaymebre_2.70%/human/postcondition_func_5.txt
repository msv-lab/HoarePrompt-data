The function `func_6` initializes an empty graph and an empty list of edges, then populates the graph and edges based on `m` iterations of values provided by `func_3()`. It sorts the edges in descending order by weight, processes them using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure to union nodes and track the minimum edge weight, and finally performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from a specific node to print the minimum edge weight and the number of nodes in the DFS traversal, followed by the nodes themselves. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. The final state of the program includes a populated graph, a sorted list of edges, and the printed results of the minimum edge weight and the DFS traversal nodes.
