Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` using `func_3()`.
   - It then reads the edges and their weights using `func_3()` and stores them in a graph and a list of edges.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented using a `defaultdict` of lists, which is a common and efficient way to represent an undirected graph in Python.
   - The edges are stored in a list of tuples, each containing the weight and the two vertices connected by the edge.

3. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight. This is crucial for the algorithm to find the cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - The DSU (Disjoint Set Union) structure is used to manage the connected components of the graph.
   - The `union` method in the DSU class is used to union two sets and update the minimum edge weight for the unioned set.
   - The `find` method is used to find the representative of the set to which a vertex belongs.

5. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and uses the DSU to detect cycles.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., the two vertices of an edge belong to the same set), it updates the minimum edge weight and the nodes involved in the cycle.
   - The cycle detection logic is correct, as it ensures that the cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge is found.

6. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to find the vertices in the cycle.
   - It uses a `colors` array to keep track of the visited status of each vertex.
   - The function correctly identifies cycles and returns the path of vertices in the cycle.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

8. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The `func_7` function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_6` for each test case.

The overall logic and implementation of the program appear to be correct and meet the problem description. The use of DSU for cycle detection and DFS for cycle traversal are appropriate and well-implemented.

Correctness: **True**
