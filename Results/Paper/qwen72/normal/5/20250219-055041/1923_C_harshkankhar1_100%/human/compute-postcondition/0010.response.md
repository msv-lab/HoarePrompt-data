Output State: **`a` is a list where the first element is 0, and the subsequent elements are integers provided by the input, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `c` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries and is now the second integer from the input, `c` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), `queries` is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 3, `x` is 1 if `a[3]` > 1 else `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + 1` if `a[2]` > 1 else `b[1]` is `b[0] + 2`, `b[2]` is `b[1] + 1` if `a[2]` > 1 else `b[2]` is `b[1] + 2`.**
