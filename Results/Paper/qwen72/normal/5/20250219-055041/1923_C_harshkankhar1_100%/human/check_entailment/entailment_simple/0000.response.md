Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, but it should take parameters as described in the problem statement. This is a critical issue because the function needs to handle multiple test cases and process the input accordingly. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):`.

2. **Array Initialization and Processing**:
   - The array `a` is initialized with an extra 0 at the beginning, which is not necessary for the problem. The array `c` should be used directly.
   - The array `b` is correctly initialized with zeros and is used to store the cumulative sum of the values that satisfy the condition \( b_i > 0 \) and \( a_i \neq b_i \).

3. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - The cumulative sum of `a` is calculated using `accumulate`, but `a` should be `c` instead. The cumulative sum of `c` is necessary to determine the sum of subarrays efficiently.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the function checks if the sum of the subarray \( c_{l_i} \) to \( c_{r_i} \) is less than the corresponding sum in `b` or if the query range is a single element (`x == y`). If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
   - The condition \( a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] \) is correct because it checks if the sum of the subarray in `c` is less than the sum of the subarray in `b`, which would mean that it's impossible to construct a good array `b` for that subarray.
   - The condition `x == y` is also correct because a single-element subarray cannot be good since there is no way to replace the single element with a different positive integer.

5. **Overall Structure**:
   - The program processes multiple test cases, but the function `func_1` is called without passing the necessary parameters. This will cause the function to fail when it tries to read input.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not match the problem description in terms of function parameters and does not handle the input correctly.

Correctness: **False**
