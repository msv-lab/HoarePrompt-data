You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a series of queries on an array `c`. It reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q` from input, followed by the elements of the array `c`. It then constructs a prefix sum array `a` and another prefix sum array `b` based on the elements of `c`. For each query, it reads a pair of indices `(x, y)` and prints 'YES' if the sum of elements in `c` from index `x` to `y` is at least the corresponding sum in `b` and `x` is not equal to `y`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input arrays and variables are consumed, and the results of the queries are printed to the console.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and initializes an array `b` of the same length with all elements set to 0.

2. **Array `b` Construction**:
   - The array `b` is constructed such that for each element `a[i]` in the array `a`, if `a[i] > 1`, then `b[i]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, it is incremented by 2.
   - This construction ensures that `b[i]` is always greater than 0 and different from `a[i]` for every index `i`.

3. **Prefix Sum Arrays**:
   - The program uses the `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module to create a prefix sum array `a` for the original array `a`.
   - Similarly, it creates a prefix sum array `b` for the constructed array `b`.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `x` and `y` and checks two conditions:
     - `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]`: This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray `a[x] to a[y]` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`. If this condition is true, it means that the subarray `a[x] to a[y]` cannot be transformed into a good subarray because the sum of `b` would always be greater.
     - `x == y`: This condition checks if the subarray is a single element. A single element subarray cannot be good because there is no way to create a different positive integer `b_i` for it.

5. **Output**:
   - If either of the conditions is true, the program prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1**: `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]`
  - This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray `a[x] to a[y]` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`. This is necessary because if the sum of `a` is less than the sum of `b`, it is impossible to find a `b` that satisfies the conditions.
- **Condition 2**: `x == y`
  - This condition checks if the subarray is a single element. A single element subarray cannot be good because there is no way to create a different positive integer `b_i` for it.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. It handles the input and output as specified in the problem description and uses efficient prefix sum arrays to answer the queries.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
