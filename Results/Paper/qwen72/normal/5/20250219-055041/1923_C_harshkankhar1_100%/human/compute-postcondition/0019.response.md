Output State: **`a` is a list of cumulative sums, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (n > 0), `q` is an integer (q > 0), `c` is a list of integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), `queries` is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` and `y` are input integers, and 'NO' or 'YES' has been printed based on the conditions.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet checks if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or if `x == y`.
- If either condition is true, 'NO' is printed; otherwise, 'YES' is printed.
- The values of `a`, `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `queries`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The values of `x` and `y` are input integers, and their values are used in the condition check.
- The output of the program is either 'NO' or 'YES', depending on the condition.
