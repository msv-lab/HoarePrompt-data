Output State: **`a` is now a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements from the initial `a` list, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `c` and must be greater than 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `c` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), `queries` is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is `n`, `x` is 1 if the last element in the initial `a` list was greater than 1 else `x` is 2, `b[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n` is `b[i-1] + 1` if the corresponding element in the initial `a` list was greater than 1 else `b[i]` is `b[i-1] + 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**
