The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`a` is a list where the first element is 0, and the subsequent elements are integers provided by the input, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `c` and must be greater than 0, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries and is now the second integer from the input, `c` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), `queries` is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 2, `x` is 1 if `a[1]` > 1 else `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + x`.**
