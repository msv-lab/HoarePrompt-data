Output State: **`a` is a list where the first element is 0, and the subsequent elements are integers provided by the input, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `c` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries and is now the second integer from the input, `c` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), `queries` is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 3, `x` is 1 if `a[3]` > 1 else `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + 1` if `a[2]` > 1 else `b[1]` is `b[0] + 2`, `b[2]` is `b[1] + 1` if `a[2]` > 1 else `b[2]` is `b[1] + 2, `b[3]` is `b[2] + x`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b[i] = b[i - 1] + x` updates the value of `b[3]` based on the value of `b[2]` and `x`.
- `i` is 3, so `b[3]` is updated.
- `x` is 1 if `a[3]` > 1, otherwise `x` is 2.
- `b[2]` is already determined based on the value of `a[2]`:
  - If `a[2]` > 1, then `b[2]` is `b[1] + 1`.
  - If `a[2]` ≤ 1, then `b[2]` is `b[1] + 2`.
- `b[1]` is also already determined based on the value of `a[2]`:
  - If `a[2]` > 1, then `b[1]` is `b[0] + 1`.
  - If `a[2]` ≤ 1, then `b[1]` is `b[0] + 2`.
- Therefore, `b[3]` is `b[2] + x`, where `x` is 1 if `a[3]` > 1, otherwise `x` is 2.
