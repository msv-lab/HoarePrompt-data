Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `queries`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). `n` and `q` are integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), respectively. `c` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9). `queries` is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The function processes these inputs and returns the results of the queries for each test case. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
