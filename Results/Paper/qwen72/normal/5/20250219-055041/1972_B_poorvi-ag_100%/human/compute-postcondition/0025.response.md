The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `results`. The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list, assigning each element to `i` in turn. For the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must have at least two elements, and `i` will be the second element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case and must have at least one element. For the loop to execute again, `results` must have at least two elements, and `i` will be the second element in the list.

State: **`t` is the total number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is not relevant, `n` is the last input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is the last input string, `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case and must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element in the `results` list**
