Output State: **The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins. The variable `t` is now an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.**
