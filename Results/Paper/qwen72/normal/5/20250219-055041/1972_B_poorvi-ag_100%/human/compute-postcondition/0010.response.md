The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 1, and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is an input string. If the number of occurrences of 'U' in `arr` is odd, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes'. If the number of occurrences of 'U' in `arr` is even, `results` is a list containing the string 'no'.**
