Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is an input string. If the number of occurrences of 'U' in `arr` is odd, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes'. If the number of occurrences of 'U' in `arr` is even, `results` is a list containing the string 'no'.***
