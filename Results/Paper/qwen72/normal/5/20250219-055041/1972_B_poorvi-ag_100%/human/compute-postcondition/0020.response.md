Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is the input string, `results` is a list containing an additional 'no' appended to it.** 

The code appends 'no' to the `results` list, regardless of the number of occurrences of 'U' in `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged. The `results` list now contains an additional 'no' element.
