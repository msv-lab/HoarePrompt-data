Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is the total number of test cases, and it is given that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `i` is not relevant to the problem.
   - `n` is the last input integer, and it is given that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `arr` is the last input string.
   - `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, and it must have at least three elements.
   - `i` is the third element in the `results` list.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly defined as the third element in the `results` list.
   - Since `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case and must have at least three elements, the third element of `results` will be either 'yes' or 'no'.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the third element of the `results` list, which is either 'yes' or 'no'.

Output: **'yes' or 'no' (where 'yes' or 'no' is the third element in the `results` list)**
