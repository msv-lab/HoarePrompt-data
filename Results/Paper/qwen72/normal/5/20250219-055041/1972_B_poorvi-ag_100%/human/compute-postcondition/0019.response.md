Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is the input string, `results` is a list containing an additional 'yes' appended to it.**

The code snippet `results.append('yes')` appends the string 'yes' to the list `results`. The other variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The condition about the number of occurrences of 'U' in `arr` is not affected by this code, so it still holds that if the number of occurrences of 'U' in `arr` is odd, `results` contains an additional 'yes' appended to it, and if the number of occurrences of 'U' in `arr` is even, `results` contains an additional 'no' appended to it. However, the code snippet provided explicitly appends 'yes', so the list `results` now includes this additional 'yes'.
