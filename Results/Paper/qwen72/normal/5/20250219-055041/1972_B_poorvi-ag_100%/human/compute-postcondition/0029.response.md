Output State: **`t` is the total number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is not relevant, `n` is the last input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is the last input string, `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case and must have exactly `t` elements.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` still represents the total number of test cases, and the variable `results` will contain exactly `t` elements, each of which is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the number of occurrences of 'U' in the corresponding input string `arr` for each test case. The variables `i`, `n`, and `arr` are not relevant to the final state of the loop, as they are not modified by the loop itself.
