Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is the input string, `results` is a list. If the number of occurrences of 'U' in `arr` is odd, `results` contains an additional 'yes' appended to it. If the number of occurrences of 'U' in `arr` is even, `results` contains an additional 'no' appended to it.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr = input()` updates the value of `arr` to the input string provided. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `results`) remain unchanged. The condition for appending 'yes' or 'no' to `results` based on the number of occurrences of 'U' in `arr` is still valid and will be evaluated after this code snippet.
