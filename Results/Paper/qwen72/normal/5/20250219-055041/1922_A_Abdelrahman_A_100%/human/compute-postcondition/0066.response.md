Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `tests` must be greater than 1, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string, and `counter` is the length of `c`. `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, or no character in `c` was found that is not in the corresponding position of `a` or `b`, and `no` is True.**
