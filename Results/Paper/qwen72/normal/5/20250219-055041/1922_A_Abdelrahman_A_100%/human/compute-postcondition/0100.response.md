Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `tests` must be greater than 2.
- `slength` is an input integer.
- `a` is a new input string.
- `b` is a new input string.
- `c` is a new input string.
- `counter` is the length of `c`.
- If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, `no` is False. Otherwise, `c` must have at least as many characters as the length of `a` and `b`, `counter` is the length of `a` or `b` (whichever is shorter), and `no` is True if all characters in `c` are found in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`.
- The current value of `no` is True.

Given the `print` statement:
```
print('NO')
```

The statement `print('NO')` will always print the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of the variables `i`, `tests`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `counter`, or `no`.

Output: **NO**
