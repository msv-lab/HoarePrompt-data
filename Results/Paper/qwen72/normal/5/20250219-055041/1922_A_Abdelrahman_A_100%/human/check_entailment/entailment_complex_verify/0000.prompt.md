You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but within the function, it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `i` is `tests - 1`, `tests` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string, and `counter` is the length of `c`. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, `no` is False. Otherwise, `c` must have at least as many characters as the length of `a` and `b`, `counter` is the length of `a` or `b` (whichever is shorter), and `no` is True if all characters in `c` are found in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. If `no` was initially True, it remains True after the if statement.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` containing lowercase Latin letters. The function reads the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and then, for each test case, it checks if the string `c` is either equal to `a` or `b`. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if each character in `c` is present in the corresponding positions of `a` or `b`. If any character in `c` is not found in the corresponding positions of `a` or `b`, it prints 'YES'. If all characters in `c` are found in the corresponding positions of `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it checks if a template can be constructed such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Specifically, the program checks if each character in `c` is not in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b` using the condition `if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]`. This condition is incorrect because it only checks if the character in `c` is different from the characters in `a` and `b` at the same position, but it does not ensure that `a` and `b` match the template correctly.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

Explanation:
For the input `a = "abc"`, `b = "def"`, and `c = "ghi"`, a valid template can be constructed as "ABC". Here, `a` and `b` match the template because all characters in `a` and `b` are different from the corresponding uppercase characters in the template. However, `c` does not match the template because all characters in `c` are different from the corresponding uppercase characters in the template. The program incorrectly prints "NO" in this case.

The correct approach should involve checking if for each position `i`, the characters in `a` and `b` are the same and are different from the corresponding character in `c` (or if `a` and `b` are different and `c` is different from both). The provided program does not handle this logic correctly.
