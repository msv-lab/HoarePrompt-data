Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `tests` must be greater than 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is an input string. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, `no` is False. Otherwise, `c` is not equal to `a` and `b`, `counter` is the length of `c`, and `no` is True unless a character in `c` was found that is not in the corresponding position of `a` or `b`, in which case `no` is False and the loop broke early.***
