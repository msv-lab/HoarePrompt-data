Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `tests` must be greater than 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is an input string, `no` is True, `c` is not equal to `a` and `c` is not equal to `b`, `counter` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
        no = False
        print('YES')
        break
    counter += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `tests` must be greater than 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is an input string that must have at least one character, `c` is not equal to `a` and `c` is not equal to `b`, `counter` is 1, `x` is the first character of `c`. If the first character of `c` is not in the first character of `a` and not in the first character of `b`, `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `no` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 0, `tests` must be greater than 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is an input string that must have at least two characters, `c` is not equal to `a` and `c` is not equal to `b`, `counter` is 2, `x` is the second character of `c`. If `x` is not in `a[1]` and `x` is not in `b[1]`, `no` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 0, `tests` must be greater than 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is an input string that must have at least three characters, `c` is not equal to `a` and `c` is not equal to `b`, `counter` is 3, `x` is the third character of `c`. If `x` is not in `a[2]` and `x` is not in `b[2]`, `no` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
