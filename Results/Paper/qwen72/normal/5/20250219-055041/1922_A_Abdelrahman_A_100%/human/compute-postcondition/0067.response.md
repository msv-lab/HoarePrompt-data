Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `tests` must be greater than 1.
- `slength` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is a new input string.
- `c` is a new input string.
- `counter` is the length of `c`.
- `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, or no character in `c` was found that is not in the corresponding position of `a` or `b`.
- `no` is True.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('NO')
```

This statement will print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The value of `no` being True does not affect the print statement directly, as the statement is simply printing a constant string.

Output: **NO**
