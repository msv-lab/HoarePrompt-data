Output State: **`i` is 1, `tests` must be greater than 1, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string that must have at least 3 characters, `counter` is 3, `x` is the third character in `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, `no` is False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
