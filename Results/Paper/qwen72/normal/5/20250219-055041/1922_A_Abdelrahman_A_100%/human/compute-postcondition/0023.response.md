Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `tests` must be greater than 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is an input string that must have at least two characters, `c` is not equal to `a` and `c` is not equal to `b`, `counter` is 1, `x` is the second character of `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, `no` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
