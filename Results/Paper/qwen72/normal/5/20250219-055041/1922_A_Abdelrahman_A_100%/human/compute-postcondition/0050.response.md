Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `tests` must be greater than 1, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, `counter` is 0. If the character `x` is not present in the first character of `a` and the first character of `b`, `no` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `no` remains True.***
