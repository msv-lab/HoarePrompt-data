You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but within the function, it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `i` is `tests - 1`, `tests` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string, and `counter` is the length of `c`. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, `no` is False. Otherwise, `c` must have at least as many characters as the length of `a` and `b`, `counter` is the length of `a` or `b` (whichever is shorter), and `no` is True if all characters in `c` are found in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. If `no` was initially True, it remains True after the if statement.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the length of the strings and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Initial Check**: The program checks if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, it immediately prints "NO" and moves to the next test case. This is correct because if `c` is identical to `a` or `b`, it is impossible for `a` and `b` to match the template while `c` does not.

3. **Template Matching Check**: If `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`, the program iterates through each character of `c` and checks if the character at the same position in `c` is not present in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. If such a character is found, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop. This is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the template matching logic.

   - The correct logic should be:
     - For each position `i` in the strings, the template `t` should have an uppercase letter if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from `c[i]`.
     - The template `t` should have a lowercase letter if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, and the lowercase letter should not be `c[i]`.

4. **Incorrect Logic**: The current logic in the program checks if `c[i]` is not in `a[i]` and `b[i]`, which is not the correct way to determine if a template exists. This check is flawed because:
   - `a[i]` and `b[i]` are single characters, so `x not in a[counter]` and `x not in b[counter]` are always true unless `x` is exactly `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
   - It does not consider the conditions for uppercase and lowercase letters in the template.

5. **Correct Logic**:
   - For each position `i`, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from `c[i]`, the template can have an uppercase letter at that position.
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template can have a lowercase letter that is not `c[i]`.

6. **Conclusion**: The program does not correctly implement the template matching logic and will produce incorrect results for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**
