Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `tests` must be greater than 2, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `counter` is 1, `x` is the second character in `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `no` remains True.***
