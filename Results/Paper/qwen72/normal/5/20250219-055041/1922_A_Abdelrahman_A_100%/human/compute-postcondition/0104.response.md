Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` containing lowercase Latin letters. The function reads the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and then, for each test case, it checks if the string `c` is either equal to `a` or `b`. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if each character in `c` is present in the corresponding positions of `a` or `b`. If any character in `c` is not found in the corresponding positions of `a` or `b`, it prints 'YES'. If all characters in `c` are found in the corresponding positions of `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. **
