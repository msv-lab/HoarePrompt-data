The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` representing the number of cities, a list of `n` integers in ascending order representing the distances of these cities from a starting point, an integer `m` representing the number of queries, and `m` pairs of integers `(x_i, y_i)` representing the indices of two different cities. The function processes these inputs to determine the closest city for each query.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a list of `n` integers in ascending order, an integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), and `m` pairs of integers `(x_i, y_i)` (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i). For each query `(x_i, y_i)`, the function returns the index of the city that is closest to the city at index `x_i` among the cities at indices `y_i` and the cities not included in the query. If the closest city is not unique, the function ensures that the closest city is determined uniquely for every city.**
