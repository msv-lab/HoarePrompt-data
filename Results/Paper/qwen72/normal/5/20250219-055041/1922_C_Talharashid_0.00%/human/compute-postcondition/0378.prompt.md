Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `m`, `m` is the new input integer, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the accumulated values of `s` at each step of the loop, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the accumulated values of `s` at each step of the loop, `t` is greater than the new input integer, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user and `len(lst)` must be greater than 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is the final accumulated value after all iterations.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    start, end = map(int, input().split())
    start -= 1
    end -= 1
    s = 0
    if start < end:
        s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])
        s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])
    else:
        s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start])
        s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])
    print(min(s1, s2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s1` is `abs(d2[end - 1] - d2[start - 1])`, and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end - 1]` and `d2[start - 1]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `s` is 0, `start` is an input integer minus 1, `end` is an input integer minus 1. If `start` < `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start + 1]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start + 1]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end - 1]` and `d2[start - 2]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
