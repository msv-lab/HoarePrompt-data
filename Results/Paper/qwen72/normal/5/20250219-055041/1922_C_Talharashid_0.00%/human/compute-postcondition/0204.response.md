To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `start != end`.

### Current State:
- `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is `m`
- `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0
- `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements
- `start` is `len(lst) - 3`
- `end` is 0
- `inc` is -1
- `d2[start]` is `s`
- If `mini` was equal to `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start + 1 + inc])`, then `s` is increased by 1.
- If `start + 1 - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start + 1 - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`.
- Otherwise, `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start + 1]` and `lst[start + 1 + inc]`.
- If `start + 1 - 1 <= -1`, `mini` remains unchanged.

### Loop Condition:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `start` is not equal to `end`.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition `start != end` depends on the values of `start` and `end`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `start` is `len(lst) - 3` and `end` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `start` must not be equal to `end`.

### Adjustments:
- `start` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is not equal to `end`.
- Given that `inc` is -1, `start` is likely being decremented by 1 in the loop body.
- Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `start` should be decremented by 1.

### New State:
- `start` is `len(lst) - 4` (since `start` was `len(lst) - 3` and it is being decremented by 1).
- All other states remain the same.

### Final State:
State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `start` is `len(lst) - 4`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `d2[start]` is `s`. If `mini` was equal to `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start + 1 + inc])`, then `s` is increased by 1. If `start + 1 - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start + 1 - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start + 1]` and `lst[start + 1 + inc]`. If `start + 1 - 1 <= -1`, `mini` remains unchanged.**
