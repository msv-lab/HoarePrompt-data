The provided code snippet reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `start` and `end`. This impacts the values of `start` and `end`, which were previously described as being derived from an input integer minus 1. The new values of `start` and `end` are now directly the integers provided by the user input.

Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` and `end` are input integers, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1. If `start` < `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` ≥ `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.**
