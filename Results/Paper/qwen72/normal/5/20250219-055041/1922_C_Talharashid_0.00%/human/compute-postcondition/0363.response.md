Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`. If `start` is less than `end`, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s1` is updated to `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`.
- The conditions for `s2` remain the same as in the initial state, as the code snippet does not affect `s2`.
- The values of `i`, `m`, `s`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged.
