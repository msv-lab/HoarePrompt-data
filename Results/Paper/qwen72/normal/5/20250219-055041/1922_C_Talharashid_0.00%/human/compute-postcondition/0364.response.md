Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s2` is updated to `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.
- The values of `i`, `m`, `s`, `start`, `end`, and `s1` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `s2` being the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start` is less than `end` is no longer relevant because `s2` is explicitly assigned the value `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.
