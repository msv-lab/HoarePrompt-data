Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between adjacent elements in the list `lst` from the initial `start` to `end - 1`, and `d1[start]` is `s`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains the same as the initial input integer, constrained between 1 and 10,000.
- **`i`**: Remains the same as the initial input integer `m`.
- **`d1`**: Still a defaultdict with a default value of 0. However, it now contains the cumulative sum `s` at the final value of `start`, which is `len(lst) - 1`.
- **`d2`**: Remains a defaultdict with a default value of 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains the same as the initial input integer.
- **`lst`**: Remains the same list of integers provided by the user.
- **`start`**: After the loop completes, `start` will be equal to `len(lst) - 1`, meaning it has iterated through the entire list.
- **`end`**: Remains the same as the initial value, which is `len(lst) - 1`.
- **`s`**: This variable accumulates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between adjacent elements in the list `lst` from the initial `start` to `end - 1`. If the minimum difference is between the current element and the next element, `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, it is incremented by the absolute difference between the current element and the next element.
- **`d1[start]`**: At the end of the loop, `d1[start]` will be equal to the final value of `s`, which is the sum of the minimum absolute differences as described above.
