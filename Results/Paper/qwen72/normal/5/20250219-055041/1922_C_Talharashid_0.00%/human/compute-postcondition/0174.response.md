Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between adjacent elements in the list `lst` from the initial `start` to `end - 1`, and `d1[start]` is `s`.**

The code snippet `start = len(lst) - 1` reassigns the value of `start` to `len(lst) - 1`, which is the same as its initial value. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.
