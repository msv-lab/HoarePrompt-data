To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(s1, s2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with a default value of 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `start` is the first integer from the new user input minus 1.
   - `end` is the second integer from the new user input minus 1.
   - `inc` is -1.
   - `s` is 0.
   - `m` must be greater than 2.

2. **Conditions and Calculations:**
   - If `start` < `end`:
     - `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`.
     - `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`.
   - If `start` â‰¥ `end`:
     - `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`.
     - `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.

3. **Understanding the defaultdicts:**
   - `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with a default value of 0. This means that if a key is not present in the dictionary, it will return 0.

4. **Determining `s1` and `s2`:**
   - Since `d1` and `d2` default to 0, the values of `d1[start]`, `d1[end]`, `d2[start]`, and `d2[end]` will be 0 if they are not explicitly set.
   - Therefore, the absolute differences `s1` and `s2` will be:
     - If `start` < `end`:
       - `s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start]) = abs(0 - 0) = 0`
       - `s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end]) = abs(0 - 0) = 0`
     - If `start` â‰¥ `end`:
       - `s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start]) = abs(0 - 0) = 0`
       - `s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end]) = abs(0 - 0) = 0`

5. **Final Output:**
   - In both cases, `s1` and `s2` will be 0.
   - The `min(s1, s2)` function will return the minimum of 0 and 0, which is 0.

Therefore, the output of the `print(min(s1, s2))` statement will be:
Output: **0**
