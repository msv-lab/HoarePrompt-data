Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `start` is 3, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is either `s + 1` if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` or `s + abs(lst[2] - lst[3])` otherwise, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `t` is greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `inc` is 1, and if `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[3] - lst[2])` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` remains the minimum of `abs(lst[3] - lst[4])` and 11111111, provided `start + 1 < len(lst)`. If `start + 1 >= len(lst)`, `mini` remains 11111111.**

Explanation:
- `start` is incremented by `inc`, which is 1, so `start` becomes 3.
- The other variables (`i`, `m`, `end`, `d1`, `d2`, `t`, `n`, `lst`, `inc`, and `mini`) remain unchanged, but the condition for `mini` is updated to reflect the new value of `start`.
- The condition for `mini` now checks if `start - 1 > -1` (which is true since `start` is 3), and updates `mini` to be the minimum of `abs(lst[3] - lst[2])` and the previous value of `mini`.
- If `start + 1 >= len(lst)`, `mini` remains 11111111.
