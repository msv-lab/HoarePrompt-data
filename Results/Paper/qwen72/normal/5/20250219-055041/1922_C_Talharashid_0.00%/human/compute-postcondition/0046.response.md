Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is `start + inc`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1` and `end` must be greater than 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini` if `start - 1 > -1`, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[0] - lst[start + inc])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, `d1[start]` is assigned the value of `s`.**

Explanation:
- The code `d1[start] = s` assigns the value of `s` to `d1[start]`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `start`, `end`, and `mini` remain unchanged.
- The value of `s` is updated based on the conditions described in the initial state, and then `d1[start]` is set to this updated value of `s`.
