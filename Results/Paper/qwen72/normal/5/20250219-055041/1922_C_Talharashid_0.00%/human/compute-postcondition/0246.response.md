Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `s` is 0, `start` is an input integer - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`. If `start` < `end`, `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[start + 1]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[start + 1]` and `d1[end]`.**
