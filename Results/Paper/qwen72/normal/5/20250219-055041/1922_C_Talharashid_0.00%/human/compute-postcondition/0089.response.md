Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations, and the final state is as follows: `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` remains 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `s` is the cumulative sum of the minimum absolute differences between adjacent elements in the list `lst` from the end to the beginning. The dictionary `d2` contains the cumulative sum `s` at each index from `len(lst) - 1` down to 0.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has finished running, and the variable `start` has reached the value 0, which is equal to `end`.
- The variable `s` now holds the cumulative sum of the minimum absolute differences between adjacent elements in the list `lst` as the loop moved from the last element to the first.
- The dictionary `d2` has been updated to store the value of `s` at each index from `len(lst) - 1` down to 0, reflecting the cumulative sum at each step of the loop.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `d1`, `n`, `lst`, `inc`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
