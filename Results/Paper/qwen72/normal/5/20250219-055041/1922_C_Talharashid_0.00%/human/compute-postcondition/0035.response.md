Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is `start + inc`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1` and `end` must be greater than 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111 if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` remains 11111111, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[0] - lst[start + inc])`. If `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `s` is further incremented by 1, and `d1[start]` is set to `s + 1`. Otherwise, `s` is further incremented by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, and `d1[start]` is set to `s + abs(lst[0] - lst[start + inc])`. `d1[start]` is now `s`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `d1[start]` is updated to the current value of `s`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
