Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1` and `end` must be greater than 0. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is the minimum value between `11111111`, the absolute difference of `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` if `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, and the absolute difference of `lst[0]` and `lst[-1]`. Otherwise, `mini` remains the minimum value between `11111111` and the absolute difference of `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` if `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`. The current value of `mini` is equal to the absolute difference of `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.**
