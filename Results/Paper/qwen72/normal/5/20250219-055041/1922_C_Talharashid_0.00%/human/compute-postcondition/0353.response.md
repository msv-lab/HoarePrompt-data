Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d2[end - 1] - d2[start - 1])`, `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`**

The value of `s2` is now `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
