Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is the first integer from the new user input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from the new user input minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `m` must be greater than 2, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` calculates the absolute difference between the values of `d1` at indices `end` and `start`.
- The value of `s1` is updated to this absolute difference.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
