Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` remains 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is an input integer, `end` is an input integer, `inc` is -1, `s` is the cumulative sum of the minimum absolute differences between adjacent elements in the list `lst` from the end to the beginning, `m` must be greater than 0**

Explanation:
- `start` and `end` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which means they are both integers provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `inc`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- `s` is still the cumulative sum of the minimum absolute differences between adjacent elements in the list `lst` from the end to the beginning.
- `m` must still be greater than 0.
