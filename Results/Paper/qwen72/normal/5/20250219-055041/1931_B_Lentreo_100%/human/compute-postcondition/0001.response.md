Output State: **`nums` is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`.** 

The variable `total` is assigned the sum of all elements in the list `nums`. The sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, and `n` remains the length of `nums`.
