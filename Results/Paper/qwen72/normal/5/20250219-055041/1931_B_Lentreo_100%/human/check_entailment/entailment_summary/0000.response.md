Reasoning:
The program is designed to solve the problem by checking if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The key idea is that if the sum of the amounts of water is divisible by the number of containers, the average amount of water per container can be calculated. The operation allows pouring water from any container to any container with a higher index, so the goal is to ensure that no container has less water than the average at any point during the process, as this would make it impossible to balance the water levels.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers. However, the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, so this check is redundant.
   - The function calculates the mean amount of water per container, which is the target amount each container should have.
   - The function then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a running sum `curr` of the deviations from the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that the total amount of water in the containers from the start to the current index is less than the required amount to reach the mean. This indicates that it is impossible to balance the water levels using the given operation, and the function returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, the function returns 'YES'.

3. **Execution Summary**:
   - The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the function. It ensures that the sum of deviations from the mean remains non-negative, which is a valid approach to determine if the water can be balanced.

Given the problem constraints and the behavior of the function, the program is logically correct and should work for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
